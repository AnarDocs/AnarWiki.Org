The Therapeutae were an ancient Jewish group in Alexandria, Greece, that
"rejected all forms of property."[^1] They resembled and may have
influenced the
"<a   href="Essenes.md" class="wikilink" title="Essenes">"Essenes</a>.

Philo writes that the Therapeutae especially considered but looked on
slavery “to be a thing absolutely and wholly contrary to nature, for
nature has created all men free” (De Vita Contemplativa 70).[^2]

According to Ross Arctor on *Libcom*:

> "They lived in Alexandria, each member in a separate hut, with a tiny
> chapel for prayer, something like the arrangement of the medieval
> Carthusians, and met at sunrise and sunset for community prayer, and
> once a day for a common meal. The most ascetic members ate only every
> other day, and a few only once a week. On the Sabbath, they met for
> more extended religious service, which included a sermon. On the major
> Jewish holidays, especially Pentecost, they began at sunset on the eve
> of the Holy Days with an ascetic but ceremonial feast, a sermon,
> prayers, and the antiphonal chanting of psalms and singing of hymns
> (between the separated men and women), and choral dancing in imitation
> of Moses and Miriam at the Red Sea. Facing the sunrise they prayed
> that the Light of Truth might illumine their minds and then returned
> to their solitary cells for study and contemplation."[^3]

Marxist theorist Karl Kautsky is critical of the Therapeutae:

> "It is quite possible that Alexandrian Jews brought the notions of the
> Therapeutae to Palestine and thereby influenced Essenianism. And yet
> the two are fundamentally different. The Therapeutae live in
> contemplative idleness on others’ labor, the Essenes work diligently
> and earn so much that they not only support themselves but have a
> surplus to share with the needy. Both reject private property, but the
> Therapeutae have nothing at all to do with the goods of the world.
> They hate work as much as pleasure, they renounce means of production
> as they do means of consumption, and hence distribute their property
> among friends and relatives. The Essenes labor, and for that they need
> means of production; accordingly their members do not distribute what
> they own among friends, but collect them in a fund for common use."

The movement's name comes from a name for traditionalist Buddhists,
according to an argument summarized on *Wikipedia*:

> "Linguist Zacharias P. Thundy suggests that the word "Therapeutae" is
> only a Hellenistic corruption of "Theravada", the Indian Pali word for
> traditional Buddhists.\[10\] Others suggest it would come more
> specifically from "Theraputta", the name applied to those of the
> Theravada school.\[18\]"
