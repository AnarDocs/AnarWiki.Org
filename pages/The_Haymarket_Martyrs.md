> May 1st is a day of special significance for the labour movement.

> The history of Mayday is closely linked with the anarchist movement
> and the struggles of working people for a better world. Indeed, it
> originated with the execution of four anarchists in Chicago in 1886
> for organising workers in the fight for the eight-hour day. Thus May

> It began in the 1880s in the USA. In 1884, the **Federation of
> Organised Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada**
> (created in 1881, it changed its name in 1886 to the **American
> Federation of Labor**) passed a resolution which asserted that *"eight
> hours shall constitute a legal day's work from and after May 1, 1886,
> and that we recommend to labour organisations throughout this district
> that they so direct their laws as to conform to this resolution."* A
> call for strikes on May 1st, 1886 was made in support of this demand.
>
> In Chicago the anarchists were the main force in the union movement,
> and partially as a result of their presence, the unions translated
> this call into strikes on May 1st. The anarchists thought that the
> eight hour day could only be won through direct action and solidarity.
> They considered that struggles for reforms, like the eight hour day,
> were not enough in themselves. They viewed them as only one battle in
> an ongoing class war that would only end by social revolution and the
> creation of a free society. It was with these ideas that they
> organised and fought.
>
> In Chicago alone, 400 000 workers went out and the threat of strike
> action ensured that more than 45 000 were granted a shorter working
> day without striking. On May 3, 1886, police fired into a crowd of
> pickets at the McCormick Harvester Machine Company, killing at least
> one striker, seriously wounding five or six others, and injuring an
> undetermined number. Anarchists called for a mass meeting the next day
> in Haymarket Square to protest the brutality. According to the Mayor,
> "nothing had occurred yet, or looked likely to occur to require
> interference." However, as the meeting was breaking up a column of 180
> police arrived and ordered the meeting to end. At this moment a bomb
> was thrown into the police ranks, who opened fire on the crowd. How
> many civilians were wounded or killed by the police was never exactly
> ascertained, but 7 policemen eventually died (ironically, only one was
> the victim of the bomb, the rest were a result of the bullets fired by
> the police \[Paul Avrich, **The Haymarket Tragedy**, p. 208\]).

> A *"reign of terror"* swept over Chicago, and the *"organised banditti

> Anarchists were very active in the Central Labour Union (which
