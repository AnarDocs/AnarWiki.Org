Time and again, supporting the lesser evil has produced the greater
evil. In 1932, German Social-Democrats supported the bourgeois candidate
Paul Von Hindenburg against Hitler, and Hindenburg appointed Hitler as
chancellor. In 1936, the <a href="Revolutionary_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="CNT-FAI">CNT-FAI</a> allied with the bourgeois republicans,
rather than forming an independent working-class front with the
revolutionary UGT, and the government repeatedly sabotaged the
revolution including by attacking anarchists in May the following year.
In summary, lesser evilism didn't even make sense even in these extreme
cases, when workers faced the threats of Adolf Hitler and Francisco
Franco.
