# Icelandic Commonwealth

The **Icelandic Commonwealth** (Old Norse: *Íslands þjóðveldi*), also
known as the **Icelandic Free State**, was a remarkable experiment in
<a href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a> that existed in Iceland
from 930 to 1262 CE. For over three centuries, Iceland operated without
a centralized government, police force, or executive authority, instead
organizing itself through voluntary associations, competitive
governance, and <a href="restorative_justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a>. This system
demonstrates both the possibilities and limitations of decentralized
organization in medieval Europe.

## Overview

The Icelandic Commonwealth emerged when Norse settlers, fleeing the
centralized authority of Harald Fairhair in Norway, established a unique
political system designed to avoid the tyranny they had escaped.[^1] The
Commonwealth was characterized as a
<a href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a> by modern historians,
with no executive body to enforce laws and no centralized authority
making unilateral decisions.[^2]

The system was built around the
<a href="Althing.md" class="wikilink" title="Althing">Althing</a>
(Alþingi), a national assembly that served as both legislature and
court, and a network of local assemblies called *things*. Power was
distributed among competing chieftains (*goðar*) who provided governance
services on a voluntary, contractual basis to their followers
(*þingmenn*).[^3]

This decentralized system allowed Iceland to develop sophisticated legal
institutions, cultural achievements, and economic prosperity without the
coercive apparatus of the state. However, it also contained internal
contradictions that would ultimately lead to its transformation into a
more hierarchical society.

## Culture

### Egalitarian Traditions

Early Icelandic culture emphasized equality, mutual aid, and collective
decision-making. As historian William Ian Miller notes, the society was
"of a communitarian nature" with "limited role of lordship, the active
participation of large numbers of free people in decision making within
and without the homestead."[^4]

The <a href="Icelandic_Sagas.md" class="wikilink"
title="Icelandic Sagas">Icelandic Sagas</a> reflect cultural values that
prioritized honor, justice, and community solidarity over individual
accumulation. Social relations preceded economic relations, with "the
nexus of household, kin, Thing, even enmity, more than the nexus of
cash, bound people to each other."[^5]

### Oral Culture and Law

Like other anarchist societies, Iceland maintained its legal and
cultural traditions through sophisticated oral transmission. The
<a href="Lawspeaker.md" class="wikilink" title="Lawspeaker">Lawspeaker</a>
(*lögsögumaður*) was responsible for memorizing and reciting the entire
legal code at the annual Althing, ensuring that law remained accessible
to the community rather than controlled by a literate elite.[^6]

This oral tradition prevented the crystallization of written law that
could be manipulated by rulers and kept legal interpretation close to
community understanding and consensus.

### Peaceful Conflict Resolution

Despite its reputation for feuding, Iceland was "more peaceful and
cooperative than its contemporaries" according to historian Birgir
Solvason. While England and Norway experienced "continuous struggle;
high in both violence and killings" from 800-1200 CE, Iceland developed
sophisticated mechanisms for peaceful dispute resolution.[^7]

The average battle involved fewer than 1000 people with only a 15%
casualty rate, reflecting cultural values that emphasized restoration
over destruction.[^8]

## Organisation

### The Goðorð System

The foundation of Icelandic governance was the *goðorð* system - a
network of competing chieftains who provided legal and military services
to voluntary followers. Crucially, the *goðorð* was "not delimited by
strict geographical boundaries," meaning individuals could choose which
chieftain to follow regardless of where they lived.[^9]

This created what libertarian scholar Roderick Long describes as a
competitive market in governance: "Chieftains did not hold authority
over territorially-defined districts, but competed for clients with
other chieftains from the same geographical area."[^10]

The office of chieftain was private property that could be bought, sold,
or inherited, but as Long notes, "just buying the chieftainship was no
guarantee of power" unless the chieftain could "convince some
free-farmers to follow him."[^11]

### The Althing Assembly

The national assembly, established around 930 CE at Þingvellir,
represented one of the world's oldest parliamentary institutions.
However, unlike modern parliaments, the Althing had no budget, no
employees, and met only two weeks per year.[^12]

The Althing was organized around the *Lögrétta*, a legislative council
comprising 39 *goðar* and their advisors who reviewed and amended laws
through collective deliberation.[^13] Decisions required consensus or
strong majorities, preventing any individual or small group from
dominating the process.

### Decentralized Court System

Iceland developed a sophisticated judicial system without centralized
enforcement. The country was divided into four Quarter Courts, each with
36 judges appointed by the *goðar*. A Fifth Court was later added as an
appeals mechanism.[^14]

Crucially, courts had no executive authority to carry out sentences.
Instead, "enforcement of a verdict became the responsibility of the
injured party or his family," creating a system of
<a href="restorative_justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a> based on
compensation rather than punishment.[^15]

The most severe penalties were outlawry and exile - essentially
expulsion from the community rather than imprisonment or execution. This
approach emphasized rehabilitation and restoration over vengeance.

### Communal Institutions

Alongside the *goðorð* system, Iceland maintained extensive communal
institutions inherited from Norse traditions. The **Hreppar** were local
communes comprising a minimum of twenty farms with five-member
commissions that served multiple functions.[^16]

These communes were "mutual insurance companies" that provided social
welfare, assisted with fire and livestock losses, and organized summer
grazing lands. Membership was mandatory for all farmers in a given area,
creating a comprehensive
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
network.[^17]

The Hreppar system demonstrates that early Iceland combined elements of
voluntary association (in the political sphere) with collective
provision (in the economic sphere).

## Economy

### Early Communal Economy

The early Icelandic economy was fundamentally communal rather than
capitalist. As the Spunk Archive analysis notes, "the economy barely
knew the existence of markets" with prices "subject to popular judgement
at the skuldaping ('payment-thing') not supply and demand."[^18]

Large-scale farming was organized around extended households and kinship
networks rather than individual proprietorship. Land was initially held
collectively or through extended family claims rather than as private
property in the modern sense.

The system was "more similar to Guild Socialism (which was based upon
guild's negotiating 'just prices' for goods and services) than
capitalism."[^19]

### Transformation to Private Property

The critical transformation occurred between the 10th and 11th centuries
when "the land was divided up (mostly through inheritance claims)" and
"this semi-communal mode of production changed" toward individual
possession.[^20]

By the late 11th century, tenant farming emerged where "the farmer
worked for a landlord," introducing "a form of wage labour, i.e.
capitalistic production" that "ensured that 'great variants of property
and power emerged.'"[^21]

This economic transition was crucial to the Commonwealth's eventual
collapse, as it created the wealth concentration that undermined the
egalitarian foundations of the political system.

### Market Relations vs. Social Relations

The introduction of capitalistic relationships fundamentally altered
Icelandic society. Market values began "to replace those associated with
honour, kin, and so on. Social relations became replaced by economic
relations and the nexus of household, kin and Thing was replaced by the
nexus of cash and profit."[^22]

This transformation from use-based possession to profit-oriented
property created the conditions for wealth accumulation and power
concentration that would destroy the Commonwealth's anarchistic
features.

## Why the Icelandic Commonwealth Was Not Anarcho-Capitalist

While libertarian scholars like David Friedman have claimed medieval
Iceland as an example of <a href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>, this interpretation
fundamentally misunderstands the society's economic and social
organization.

### Communal Foundation

As the Spunk Archive analysis demonstrates, Iceland "was not a
capitalistic system. In fact, like most cultures claimed by
'anarcho'-capitalists as examples of their 'utopia,' it was a communal,
not individualistic, society, based on artisan production, with
extensive communal institutions."[^23]

The early economy featured:

- Collective price-setting in local assemblies
- Extensive mutual aid through the Hreppar system
- Land held through kinship networks rather than individual ownership
- Production organized around extended households
- Social relations preceding economic relations

### Absence of Market Mechanisms

The early Commonwealth lacked the market mechanisms essential to
capitalism. The "limited role" of markets, communal price-setting, and
emphasis on honor over profit created an economic system fundamentally
different from capitalism.[^24]

Even when market relationships began to develop in the 12th century,
they were seen as corrupting traditional values and contributed to the
system's collapse rather than its success.

### Mandatory Mutual Aid

The Hreppar system required all farmers to participate in collective
provision for orphans, the poor, and disaster relief. This mandatory
mutual aid network contradicts the voluntary exchange principles that
anarcho-capitalists claim as fundamental.[^25]

Unlike anarcho-capitalist theory, which sees all relationships as
voluntary contracts, Iceland maintained extensive non-market
institutions for collective welfare.

## Dissolution and Lessons

### The Role of Wealth Concentration

The Commonwealth's collapse resulted directly from the concentration of
wealth and power that began in the 12th century. As the Encyclopaedia
Britannica notes: "the position of the godi could be bought and sold, as
well as inherited; consequently, with the passing of time, the godord
for large areas of the country became concentrated in the hands of one
man or a few men."[^26]

By 1220, "six prominent families ruled the entire country," leading to
the "internecine power struggle" that ended the republic.[^27]

This process demonstrates that systems based on private property and
wealth accumulation tend inevitably toward hierarchy and state
formation, regardless of their anarchistic origins.

### Economic Transformation Driving Political Change

The political concentration of power followed economic changes. The rise
of tenant farming and wage labor created dependency relationships that
undermined the independence necessary for genuine self-governance.[^28]

As workers became dependent on landlords for access to land, they could
no longer vote freely in assemblies, being "subject to sanctions from
their landlord for voting the 'wrong' way."[^29]

This demonstrates how hierarchy in economic relationships inevitably
spreads to political institutions, undermining democratic participation.

### External Pressure and Internal Weakness

The final collapse came when the King of Norway exploited internal
divisions to assert control. However, this external pressure succeeded
only because wealth concentration had already weakened the
Commonwealth's resistance to centralized authority.[^30]

The transformation from communal relationships to capitalist ones had
made Icelanders familiar with authority relationships, preparing the
ground for royal rule.

## Relevance to Anarchist Theory

The Icelandic Commonwealth provides important lessons for anarchist
theory and practice:

### Positive Lessons

- **Viability of Stateless Society**: Iceland demonstrated that complex
  societies can function for centuries without centralized government
- **Competitive Governance**: The *goðorð* system showed how governance
  services can be provided through voluntary association rather than
  territorial monopoly
- **Restorative Justice**: The legal system emphasized healing and
  compensation over punishment and imprisonment
- **Direct Democracy**: The Thing assemblies provided genuine popular
  participation in decision-making

### Critical Lessons

- **Wealth Concentration Destroys Freedom**: The rise of private
  property and economic inequality inevitably led to political hierarchy
- **Economic and Political Systems Are Interconnected**: Changes in
  property relationships drove changes in political power
- **Mutual Aid Requires Institutional Support**: The Hreppar system
  showed the importance of organized collective provision
- **Transition Periods Are Vulnerable**: Societies moving from
  communalism to private property are particularly unstable

### Why Anarcho-Capitalism Fails

Iceland's history demonstrates the fundamental flaws in
anarcho-capitalist theory:

- Private property creates rulership over defined territories
- Wealth accumulation leads to power concentration
- Market relationships undermine social solidarity
- Economic hierarchy spreads to political institutions
- "Voluntary" relationships become coercive when alternatives are
  eliminated

As anarchist analysis predicts, the Commonwealth's anarchistic features
lasted only as long as its communal economic relationships. When
capitalism emerged, anarchy disappeared.
