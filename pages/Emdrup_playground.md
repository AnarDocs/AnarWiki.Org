> The Emdrup playground was begun in 1943 by the Copenhagen Workers'
> Co-operative Housing Association after their landscape archi­tect, C.
> T. Sorensen, who had laid out many orthodox playgrounds had observed
> that children seemed to get more pleasure when they stole into
> building sites and played with the materials they found there. In
> spite of a daily average attendance of 200 children at Emdrup, and
> that ' difficult' children were specially catered for, it was found
> that 'the noise, screams and fights found in dull playgrounds are
> absent, for the opportunities are so rich that the children do not
> need to fight'.
