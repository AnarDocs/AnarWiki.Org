# Paris Commune

The **Paris Commune** was a revolutionary government that controlled
Paris from 18 March to 28 May 1871. During this brief period, the city
became a laboratory for radical social and political experiments that
would inspire anarchists, socialists, and revolutionaries for
generations to come.

## Background

### The Franco-Prussian War and Siege

The Commune emerged from the chaos following France's defeat in the
Franco-Prussian War. Paris had endured a brutal siege from September
1870 to January 1871, during which the working class suffered severe
hardships while the wealthy fled the city. The siege radicalised the
population, particularly the
<a href="National_Guard_(France)" class="wikilink"
title="National Guard">National Guard</a>, which had become dominated by
working-class soldiers.

### The National Guard

The National Guard had grown to about 300,000 men during the siege, with
units organised by neighbourhood. Working-class districts like
<a href="Belleville,_Paris" class="wikilink"
title="Belleville">Belleville</a>,
<a href="Montmartre" class="wikilink" title="Montmartre">Montmartre</a>,
and the <a href="Faubourg_Saint-Antoine" class="wikilink"
title="Faubourg Saint-Antoine">Faubourg Saint-Antoine</a> developed
highly politicised battalions that refused traditional military
discipline. Guardsmen often refused to wear uniforms, demanded the right
to elect their own officers, and discussed orders before obeying them.

### The Cannon Incident

The immediate trigger for the Commune was the government's attempt to
seize cannons that had been paid for by public subscription during the
siege. On 18 March 1871, government troops tried to remove 170 cannons
from Montmartre, but the operation failed when soldiers refused to fire
on civilians and instead joined them. Two generals,
<a href="Jacques_Leon_Clément-Thomas" class="wikilink"
title="Jacques Leon Clément-Thomas">Jacques Leon Clément-Thomas</a> and
<a href="Claude_Lecomte" class="wikilink" title="Claude Lecomte">Claude
Lecomte</a>, were captured and executed by angry crowds.

## Establishment

### Government Withdrawal

Rather than negotiate, the government of
<a href="Adolphe_Thiers" class="wikilink" title="Adolphe Thiers">Adolphe
Thiers</a> evacuated Paris entirely, withdrawing to
<a href="Palace_of_Versailles" class="wikilink"
title="Versailles">Versailles</a>. This left the National Guard's
Central Committee in control of the city. Elections were held on 26
March, resulting in a council of 92 members representing various
revolutionary factions.

### Organisational Structure

The Commune deliberately rejected traditional state structures. It had
no president, no mayor, and no commander-in-chief. Instead, it operated
through nine commissions that reported to an Executive Commission. This
decentralised approach reflected anarchist principles of
<a href="Self-governance" class="wikilink"
title="self-governance">self-governance</a> and opposition to
hierarchical authority.

## Administration and Policies

### Progressive Reforms

The Commune implemented numerous progressive policies that prefigured
later anarchist and socialist demands:

- **Labour Rights**: Abolished
  <a href="child_labour" class="wikilink" title="child labour">child
  labour</a> and
  <a href="night_working" class="wikilink" title="night work">night
  work</a> in bakeries
- **Workers' Control**: Granted employees the
  <a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
  title="right to take over enterprises">right to take over
  enterprises</a> deserted by their owners
- **Debt Relief**: Remitted rents owed during the siege and postponed
  commercial debt obligations
- **Tool Return**: Required pawnshops to return workmen's tools and
  household items valued up to 20 francs
- **Workplace Justice**: Prohibited employers from imposing fines on
  workers

### <a href="Separation_of_Church_and_State" class="wikilink"
title="Separation of Church and State">Separation of Church and
State</a>

The Commune took a strongly <a href="anti-clericalism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-clerical">anti-clerical</a> stance, declaring the separation
of church and state. It confiscated church property, closed Catholic
schools, and arrested over 200 priests, nuns, and monks. Some churches
were converted into socialist meeting clubs, reflecting the Commune's
commitment to secular, democratic spaces.

### Economic Experiments

The Commune established forty-three
<a href="Worker_Cooperative" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperatives">worker cooperatives</a>, demonstrating
practical alternatives to capitalist production. However, it
controversially refused to seize the
<a href="Bank_of_France" class="wikilink" title="Bank of France">Bank of
France</a>, with finance commissioner François Jourde arguing this would
destabilise the currency. This decision was later criticised by
<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and
other revolutionaries.

### Education and Culture

The Commune opened numerous schools, including institutions for women's
education. It also promoted cultural democratisation, with events like
the ceremonial destruction of the
<a href="Vendôme_Column" class="wikilink" title="Vendôme Column">Vendôme
Column</a> on 16 May 1871, which had honoured
<a href="Napoleon_I" class="wikilink" title="Napoleon I">Napoleon I</a>
and was seen as a symbol of imperial despotism.

## Crime

According to Marx, crime was virtually absent in the commune, stating:

> 'in fact, for the first time since the days of
> <a href="French_Revolution_of_1848" class="wikilink"
> title="February 1848">February 1848</a>, the streets of Paris were

## Women's Participation

Women played crucial roles despite being denied voting rights. Key
figures included:

- **<a href="Louise_Michel" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
  Michel</a>**: The famous "Red Virgin of Montmartre" who fought on
  barricades and later became a prominent anarchist
- **<a href="Nathalie_Lemel" class="wikilink"
  title="Nathalie Lemel">Nathalie Lemel</a>**: Socialist bookbinder who
  co-founded the <a

  class="wikilink"
  title="Women&#39;s Union for the Defence of Paris">Women's Union for the

  organised women workers

The Women's Union demanded <a href="gender_equality" class="wikilink"
title="gender equality">gender equality</a>,

title="wage equality">wage equality</a>, divorce rights, and the
<a href="prostitution_law" class="wikilink"
title="abolition of prostitution">abolition of prostitution</a>,
advancing feminist causes alongside revolutionary politics.

## Military Resistance

The Commune faced constant military pressure from the Versailles
government. Despite having an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 fighters, the
National Guard lacked military experience and coordinated leadership.
Notable military commanders included:

- **<a href="Jaroslav_Dombrowski" class="wikilink"
  title="Jaroslav Dombrowski">Jaroslav Dombrowski</a>**: A Polish exile
  and former Russian army officer who commanded Commune forces until his
  death in May
- **<a href="Louis_Charles_Delescluze" class="wikilink"
  title="Louis Charles Delescluze">Louis Charles Delescluze</a>**: Final
  military leader who died dramatically on a barricade on 25 May

The military situation deteriorated rapidly after the fall of strategic
positions like
<a href="Fort_Issy" class="wikilink" title="Fort Issy">Fort Issy</a>.
The Commune's forces were hampered by the lack of trained artillery
crews and the tendency of neighbourhood units to fight independently
rather than as part of a coordinated defence.

## Bloody Week

The final week of fighting, known as
*<a href="Semaine_sanglante" class="wikilink"
title="la Semaine sanglante">la Semaine sanglante</a>* (Bloody Week),
began on 21 May when government forces entered Paris. The Commune's
defenders built approximately 900 barricades throughout the
working-class districts.

### Communard Resistance

As the military situation became hopeless, some Communards began burning
public buildings, including the
<a href="Tuileries_Palace" class="wikilink"
title="Tuileries Palace">Tuileries Palace</a>, the
<a href="Hôtel_de_Ville,_Paris" class="wikilink"
title="Hôtel de Ville">Hôtel de Ville</a>, and the
<a href="Palais_de_Justice,_Paris" class="wikilink"
title="Palais de Justice">Palais de Justice</a>. These acts were both
practical military decisions to deny the enemy strategic buildings and
symbolic rejections of the old order.

### Government Repression

The government response was brutal. Captured Communards were routinely
executed without trial. Estimates of deaths during Bloody Week range
from 10,000 to 15,000, making it one of the bloodiest episodes in French
history. Over 43,000 prisoners were taken, with many subsequently
transported to penal colonies in
<a href="Penal_colony_of_New_Caledonia" class="wikilink"
title="New Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>.

## Anarchist Analysis

### Contemporary Anarchist Views

<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> praised the Commune as a
"rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting
both the existing state and revolutionary dictatorship. He saw it as
validation of anarchist principles of decentralised, bottom-up
organisation.

Many anarchists participated directly in the Commune, including
<a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory)" class="wikilink"
title="mutualists">mutualists</a> like Courbet and
<a href="Collectivist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian collectivists">libertarian collectivists</a> like
Varlin. Their involvement demonstrated anarchist commitment to practical
revolutionary action alongside theoretical development.

### Lessons for Anarchists

The Commune provided important lessons for anarchist theory and
practice:

- **Direct Democracy**: The electoral system and neighbourhood
  organisation showed alternatives to representative democracy
- **Workers' Control**: The cooperative experiments demonstrated
  practical applications of anarchist economic ideas
- **Anti-Authoritarianism**: The rejection of traditional state
  structures embodied anarchist opposition to hierarchy
- **Limitations of Reform**: The refusal to seize the Bank of France
  highlighted tensions between radical and moderate approaches

## Legacy

The Paris Commune became a foundational reference point for anarchist
movements worldwide. Its emphasis on direct participation, workers'
control, and rejection of state authority inspired later anarchist
experiments from the <a href="Revolutionary_Catalonia" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> to contemporary
<a href="Occupy_movement" class="wikilink"
title="occupy movements">occupy movements</a>.

The Commune demonstrated that ordinary people could organise society
without traditional authorities, providing empirical evidence for
anarchist claims about human capacity for self-governance. Its brief
existence proved that alternative social arrangements were possible,
even if they faced violent suppression by existing power structures.
