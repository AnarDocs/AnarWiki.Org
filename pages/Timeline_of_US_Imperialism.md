*Note: We acknowledge that occasionally, US hegemony CAN have benefits
(for instance,
"<a   href="Anti-Fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="killing Nazis">killing
Nazis</a>) and we do not support all groups opposed to US hegemony. The
US is also not behind every event in global politics, they are an empire
but not omnipotent. However, we strongly condemn US hegemony as most of
it leads to loss of life and the underdevelopment of countries,
condemning hundreds of millions to a life of poverty.*

A timeline of the actions taken by the

title="United States">United States</a> government in order to secure
greater
"<a   href="US_Hegemony.md" class="wikilink" title="hegemony">hegemony</a> and
power and wealth at the expense of people, both its own and abroad. We
include authoritarian regimes and dictatorships supported by the US,
coups supported by the US, interference in elections, invasions,
suppression of rebellions (domestic and abroad), bombing campaigns and
support for terrorist or guerilla groups. Actions against piracy and
retaliation against states that the declared war on the US are not
included on this list, except in situations where the US used it for
hegemonic gains or lied to their population.
