> In 1524, peasants and urban workers met in the Schwarzwald region of
> Germany and drafted the 12 Articles of the Black Forest, and the
> movement they created quickly spread. The articles, with Biblical
> references used as justification, called for the abolition of serfdom
> and the freedom of all people; the municipal power for people to elect
> and remove preachers; the abolition of taxes on cattle and
> inheritance; a prohibition on the privilege of the nobility to
> arbitrarily raise taxes; free access to water, hunting, fishing, and
> the forests; and the restoration of communal lands expropriated by the
> nobility. Another text printed and circulated in massive quantity by
> the insurgents was the Bundesordnung, the federal order, which
> expounded a model social order based on federated municipalities. Less
> literate elements of the movement were even more radical, as judged by
> their actions and the folklore they left behind; their goal was to
> wipe the nobility off the face of the earth and institute a mysticist
> utopia then and there.

> Social tension increased throughout the year, as authorities tried to
> prevent outright rebellion by suppressing rural gatherings such as
> popular festivals and weddings. In August 1524, the situation finally
> errupted at Stühlingen in the Black Forest region. A countess demanded
> that the peasants render her a special harvest on a church holiday.
> Instead the peasants refused to pay all taxes and formed an army of
> 1200 people, under the leadership of a former mercenary, Hans Müller.
> They marched to the town of Waldshut and were joined by the
> townspeople, and then marched on the castle at Stühlingen and besieged
> it. Realizing they needed some kind of military structure, they
> decided to elect their own captains, sergeants, and corporals. In
> September they defended themselves from a Hapsburg army in an
> indecisive battle, and subsequently refused to lay down their arms and
> beg pardon when entreated to do so. That autumn peasant strikes,
> refusals to pay tithes, and rebellions broke out throughout the
> region, as peasants extended their politics from individual complaints
> to a unified rejection of the feudal system as a whole.
>
> With the spring thaw of 1525, fighting resumed with a ferocity. The
> peasant armies seized cities and executed large numbers of clergy and
> nobility. But in February the Schwabian League, an alliance of
> nobility and clergy in the region, achieved a victory in Italy, where
> they had been fighting on behalf of Charles V, and were able to bring
> their troops home and devote them to crushing the peasants. Meanwhile
> Martin Luther, the burghers, and the progressive princes withdrew all
> their support and called for the annihilation of the revolutionary
> peasants; they wanted to reform the system, not to destroy it, and the
> uprising had already sufficiently destabilized the power structure.
> Finally on May 15, 1525, the main peasant army was decisively defeated
> at Frankenhausen; Müntzer and other influential leaders were seized
> and executed, and the rebellion was put down. However, over the
> following years the Anabaptist movement spread throughout Germany,
> Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and peasant revolts continued to
> break out, in the hopes that one day the church and the state would be
> destroyed for good.

> Kropotkin, in his essay on the origin of the state, mentions the
> Anabaptist movement as an example of anarchism, although present day
> members of Anabaptist sects and atheist oriented anarchists would
> undoubtedly be a little disturbed at such an association. Modern
> legatees of Anabaptism are the Mennonite, Amish and Hutterite sects.
> Basic to their teaching is the 'two Kingdoms' theology, which has its
> roots ultimately in Augustine's City of God. To Augustine there are
> two cities: the earthly city of self love and contempt for God and the
> heavenly city of love of God and contempt for self. The latter, or
> city of God, manifests itself on earth in the church. Since the church
> has elements both of the heavenly and earthly cities, it should not be
> identified as the city of the God. The state corresponds to the
> earthly city. A true Christian state works in close relation with the
> church, promotes the church and secures the peace. Church and
> Christian state are inextricably bound together in mutual dependence
> and obligation.
>
> This scheme, which became the model for the medieval conception of
> church state relations was modified by the Anabaptists. Thus the
> earthly city or kingdom represented by government and the state is
> seen as 'worldly' and un-Christian. There can be no such thing as a
> Christian state or government since it is founded upon the principle
> of the legitimate use of violence to compel obedience to law. Since
> violence cannot be used by Christians, they therefore cannot
> participate in government or in the administration of the state.
> Furthermore, Christians being right-minded individuals and members of
> the church, and therefore of the Kingdom of God, have no need for
> governments. Governments as institutions of the kingdom of this world
> are for worldly, evil-doing people. As long as there are the latter,
> governments are necessary. Christians must stand aloof from them to
> avoid participation in their operation. At the same time they should
> be obedient to them where it is within their conscience to be so. They
> should render unto Caesar. Such rendering, however, does not include
> being a member of a military organisation or a police force. Nor does
> it mean holding political offices or voting for them or serving on
> juries, which may send men to prison or to their death.

> The true Christian is a member of the Kingdom of God through the
> earthly organisation of the kingdom, which is the church. This in
> turn, is the community of believers and of those who practice the
> teachings of Christ in everyday life. In lieu of secular government,
> believers are under the guidance of congregations of which they are
> full, equal and voluntary members. The church is a voluntary
> contractual association; one does not have to belong. The member is
> expected to live according to the doctrine and the rules of the
> church. Such doctrine and regulations are not determined by an elite
> body of hierarchs, but represent the collective product of the total
> religious community.

> There are, however, clergy who are elected by lot from among the
> members of the congregation and they lead the church rituals and take
> a major role in interpreting church doctrine and in dealing with
> alleged wrongdoers. The ministers and bishops are the men of influence
> in the community who are at least readily able to sway a large part of
> a congregation, if not all, to their way of thinking. They do not have
> the power to make decisions arbitrarily by themselves, however. When a
> member of a congregation is accused of wrongdoing his or her case is
> heard by the whole membership and decided by it. The ultimate
> punishment is 'disfellowshiping' in which the errant member is
> expelled from membership, which in the close knit highly integrated
> order of the Anabaptist congregation has always meant a serious
> punishment. Before a person is given such a sentence, however, he is
> encouraged to make a public confession before the assembled
> congregation and ask for forgiveness. Such a request is invariably
> granted and the matter is ended. Refusal to do so is considered a
> defiance of the entire church and this defiance of the community
> ultimately, then, becomes the most serious offence. Disfellowship
> means not only that one is expelled from membership, but also that one
> is totally shunned by all the church and cannot share in the religious
> services. It is in this general manner that Hutterite colonies and
> Amish congregations operate today. They have no police or courts and
> do not apply to them, but settle their dispute within their own
> communities in a system without government or the state, but founded,
> of course, on the ultimate sanction of God's disapproval. Such a
> system, as much as others we have discussed, requires firm belief in
> the power of the supernatural sanctions. It demands such a dependence
> upon the community of believers that shunning and disfellowship are
> perceived as excruciating punishment and so are effective deterrents
> to deviant behaviour. Some so punished would not find it easy to
> continue in defiance of the congregation and at the same time continue
> residing among its members.
