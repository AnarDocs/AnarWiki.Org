# Marxism

## Overview

**Marxism** is a political philosophy and method of socioeconomic
analysis developed by 19th-century German philosophers
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a> and
"<a   href="Friedrich_Engels.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">"Friedrich Engels</a>. It views
"<a   href="class_struggle.md" class="wikilink" title="class struggle">"class
struggle</a> as the central driving force of historical change and
advocates for the overthrow of
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
through "<a   href="proletarian_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="proletarian revolution">"proletarian revolution</a>.

From an
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
perspective, Marxism represents a fundamentally authoritarian approach
to achieving socialism that has consistently produced state capitalist
tyrannies rather than the classless, stateless society it claims to
seek. While sharing anarchism's critique of capitalism and goal of a
free society, Marxism's reliance on state power and
"<a   href="centralization.md" class="wikilink"
title="centralization">"centralization</a> makes it incompatible with
genuine human liberation.

## Scope and Distinctions

It is important to clarify that Marxism and
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a>
operate on different analytical levels. Marxism is primarily a theory of
economic analysis - specifically analyzing
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>,
which is a historically recent phenomenon only a few hundred years old.
Anarchism, by contrast, is a theory of hierarchy analysis that applies
to the entirety of human history, examining power relations
independently of any particular economic system.

While anarchists may find Marx's economic critique of capitalism useful
to varying degrees, they are not bound by his analysis or conclusions.
These frameworks sometimes overlap - particularly in their critique of
capitalist exploitation - but fundamentally address different questions.
Hierarchical domination and power relations remain relevant across all
human societies and epochs, whereas capitalism as a specific mode of
production is temporary and historically contingent.

Even Marx himself acknowledged that capitalism would eventually be
superseded, yet anarchists observe that hierarchy, coercion, and
domination long predated capitalism and could easily survive it in
different forms - as indeed they have in every "socialist" state that
attempted to implement Marx's program.

## Influences & Origins

Marx synthesized many existing ideas rather than creating wholly
original concepts. The main components of Marxism drew heavily from
earlier thinkers:

### Communism and Statelessness

The concept of communism as a stateless society came from earlier
theorists including:

- **Étienne Cabet** - described communist communities in "Voyage to
  Icaria" (1840)
- **Charles Fourier** - proposed voluntary communist communes
  (Phalansteries) without state coercion
- **Robert Owen** - conducted communistic experiments
- **Saint-Simon** - advocated replacing "government of persons" with
  "administration of things"[^1]

Ironically, most early "communists" like Cabet were quite authoritarian
and statist. The "stateless" element came more from anarchist influences
that Marx incorporated while denying their contribution.

### Class Analysis

Marx himself admitted he didn't invent class analysis. In an 1852 letter
to Weydemeyer, he wrote that what was new was proving "that the
existence of classes is only bound up with particular, historical phases
in the development of production."[^2]

The actual origins of class analysis came from:

- **French Liberal Historians** - Augustin Thierry, François Guizot, and
  Adolphe Thiers analyzed history as class conflict
- **Saint-Simon** - distinguished between "industrials" (productive
  classes) and "idlers" (parasitic classes)
- **Adam Smith and David Ricardo** - analyzed conflicts between
  landlords, capitalists, and workers
- **The Chartists and Early British Socialists** - used class language
  extensively in the 1830s-40s

Marx's contribution was systematizing this into a theory of historical
development and making the proletariat the revolutionary agent.

### Dictatorship of the Proletariat

The phrase itself appears to originate with Marx (first clear use in
1850), though some trace similar phrases to Joseph Weydemeyer. However,
the concept behind it came from:

- **The French Revolution** - Jacobin dictatorship, Committee of Public
  Safety, Robespierre
- **Auguste Blanqui** - revolutionary dictatorship by conspiratorial
  elite
- **Roman Republic** - temporary dictatorship during crisis
- **Babeuf's Conspiracy** - elite-led revolutionary government

Marx essentially combined class analysis (dictatorship BY the
proletariat) with the French revolutionary tradition (dictatorship as
temporary emergency measure) and Blanquist insurrectionism (small group
seizing power). This is why anarchists like
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> immediately recognized it as
authoritarian - it was adapting authoritarian precedents with a class
label.

### Withering Away of the State

This concept came primarily from **Henri de Saint-Simon**, who
explicitly advocated replacing "government of persons" with
"administration of things." It was also influenced by:

- **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon** - advocated complete dissolution of the
  state, replacement with federation
- **Charles Fourier** - voluntary association without state coercion
- **Anarchist critiques** - forced Marx and Engels to add "withering" to
  avoid seeming purely statist

The specific formulation (dictatorship THEN withering) appears to be
Marx and Engels' synthesis, attempting to reconcile Saint-Simon's
administration of things with Blanqui's revolutionary dictatorship and
their own embarrassment at seeming too statist after anarchist
criticism.

### Centralized Socialism

Marx and Engels were actually MORE centralist than most predecessors.
Their advocacy for centralized state control originated from:

- **Babeuf's Conspiracy** - centralized revolutionary dictatorship
- **Auguste Blanqui** - elite revolutionary vanguard seizing state power
- **Étienne Cabet's Icarian communism** - highly centralized, regulated
  communities
- **Louis Blanc** - "Social Workshops" organized by the state (1848)
- **Ferdinand Lassalle** - state socialism, state-aided cooperatives

The Communist Manifesto's call for "centralizing all instruments of
production in the hands of the State" was quite extreme even for the
time.

## Core Concepts

### Historical Materialism

"<a   href="Historical_materialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Historical materialism">"Historical materialism</a> (also called
dialectical materialism or the materialist conception of history)
constitutes the essence of Marxism. Engels defined it in his
introduction to Marx's *Critique of Political Economy*:

> "All past history was the history of class struggles... these warring
> classes of society are always the products of the conditions of
> production and exchange, in a word, of the economic condition of the
> time; therefore the economic structure of society always forms the
> real basis from which, in the last analysis, is to be explained, the
> whole superstructure of legal and political institutions as well as
> the religious, philosophical, and other conceptions of each historical
> period."[^3]

**Anarchist Critique:** This economic determinism ignores the decisive
importance of non-economic factors in shaping history. As
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> argued over a century ago:

> "Marx holds that the political condition of each country is always the
> faithful expression of its economic situation. He takes no account of
> other factors in history such as the ever-present reaction of
> political, juridical and religious institutions on the economic
> situation. He says poverty produces political slavery, the State, but
> ignores the fact that political slavery, the State, reproduces, in its
> turn, and maintains poverty as a condition for its own existence."[^4]

Even Engels himself admitted the flaw in economic determinism: "Causes
and effects are constantly changing places and what is now or here an
effect becomes there or then a cause and vice-versa."[^5] If this is
true, then the fundamental dogma that the economic "base" determines the
political and cultural "superstructure" is demonstrably false.

### Labour Theory of Value

The "<a   href="labour_theory_of_value.md" class="wikilink"
title="labour theory of value">"labour theory of value</a> posits that
the value of a commodity equals the socially necessary labour time
required to produce it. Under capitalism, workers produce more value
than they receive in wages, creating
"<a   href="surplus_value.md" class="wikilink" title="surplus value">"surplus
value</a> that capitalists appropriate as profit.

**Anarchist Critique:** While Marx's critique of capitalist exploitation
has value, the rigid labour theory of value has been extensively
criticized. It leaves out the forces of nature, science and technology,
and consumer demand. The "<a   href="Austrian_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Austrian School">"Austrian School</a> economists and others have
argued that subjective individual evaluations, not just labour time,
create value. As British economist Alfred Marshall argued, "It is not
true that the spinning of yarn in a factory is the product of the labour
of the operatives. It is the product of their labour, together with that
of the employer and subordinate managers, and of the capital
employed."[^6]

### Class Struggle and Revolution

According to Marx, capitalism contains internal contradictions that fuel
class conflict between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and the
"<a   href="proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="proletariat">"proletariat</a> (working class). This conflict will
inevitably lead to proletarian revolution and the establishment of
socialism.

**Anarchist Critique:** Marx grossly underestimated nationalism, which
has repeatedly trumped class consciousness. When World War I came, the
supposedly "revolutionary" working class became rabid nationalists, with
even German Socialist Party deputies voting for war credits. As Bakunin
predicted, bourgeois-minded workers in advanced industrialized countries
have not made the revolutions Marx expected. Instead, major revolutions
occurred in agrarian Russia and China, contradicting Marx's predictions.

More fundamentally, workers are not just economic actors. What they
think and feel - their attachment to nation, religion, tradition - may
determine their reactions more than their position in production. As
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> emphasized, co-operation rather than conflict lies at the
root of human society, and Marx's exclusive focus on class struggle
distorts this reality.

## The State Question

### Marx's State Theory

Marx agreed with anarchists that the state is essentially a repressive
institution serving the ruling class. A free society would abandon the
state altogether. However, Marx argued that:

1.  The working class must seize state power or create its own "workers'
    state"
2.  This state would repress capitalists and nationalize the economy
3.  The state would eventually "wither away" as classes disappear

**Anarchist Critique:** As "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> warned, the state is not
merely an agent of the economic ruling class, but constitutes a class in
itself - the most powerful of all by virtue of its monopoly of armed
force. The state is not only the product but also the creator and
perpetuator of inequality.

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> prophetically warned in 1910: "To hand over to the state
all the main sources of economic life, as also the management of all the
main branches of industry, would mean to create a new instrument of
tyranny. State capitalism would only increase the power of bureaucracy
and capitalism."[^7]

History has proven the anarchists right. As the economist Sidney Hook
stated flatly, "the existence of the Soviet Union refutes the theory of
historical materialism, since the basic economic changes were achieved
through political action \[the State\]."[^8]

### The Paris Commune

Marx praised the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">"Paris
Commune</a> of 1871 as a model of the
"<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a>. The Commune established:

- Election and recall of officials by neighborhood sections
- Workers' wages for officials
- Merger of executive and legislative functions
- Armed people instead of standing army

**Anarchist Critique:** While the Commune had libertarian elements, Marx
never raised the value of face-to-face, local,
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a>. He praised only an
extremely democratic version of representative democracy. More
importantly, as soon as the Commune was crushed, Marx redoubled efforts
to get the "<a   href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">"First International</a> to promote workers'
electoral parties to run in elections and take over existing states -
the opposite of the revolutionary-libertarian meaning of the Paris
Commune.

The anarchist "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> had already proposed true
federalism: "I am a convinced supporter of economic and social equality,
for I know that outside of equality, liberty, justice, human dignity,
and morality are all nothing but lies. But being at the same time a
supporter of liberty - the first condition of humanity - I think that
equality should be established in the world by the spontaneous
organization of labour and of collective property, through the free
organization of producing associations which will federate among
themselves."[^9]

## Marxism in Practice

### Economic Determinism and Class Collaboration

Marx's economic determinism led to catastrophic political conclusions.
According to the theory, capitalism must fully develop before socialism
becomes possible. Marx wrote: "No social formation ever disappears
before all the productive forces are developed for which it has
room."[^10]

This led Marx and Engels to support:

- **Slavery in America** - Marx argued in 1847 that "slavery is an
  economic category, like any other... slavery is just as much the pivot
  of bourgeois industry as machinery or credit... without slavery you
  have no cotton, without cotton, you have no modern industry."[^11]

<!-- -->

- **Colonial Conquest** - Marx and Engels argued that German
  colonization of Slavic peoples introduced "commerce, industry,
  agricultural science and education" to "stubborn" and backward
  peoples.[^12]

<!-- -->

- **War and Militarism** - Engels declared that "militarism dominates
  and is swallowing Europe. But this militarism carries within itself
  the seed of its own destruction" and that "gunpowder and other
  inventions revolutionize warfare and represent economic advance."[^13]

<!-- -->

- **Bismarck and Political Centralization** - Engels wrote to anarchist
  Carlo Cafiero that Bismarck "rendered immense service to the
  Revolution by creating political centralization."[^14]

**Anarchist Response:** This catastrophic policy, which led to the
emasculation of the socialist movement and its absorption into the
capitalist state, rendered the German socialist movement (numerically
the strongest in the world) impotent to resist World War I as well as
the rise of Nazi fascism.

### Social Democracy

The first major Marxist movement produced the social-democratic parties
of Europe. Engels himself extolled parliamentary action: "If this goes
on, we shall at the close of the century win over the greater part of
the middle social layers, the petty bourgeoisie as well as the small
peasants, and we shall come to be the decisive power in the land... the
Social Democratic revolution is getting on first rate while abiding by
the law."[^15]

This led to class collaboration, support for imperialism, and betrayal
of revolutionary principles. The German Social Democratic Party voted
for war credits in 1914, betraying the international working class.

### Bolshevism and State Capitalism

"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lenin&#39;s">"Lenin's</a> attempt to return to revolutionary
Marxism produced an even worse result. The
"<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">"Russian Revolution</a> created a totalitarian
state capitalist regime that:

- Suppressed workers' councils (soviets) and factory committees
- Banned opposition parties and factions within the Communist Party
- Crushed the "<a   href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Kronstadt Rebellion">"Kronstadt Rebellion</a> of revolutionary
  sailors and workers
- Established one-party dictatorship and secret police terror
- Centralized all economic power in state hands

Under
"<a   href="Joseph_Stalin.md" class="wikilink" title="Stalin">"Stalin</a>, this
system murdered millions through forced collectivization, labor camps,
purges, and manufactured famines.

**Anarchist Analysis:** This was not a "betrayal" of Marxism but its
logical outcome. As Bakunin had predicted: "The Marxists console
themselves with the idea that this \[state\] dictatorship will be
temporary. They say that the only care and objective will be to educate
and elevate the people economically and politically to such a degree
that no government will be necessary. But then they begin to contradict
themselves. They say, since the proletariat will be the ruling class,
who will it dominate? There will still remain another proletariat which
will be subjected to this new domination, this new State."[^16]

### Other Marxist States

Similar patterns emerged wherever Marxist parties took power:

- **China** under
  "<a   href="Mao_Zedong.md" class="wikilink" title="Mao Zedong">"Mao Zedong</a> -
  the "<a   href="Cultural_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Cultural Revolution">"Cultural Revolution</a>,
  "<a   href="Great_Leap_Forward.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Great Leap Forward">"Great Leap Forward</a>, and ongoing
  authoritarian rule
- **Cambodia** under Pol Pot - genocide of millions
- **North Korea** - hereditary totalitarian dynasty
- **Cuba** - one-party dictatorship lasting decades
- **Eastern Europe** - Soviet-imposed regimes crushed by their own
  working classes

In every case, Marxist parties created state capitalist systems where a
new bureaucratic ruling class exploited workers through state ownership
of the means of production.

## Comparison to Religion

Marxism functions as a secular religion, replacing traditional religious
dogma with ostensibly "scientific" dogma. As
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> observed, Marx wanted to
replace:

- **God with the State** - The state becomes the supreme entity that
  will solve all problems
- **Priests with "scientific socialists"** - Party intellectuals become
  the keepers of doctrinal truth
- **Faith with "scientific" certainty** - Marxists claim absolute
  knowledge of historical laws
- **Religious authority with party authority** - The party demands
  obedience as God's representative on earth

Like Christianity, Marxism offers:

- **Original Sin** - class society and private property
- **Prophecy** - inevitable collapse of capitalism
- **Salvation** - the revolution and communist society
- **The Elect** - the proletariat as chosen people
- **Heresy** - deviation from the party line
- **Excommunication** - expulsion of dissenters
- **Holy Books** - the sacred texts of Marx, Engels, Lenin
- **Priesthood** - the vanguard party
- **Heaven** - the future communist utopia

Engels admitted this quasi-religious character when he wrote that "the
communism of the German Social Democracy" rested on "an almost purely
Utopian basis, on a kind of religious faith."[^17]

The totalitarian tendencies of Marxism stem partly from this religious
structure. Those who believe they possess absolute truth about the laws
of history feel justified in forcing others to follow their policies.
"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">"Lenin</a>
certainly had this consciousness, as did all subsequent Marxist
dictators.

## The First International Split

The split in the "<a   href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">"First International</a> (International
Workingmen's Association) between Marxists and anarchists in 1872
revealed fundamental differences that remain today.

The anarchist position, articulated by Bakunin, argued for:

- Immediate abolition of the state, not seizure of state power
- "<a   href="Federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Federalism">"Federalism</a>
  and decentralization rather than centralization
- Direct workers' control of production, not state ownership
- Spontaneous revolution from below, not vanguard party leadership
- Freedom and autonomy for all sections of the International

The Marxist position, defended by Marx and Engels, insisted on:

- Conquest of political power through workers' parties
- Centralized state control of the economy
- "<a   href="Democratic_centralism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Democratic centralism">"Democratic centralism</a> and party
  discipline
- Subordination of national sections to the General Council

Marx used his control of the General Council to expel the anarchists and
relocate the International to New York, effectively killing it. He could
not tolerate the autonomous, federalist structure the anarchists
advocated.

**Historical Verdict:** The anarchists were proven right. Every attempt
to implement the Marxist program has led to authoritarian states, while
anarchist and "<a   href="anarcho-syndicalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalist">"anarcho-syndicalist</a> experiments
(Revolutionary Spain, Free Territory of Ukraine, Zapatista communities)
have demonstrated the viability of libertarian socialism.

## Anarchist Marxists / Libertarian Marxism

Despite Marxism's authoritarian core, some Marxists have attempted to
develop libertarian interpretations. These include:

### Council Communism

Emerging from the German and Dutch left after World War I, council
communists like
"<a   href="Anton_Pannekoek.md" class="wikilink" title="Anton Pannekoek">"Anton
Pannekoek</a> and
"<a   href="Otto_Rühle.md" class="wikilink" title="Otto Rühle">"Otto Rühle</a>
argued for:

- Workers' councils as the basis of revolution
- Rejection of the Leninist vanguard party
- Opposition to trade union bureaucracy
- Workers' self-management of industry

Council communists were closer to anarcho-syndicalism than orthodox
Marxism.

### Autonomist Marxism

Developed by theorists like
"<a   href="Antonio_Negri.md" class="wikilink" title="Antonio Negri">"Antonio
Negri</a>, autonomism emphasizes:

- Autonomous workers' struggles independent of parties
- Social struggle beyond the factory
- Rejection of centralized organization
- Creativity and self-valorization of the working class

### Left Communism

Left communists criticized Bolshevism from a Marxist perspective,
arguing Lenin betrayed workers' power.
"<a   href="Rosa_Luxemburg.md" class="wikilink" title="Rosa Luxemburg">"Rosa
Luxemburg</a> warned: "Freedom only for the supporters of the
government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they
may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom
for the one who thinks differently."[^18]

### Marxist Anarchism

Some anarchists have found Marx's economic analysis useful while
rejecting his politics. This includes:

- "<a   href="Daniel_Guérin.md" class="wikilink" title="Daniel Guérin">"Daniel
  Guérin</a> - synthesized anarchism and Marxism
- "<a   href="Cornelius_Castoriadis.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Cornelius Castoriadis">"Cornelius Castoriadis</a> - developed
  autonomous Marxism
- "<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Murray Bookchin">"Murray Bookchin</a> - combined Marx's class
  analysis with anarchist politics (in his earlier work)

**Anarchist Assessment:** While these tendencies are far preferable to
Leninism or social democracy, they remain limited by trying to reconcile
irreconcilable elements. As Ron Tabor argues, "Marxism is a totalitarian
doctrine and every attempt to implement the Marxian program, no matter
how well-intentioned, will lead to the creation of authoritarian and
state-dominated societies."[^19]

The solution is not to reform Marxism but to abandon it for a
consistently anti-authoritarian approach based on federalism, direct
democracy, and workers' self-management - in short, anarchism.

## Anarchist Critique Summary

The anarchist critique of Marxism focuses on several key areas:

### The State

Anarchists reject Marx's belief that the working class can use the state
for liberation. The state, by its very nature as a centralized, coercive
institution, cannot be a tool for freedom. As
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> argued, "The state by its
very nature, cannot represent the people; it oppresses them."

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> documented how states throughout history have been
instruments of conquest, plunder, and exploitation, not progressive
forces. The modern state emerged through violence and subjugation, not
economic development.

### Centralization vs. Federalism

Marx's advocacy of economic and political centralization contradicts the
goal of a free society. Centralization means power concentrated at the
top, with the masses at the periphery. True socialism requires
federalism - free association of self-governing communities and
workplaces.

### Determinism vs. Freedom

Marx's deterministic philosophy (historical inevitability, iron laws of
history) leaves no room for human freedom and creativity. If socialism
is inevitable, then morality is irrelevant and freedom illusory.
Anarchists insist on human agency and moral choice.

### The Role of the Proletariat

Marx believed only the industrial proletariat in advanced capitalist
countries would make revolution. Anarchists recognized the revolutionary
potential of all oppressed people - peasants, artisans, unemployed,
marginalized communities. History proved anarchists right, as major
revolutions occurred in agrarian societies.

### Organization

Marx's "<a   href="democratic_centralism.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic centralism">"democratic centralism</a> and
"<a   href="vanguard_party.md" class="wikilink"
title="vanguard party">"vanguard party</a> model concentrates power in
party leaders who claim to represent workers. Anarchists advocate direct
democracy, voluntary federation, and rotating delegates with limited
mandates.

### Economic Analysis

While Marx's critique of capitalism has value, anarchists reject
economic determinism. Cultural, psychological, ethical, and political
factors shape history as much as economics. The anarchist
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> emphasized cooperation and
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
as evolutionary forces, not just competition and conflict.

## Conclusion

Marxism promised liberation but delivered tyranny. Its legacy includes:

- Totalitarian states that murdered millions
- Betrayal of working class struggles
- Absorption of socialist movements into capitalism
- Discrediting of socialism among broad populations

The failure stems not from "mistakes" or "betrayals" but from Marxism's
authoritarian core - its worship of the state, belief in centralization,
deterministic philosophy, and vanguardist organization.

Anarchism offers the genuine alternative: a society based on voluntary
cooperation, mutual aid, direct democracy, federalism, and workers'
self-management. Rather than seizing state power, anarchists seek to
abolish it. Rather than centralization, we advocate decentralized
federation. Rather than party dictatorship, we organize through
horizontal networks of workers' councils and popular assemblies.

As "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> wrote: "We want to
expropriate the property-owning class, and with violence, since it is
with violence that they hold onto social wealth and use it to exploit
the working class. Not because freedom is a good thing for the future,
but because it is a good thing, today as well as tomorrow, and the more
freedom there is, the better things will be."[^20]
