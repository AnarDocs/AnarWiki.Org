It must be stated that at the outset that the colonial “New England”
settlements were complicit in the dispossession and numerous massacres
of indigenous peoples' land. Moreover, participation in communal
decision-making was not extended to women, slaves, indentured servants,
teenagers, or men without property or income. With these huge caveats,
many anarchists have looked to the “New England” town meetings as a
example of (exclusionary but) horizontal self-governance.

Settling in Massachusetts Bay Colony in the late 1620s and 1630s, the
Puritans formed autonomous towns around their churches. Adult men with
property or income could participate at the regularly held
decision-making assemblies called town meetings. Constables had very
limited power to perform police functions, and communities instead
relied on decentralized sanctions such as disapproval and shunning.

# Culture

“The Puritans who settled colonial New England were neither willing nor
conscious bearers of the tradition of direct democracy,” writes the
social ecologist scholar Janet Biehl.[^1] The colonial culture was
highly conformist and patriarchal. In fact, according to the historian
Michael Zuckerman, one reason for the social cohesion of their
communities was that people were “disciplined from childhood against
dissent.”[^2]

People who were free on paper to fully participate in town meetings were
often more restricted in practice. Zuckerman explains, “\[M\]en might
have been free in principle to speak as they pleased, but they were
unlikely to exercise their legal prerogatives under the watchful eyes of
employers, ministers, and other officials who could give or withhold
essential assistance of many kinds. Most men could exercise the
privileges of citizenship, but since they were accustomed to bow before
their betters, the exercise was an empty one.”[^3]

# Decisions

Voting at town meetings in eighteenth-century “Massachusetts” was
restricted to property-owning men over twenty-one years old. The
qualification for property ownership was minimal, with the result that,
“If the democracy of adult males was something less than universal, it
was not ‘’very much’’ less.”[^4]

In each town, an elected selectboard facilitated the meetings. This
board handled administrative tasks, and the town meetings could veto the
selectmen’s proposals.[^5]

People at the meetings aimed for consensus or at least near consensus,
so that communal norms would be popularly followed and supported.
Violation of a rule decided at a meeting was thus considered an act of
significant deviance.[^6] The meetings generally did not seek to impose
controversial rules. Michael Zuckerman finds less than ten mentions of
debate in half a century of town meeting records in Massachusetts.[^7]

# Environment

The “New England” settlers rapidly killed wildlife and deforested the
region for agriculture and lumber. Colonists put a bounty on wolves and
organized collective hunts against them. Henry David Thoreau once
lamented the extermination of the region’s wildlife: “When I consider
that the nobler animals have been exterminated here,—the cougar,
panther, lynx, wolverine, wolf, bear, moose, deer, the beaver, the
turkey, etc., etc.,—I cannot but feel as if I lived in a tamed, and, as
it were, emasculated country.”[^8]

The colonists’ destruction of forests had serious consequences,
including floods and the drying of streams and springs. By the 1790s,
the lack of forest cover led to the quicker melting of snow. Because
this snow acted as a blanket for the soil, the faster melting caused the
soil to freeze to new depths. The frozen soil was unable to retain
groundwater of the melting snow, and consequently, there was more
flooding. Additionally, deforestation led to a faster runoff of water
since forests’ tree roots and unfrozen land had previously held spring
water in place.[^9]

# Crime

Decentralized sanctions were the main response to crime. Because town
meetings passed rules based on consensus or near consensus, violation
was deemed a serious social taboo. Members of a town threatened a
“withdrawal of fellowship” against people who committed crimes against
other residents.[^10]

Each eighteenth-century town in “Massachusetts” elected one or two
constables to perform police functions. The constables were heavily
accountable to communal opinion. Michael Zuckerman explains, “The
constables were effectively powerless when people refused to obey them.
The constables generally did not make unpopular arrests.”[^11] “Colonial
America, for example, had nothing like our modern police departments,”
writes Kristian Williams in ‘’Our Enemies in Blue: Police and Power in
America.’’.[^12]

Additionally, towns would require adult men to participate in a night
watch, during which time they would keep order, light street lamps, and
put out fires.[^13]
