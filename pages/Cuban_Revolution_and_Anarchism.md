Having been predominant in Cuba's labor movement, Anarchists
participated in the 1953-1959 Cuban Revolution before Stalinists such as
Fidel Castro and Che Guevara turned it into a state-capitalist
dictatorship. Finding their press censored and their organizations
repressed, Anarchists broke with the new Communist regime while
harboring a mixed assessment of the revolution's results. On one hand,
Anarchists found much to criticize as the new Communist republic flirted
with nuclear warfare and sent dissidents, homosexuals, and AIDS victims
to concentration camps. On the other hand, Anarchists opposed the United
States' embargo on Cuba and generally felt there were *some* major
successes in Cuba's efforts to seize partial self-reliance. Without high
levels of material wealth, Cuba has built an impressive universal health
care system. After the Soviet Union's 1989 collapse, Cuba lost its
shipments of Soviet oil and rapidly transitioned toward local,
decentralized, and sustainable agriculture.

# Before the Revolution

As the Castroite periodical *Cuba Socialista* admitted, "During the
whole epoch (from the 1890s until after the Russian Revolution) it was
the anarcho-syndicalists who led the class struggles in Cuba, and the
anarchist ideological influence that prevailed."[^1] Anarchist-leading
groups in this period included the Círculo de Trabajadores, the Sociedad
General de Trabajadores, and the Federación Obrera de la Habana.
Anarchists were among the few who openly protested the 1901 Platt
Amendment that invited the United States to militarily intervene at
basically any time.[^2]

# The Revolution

When the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista took dictatorial power in a 1952
coup, he faced opposition from the Left including the moderate
Auténticos and the more radical Ortodoxos. Fidel Castro and his
followers splintered from the Ortodoxos and launched a disastrous attack
on Cuba's second-largest army base on 26 July 1953. Even though half of
Castro's followers died during the battle, the attack attained symbolic
significance and became the namesake of Castro's subsequent 26th of July
Movement (M-26-7). In 1955, Batista granted Castro amnesty in an attempt
to win over moderates. Castro headed to Mexico where he met Che Guevara,
an Argentinian-born doctor and Communist bohemian who was travelling
through Latin America. Castro and Guevara raised funds and organized
military trainings in preparation for another attack on Batista's
regime.[^3]

While Castro and Guevara organized tiny guerrilla bands known as *foco*
in Cuba's Sierra Maestra mountain range, they probably would have been
quickly wiped out had it not been for masses of revolutionary Cubans
organizing in the cities and capturing the state's attention. "During
1957 and the first months of 1958, the cities continued to be the main
theater of the war between Batista and the opposition," Thomas Wright
assesses and he adds that without urban workers' and students' "repeated
demonstrations, strikes, assassination attempts, acts of sabotage, and
uprisings \[...\] Batista almost certainly would not have neglected
Castro, allowing his forces to grow and strengthen themselves."[^4] The
Anarchist writer Sam Dolgoff quotes K.S. Karol to the same effect:
"\[T\]he urban front was by far the most important and the
'guerilleros'...played a subordinate part. It was the cities which
supplied the 'guerilleros' with arms, money, information and
provisions."[^5] Even within the 26th of July Movement, "Castro did not
control the rank and file membership" according to Dolgoff.[^6]

Within the urban insurrections, Anarchist militants organized in the
Movimiento Libertario Cuba and they "elaborated a program of
self-managed agrarian reform, total municipal autonomy, and
industrialization through workers' associations."[^7] The Libertarian
Association of Cuba (ALC) had active chapters in Havana, Pinar del Rio,
San Cristobal, Artemisea, Ciego de Avila, and Manzanillo, and they had
followers scattered elsewhere as well. They took a leading role in
organizing proletarians and peasants into unions and producing radical
newspapers and radio programs. In Pinar de Rio, for example, ALC members
"influenced and participated in the leadership of the following unions:
tobacco workers, food workers, electricians, construction workers,
carpenters, transport workers, bank employees, and medical workers. The
magazines of the tobacco, bank workers, and electricans unions were
edited by libertarians."[^8]

Colin Ward reports the revolution temporarily created an anarchistic
situation[^9]:

> In Havana, when the general strike brought down the Batista regime and
> before Castro's army entered the city, a despatch from Robert Lyon,
> Executive Secretary of the New England office of the American Friends
> Service Committee reported that 'There are no police anywhere in the
> country, but the crime rate is lower than it has been in years,[^10]
> and the BBC's correspondent reported that 'The city for days had been
> without police of any sort, an experience delightful to everyone.
> Motorists - and considering that they were Cubans this was
> miraculous - behaved in an orderly manner. Industrial workers, with
> points to make, demonstrated in small groups, dispersed and went home;
> bars closed when the customers had had enough and no one seemed more
> than normally merry. Havana, heaving up after years under a vicious
> and corrupt police control, smiled in the hot sunshine.'[^11]

As the government spent its energies trying to suppress the Cuban
masses, Castro had "the great advantage of being virtually neglected"
according to Wright.[^12] During this time, the guerrilla forces trained
and grew. The *focos* were by necessity somewhat decentralized, but they
were neither democratic nor egalitarian. They were trained by Che
Guevara, whose manual on *Guerrilla Warfare* insisted that
"revolutionary democracy had never been applied in the running of armies
anywhere in the world, and that any attempt to implement it had ended in
disaster." The manual also proposed keeping women in “domestic tasks”
such as cooking and delivering messages. Guevara held the view that
guerrilla warfare was the right method basically anywhere and any time,
and this view ignored the critical importance of the urban mass revolts.
When Guevara later tried to implement his guerrilla methods in the
Congo, this time without popular support, the results were
disastrous.[^13]

On 1 January 1959, Castro's guerrillas captured Santa Clara, Cuba's
fourth largest city. Batista fled to the Dominican Republic, and
guerrillas triumphantly marched to Havana, the capital, and took state
power.[^14] The new regime systematically violated civil liberties,
following Guevara's hyper-collectivist insistence that "one has to
constantly think on behalf of masses and not on behalf of individuals."
While many of the 1960s' radicals and youth spoke out against being mere
"cogs in the machine," Guevara to the contrary asserted that the
individual "becomes happy to feel himself a cog in the wheel, a cog that
has its own characteristics and is necessary though not
indispensable."[^15] In his time in the mountains Guevara had executed
many guerrillas that he deemed "Informers, insubordinates, malingerers
and deserters." After taking state power, Guevara continued to support
the death penalty, and the regime's firing squad shot more than 550
people to death in just the first four months of 1959.[^16]

# State Capitalist Dictatorship

Castro's government was neither democratic nor socialist, as some of
Castro's supporters admitted in their moments of criticism. The regime's
supporter Herbert Matthews wrote that the new government was not a
democracy but rather an "autocracy" under Castro's control. René Dumont,
another pro-Castro author, admitted that Cuban workers "used to have a
capitalist boss, and now they have another boss...the State."[^17] With
the state largely controlling the economy, Cuba fit a definition of
*state capitalism* offered by *An Anarchist FAQ*: "the state replaces
the capitalist class totally via nationalisation of the means of
production. In such a regime, the state would own, manage and accumulate
capital rather than individual capitalists."[^18]

In fact, Fidel Castro told Mexican investors, “We are capitalists, but
state capitalists. We are not private capitalists.”[^19]

As a top-ranking minister, Guevara set up Cuba's first forced labor camp
and he described its prisoners as "people who have committed crimes
against revolutionary morals." Going forward, the government would send
dissidents, homosexuals, and AIDS victims to these concentration
camps.[^20] The government quickly cracked down on the Anarchists,
ordering their publications to close and throwing their ranks into
prisons. Some of the government's Anarchist political prisoners were
Plácido Mendez, Antonio Degas, Alberto Miguel Linsuain, Sondalio Torres,
José Acena, and Alberto Garcia.[^21]

The Cuban government was close to the Soviet Union and shared its
Marxist-Leninist ideology. In 1960, Guevara visited the Soviet Union and
laid flowers on Stalin's grave.[^22] This ideology reached nearly
apocalyptic proportions when Cuban authorities invited the Soviet Union
to use Cuba as a base for a nuclear standoff with the United States.
During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, a nuclear war very nearly
developed between the two dominant world powers when the USSR stationed
missiles in Cuba with the Castro regime's strong support, including
Guevara's.[^23] To Guevara's disappointment, the Soviets ended the
standoff by removing the missiles. The following passage by Larry
Gambone summarizes Guevara's attitude:

> After the Russians withdrew their rockets, ending the Cuban Missile
> Crisis of 1962, Che “fumed over the Soviet betrayal,” and told the
> Daily Worker (London) reporter “if the missiles had been under Cuban
> control, they would have fired them off.” The reporter “thought he was
> crackers from the way he went on about the missiles.” (p. 545) In 1965
> he demanded a revolutionary and apocalyptic world war, even if it
> unleashed the atomic bomb. “Thousands of people will die
> everywhere...But that should not worry us...” (emphasis added). Out of
> this mass destruction the new socialist order was supposed to
> arise.[^24]

Cuba is often condemned by human rights organizations for its repression
against dissidents. Human Rights Watch reported in 2017, "The Cuban
government continues to repress dissent and punish public criticism. It
now relies less than in past years on long-term prison sentences to
punish its critics, but short-term arbitrary arrests of human rights
defenders, independent journalists, and others have increased
dramatically in recent years. Other repressive tactics employed by the
government include beatings, public shaming, and termination of
employment."[^25]

After Black Panther member Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin fled to Cuba, "He was
met with hostility from the Cuban authorities, who imprisoned him amid
tensions between the Cuban government and other Black radicals who'd
fled there \[...\] His story can be placed alongside others, like the
Black revolutionary Robert F. Williams who also fled to Cuba and was met
with hostility from the Cuban authorities, who he said ultimately began
to 'sabotage' his liberation work."[^26]

In 2018, Cuban authorities detained
"<a   href="Earth_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a> militant
Joseph Dibee and sent him to the United States to be jailed and
prosecuted for alleged acts of ecologically-motivated sabotage including
the permanent destruction of a horse slaughtering facility.[^27] Dibee
says the Cuban government kept him more than two days without water or
shade to escape the Caribbean sunlight coming through the window.
Interrogators threatened him with “all sorts of tools” and warned they
might throw him into the ocean to drown. It should be remembered that
Dibee and the ELF have not been accused of committing violence against a
human being.[^28]

# Possible Successes

Despite the authoritarian, Stalinist excesses, the Cuban Revolution
arguably marked a small rupture in world capitalist hegemony and
improved the well-being of most residents and of the environment. In
2012, the Happy Planet Index, based on measures of health, happiness,
and environmental sustainability, ranked Cuba the 12th highest in the
world. By comparison, the United States was ranked 104th.[^29]

Anarchists tend to praise Cuba's successes while simultaneously
condemning its abuses and atrocities. Peter Gelderloos writes, "\[I\]n
terms of structural depravity and state repression, Castro’s Cuba, the
product of a violent revolution, is arguably less violent than Batista’s
Cuba. However, there are already enough apologists for Castro as to
disincline me from expending my energies in such a manner."[^30] Andrew
R Smolski, Alexander Reid Ross, and Javier Sethness Castro speculate
that Cuba has "a certain exilic-incorporative relationship to the
world-system" with "definitive mutual aid interactions among the
population" while "there still exist class differentiations and a
non-democratic political structure."[^31]

Cuba's socialized health care system functions smoothly considering the
society's limited resources and the devastating effects of the United
States' decades-long embargo. The World Health Organization in 2000
ranked Cuba's health care system as the 39th best in the world. Cuba was
only two spots below the United States, even though Cuba is a
third-world country and the United States is the most powerful country
in the world.[^32] Noam Chomsky also reports that "a detailed study by
the American Association for World Health concluded that the embargo had
severe health effects, and only Cuba’s remarkable health care system had
prevented a 'humanitarian catastrophe'; this has received virtually no
mention in the US."[^33]

After the Soviet Union's 1989 collapse, Cuba rapidly shifted toward
decentralized local agriculture, as Gelderloos summarizes:

> In Cuba, centralized industrial agriculture collapsed after the fall
> of the Soviet Bloc, which had been Cuba’s main supplier of petroleum
> and machinery. The subsequent tightening of the US embargo only
> exacerbated the situation. The average Cuban lost 20 pounds. Quickly,
> much of the country shifted to small-scale intensive urban
> agriculture. As of 2005, half of the fresh produce consumed by the 2
> million residents of Havana was produced by about 22,000 urban
> gardeners within the city itself.[^34]

The government owns 80 percent of arable rural land, and it leases about
half this land to farmers on ten-year terms. There are widespread
experiments with organic farming methods that get the most food out of
small areas of farmland while preserving the health of the soils. Bill
Weinberg describes an organic farm he visited called Finca
Agro-Ecológica El Paraíso—Paradise Agro-Ecological Farm:

> \[The farm's owner Wilfredo García Correa\] showed me the operations
> in *lumbricultura*—vermiculture, breaking down organic waste into
> humus with earthworms. Fat rabbits munched leaves in suspended cages,
> their droppings collected below to fertilize the beds that grow more
> greens for both rabbit and human consumption. Eventually the rabbits
> themselves are also eaten. "It's a completely closed system," García
> said.
>
> Nearby, he reached into a honeycomb with his knife to scrape out a
> taste for me—produced by a local variety of bee, the melipona, that
> does not sting.
>
> He indicated the pest-control methods perfected through years of
> experimentation. Different colored flowers are planted to attract
> insects, then coated with grease to trap them, or treated with
> tabacina—water infused with tobacco, fatal to the pests but harmless
> to the plants. Rotation and intercropping helps maintain soil
> fertility.

Bikes and bike-pulled taxi carriages, are ubiquitously used instead of
cars. Urban, organic gardens produce much local food for city dwellers.
Fruit and vegetable stands are found every few blocks in Central Havana.
As Cuba began taking oil shipments from Venezuela and as U.S. President
Obama restored diplomacy in 2015, Cuba's increasing integration into the
global market has left uncertain the future of its low-carbon
initiatives.[^35]
