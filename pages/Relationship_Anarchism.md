# Relationship Anarchy

## Overview

**Relationship Anarchy** (often abbreviated as **RA**) is the
application of anarchist principles to intimate and interpersonal
relationships. It challenges the normative structures, hierarchies, and
expectations that typically govern how people relate to one another,
particularly in romantic and sexual contexts. Rather than prescribing a
specific relationship form, relationship anarchy emphasizes autonomy,
voluntary association, non-hierarchy, and the customization of each
relationship according to the needs and desires of those involved.[^1]

Relationship anarchy explicitly rejects both
"<a   href="amatonormativity.md" class="wikilink"
title="amatonormativity">"amatonormativity</a> (the assumption that
romantic relationships are superior to other forms) and
"<a   href="mononormativity.md" class="wikilink"
title="mononormativity">"mononormativity</a> (the assumption that
monogamy is the default or ideal relationship structure). It is
commonly, though not always, practiced in non-monogamous contexts.
However, RA differs significantly from
"<a   href="polyamory.md" class="wikilink" title="polyamory">"polyamory</a> and
other forms of non-monogamy in that it rejects predetermined
relationship hierarchies, rules, and agreements that restrict individual
autonomy.[^2]

Within anarchist thought, there is no single preferred relationship
form. While some anarchists embrace relationship anarchy as most
consistent with principles of autonomy and voluntary association, others
practice various relationship structures including monogamy, polyamory,
or celibacy. What unites anarchist approaches to relationships is a
rejection of state and religious control over intimate life, opposition
to oppressive gender norms, and commitment to freely chosen association.

## Origins

Historical anarchist thinkers including
"<a   href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">"William
Godwin</a>, "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>, and
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a> wrote critically about traditional marriage and relationship
structures, viewing them as institutions of property, control, and
patriarchal domination. These early anarchists advocated for
"<a   href="free_love.md" class="wikilink" title="free love">"free love</a> -
the idea that intimate relationships should be based on mutual desire
and respect rather than legal, religious, or social coercion.

The contemporary concept of relationship anarchy emerged from queer and
countercultural communities in the early 2000s. The term was popularized
by Swedish activist Andie Nordgren, who published "Relationsanarki i 8
punkter" (Relationship anarchy in 8 points) in Swedish in 2006, later
translated and expanded as "The short instructional manifesto for
relationship anarchy" in 2012.[^3]

Nordgren developed relationship anarchy partly in response to
limitations she perceived within the polyamory movement. While polyamory
challenged monogamy, many polyamorous practices still maintained
hierarchies (primary/secondary partners), rules about what partners
could do with others, and assumptions that romantic relationships were
more important than friendships. Nordgren wrote that in the early
polyamory community, "love was somehow both special and dangerous. Those
who entered the cage willingly would both be subject to control by the
other(s), as well as be forced to exercise control over the other(s)
behaviour."[^4]

Other early explorations of similar ideas include "A Green Anarchist
Project on Freedom and Love" by Mae Bee (2004) and various discussions
in anarchist and queer communities about challenging couple privilege
and relationship norms.

## Core Principles

Relationship anarchy is grounded in several interconnected principles
drawn from anarchist philosophy:

### Autonomy and Self-Determination

Each individual maintains sovereignty over their own life, body, and
choices. No one has the right to control another person's relationships,
activities, or associations. This means rejecting possessiveness and
ownership models of relationships. As Mx. Flow explains, "Relationship
Anarchism means renouncing domination over those we care about, it means
the people we care about should be allowed to genuinely be themselves
and not who we want them to be."[^5]

### Anti-Hierarchy

Relationship anarchy rejects the idea that certain relationships should
be inherently prioritized over others. It challenges the normative
hierarchy that places romantic partnerships above friendships, or
"primary" partners above "secondary" ones. Each relationship is valued
for its unique qualities rather than ranked against others. This does
not mean all relationships will be equally close or time-intensive, but
that hierarchies are not imposed through rules or social
expectations.[^6]

### Customization Over Convention

Rather than following predetermined scripts for how relationships
"should" develop (the "relationship escalator" of dating, exclusivity,
cohabitation, marriage, children), relationship anarchists design each
relationship based on the specific desires, needs, and circumstances of
those involved. Nordgren emphasizes: "Don't rank and compare people and
relationships – cherish the individual and your connection to them."[^7]

### Free Association

Drawing directly from anarchist political theory, relationship anarchy
upholds the principle that people should be free to associate with
whomever they choose, in whatever ways they mutually agree upon. This
includes the freedom to begin, modify, or end relationships without
external coercion. As described in anarchist philosophy more broadly,
"People should be free to cooperate with whomever they want, however
they see fit; likewise, they should be free to refuse any relationship
or arrangement they do not judge to be in their interest."[^8]

### Communication and Consent

Because relationship anarchy rejects default social scripts, it requires
explicit communication about needs, boundaries, and desires. Nordgren
writes: "Radical relationships must have conversation and communication
at the heart — not as a state of emergency only brought out to solve
'problems.' Communicate in a context of trust."[^9]

### Mutual Aid

Relationships should be grounded in reciprocal support and care rather
than obligation or entitlement. This anarchist principle emphasizes that
healthy relationships involve a flow of emotional, practical, and social
support, while recognizing that perfect balance is neither possible nor
necessary at every moment.

## Relationship to Anarchist Politics

Relationship anarchy connects personal relationship practices to broader
anarchist politics in several ways:

### Challenging the State and Patriarchy

Traditional relationship structures, particularly marriage, have
historically functioned as mechanisms of state control, property
transfer, and patriarchal domination. Marriage laws regulate who can
form relationships, grant economic privileges to certain relationship
forms, and have been used to control women's sexuality, autonomy, and
economic independence. Relationship anarchy challenges these structures
by refusing to seek state validation for relationships and rejecting
patriarchal relationship norms.

### Prefigurative Politics

Many anarchists view relationship anarchy as a form of
"<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a> - creating the
world we want to see through our present actions. By practicing
non-hierarchical, autonomous relationships now, relationship anarchists
embody anarchist values in their daily lives. As R. Foxtale notes,
"Relationship Anarchy is a politic and, as both politic and practice,
it's actively anti-monogamy, anti-marriage, and
anti-contracts/rules/policing."[^10]

### Intersectionality

Relationship anarchy emerged from and remains connected to queer,
feminist, and anti-racist movements. It challenges
"<a   href="heteronormativity.md" class="wikilink"
title="heteronormativity">"heteronormativity</a>, the
"<a   href="nuclear_family.md" class="wikilink" title="nuclear family">"nuclear
family</a> as the default social unit, and relationship norms that serve
capitalist economic structures (such as the privatization of care work
within nuclear families). Roma De las Heras Gómez explores relationship
anarchy from a queer feminist perspective, examining how it challenges
multiple intersecting systems of oppression.[^11]

### Beyond Couple-Centrism

Relationship anarchy challenges the isolation of the nuclear family and
couple-centric models of intimacy. By valuing diverse forms of
connection and building interdependent community networks, RA offers an
alternative to both capitalist individualism and traditional family
structures. This aligns with anarchist visions of society organized
around voluntary communities rather than state-enforced family units.

## Relationship Anarchy in Practice

### The Relationship Smorgasbord

One practical tool developed within relationship anarchy communities is
the "Relationship Anarchist Smorgasbord," which maps various dimensions
of intimacy and connection that can be customized for each relationship.
These might include emotional intimacy, physical affection, sexuality,
cohabitation, financial entanglement, co-parenting, and many other
facets. Rather than assuming a predetermined package of elements, each
relationship can include whatever combination makes sense for those
involved.

### Deconstructing Categories

Relationship anarchists often resist traditional relationship labels
like "boyfriend," "girlfriend," or "partner," which can impose
expectations and obscure the unique nature of each connection. Instead,
they may describe relationships in terms of actual activities, feelings,
and commitments. For example, rather than saying "my partner," one might
say "someone I live with, have sex with, and share finances with." This
specificity prevents assumptions and allows relationships to exist
outside predetermined categories.

### Communication Practices

Without default social scripts, relationship anarchists must actively
communicate about boundaries, desires, and expectations. This includes
discussing topics that might be assumed in conventional relationships,
such as: What kinds of physical affection are desired? What information
do people want to know about each other's other relationships? How do
people want to support each other during difficult times? What
commitments, if any, are people making to one another?

### Networks Rather Than Dyads

Rather than organizing life around one or two primary relationships,
many relationship anarchists cultivate broad networks of meaningful
connections. This might include people they live with, people they
parent with, various intimate partners, close friends, and community
members - none necessarily ranked in importance. These networks can
provide more resilient support than dyadic couples, as care and
resources flow through multiple connections rather than being
concentrated in one relationship.

## Relationship to Other Forms of Non-Monogamy

### Polyamory

While relationship anarchy is sometimes practiced within polyamorous
contexts, the two are distinct. Polyamory refers to having multiple
romantic or sexual partners, often with structured agreements,
hierarchies (primary/secondary partners), and relationship rules.
Relationship anarchy can include multiple intimate connections but
explicitly rejects hierarchies and rules about what partners can
do.[^12]

Many polyamorous practices that relationship anarchists critique
include:

- Requiring a partner's "permission" or "approval" before pursuing new
  connections
- Establishing hierarchies where some partners have more rights or
  priority than others
- Creating rules about what sexual or intimate activities are allowed
  with different partners
- Practicing "polyfidelity" where a closed group of people can only be
  intimate with each other

### Monogamy

Relationship anarchy is compatible with choosing to be intimate with one
person, but incompatible with requiring that someone else be monogamous
or treating monogamy as morally superior. Moen and Sørlie argue that
monogamy requirements function as "exclusivity requirements" that grant
one person monopoly control over another's sexuality and intimacy. They
write: "if exclusivity requirements are not okay in the case of
friendships, why are they okay in the case of romantic
relationships?"[^13]

Some relationship anarchists practice what might externally appear as
monogamy - choosing to have one intimate partner - but reject the
ideology of compulsory monogamy and maintain that their partner is free
to make their own choices.

### Solo Polyamory

Solo polyamory, where individuals prioritize their autonomy and do not
seek to establish traditional couple relationships, shares some overlap
with relationship anarchy in its emphasis on independence. However, solo
poly may still involve hierarchies and rules, whereas RA explicitly
rejects these structures.

## Debates and Criticisms

### Within Anarchist Thought

Not all anarchists embrace relationship anarchy. Some concerns raised
include:

**Emotional Development**: Some argue that long-term committed
relationships (including monogamous ones) provide important
opportunities for emotional growth, learning to navigate conflict, and
developing deep intimacy. They worry that relationship anarchy's
emphasis on autonomy might discourage the vulnerability and compromise
necessary for profound connection.

**Practical Constraints**: Critics note that radical relationship
autonomy requires significant material resources - time, energy,
emotional capacity, and often money for separate housing, childcare, and
other support. Those facing economic precarity, disability, or intensive
caregiving responsibilities may find RA ideals inaccessible.

**Children and Dependents**: Questions arise about how relationship
anarchy applies to relationships with children or other dependents who
cannot consent to relationship structures and who require stable
caregiving. While RA doesn't preclude parenting, the emphasis on
individual autonomy must be balanced with children's needs for security
and consistency.

**Privilege**: Some anarchists argue that relationship anarchy can
reflect privilege - particularly regarding who has the social, economic,
and emotional resources to maintain multiple complex relationships
without defaulting to established social structures for support.

### The "Cheating" Question

One of the most contentious aspects of relationship anarchy is its
stance on agreements and "cheating." Some RA advocates, like R. Foxtale,
argue that relationship anarchy means rejecting all relationship
agreements that restrict a partner's autonomy, including refusing to
participate in policing others' relationship rules. Foxtale states: "As
a relationship anarchist, I very well might steal your partner, because
I believe the idea partners can be 'stolen' is not only nonsense, but
oppressive nonsense."[^14]

This position is controversial even among anarchists who support
non-monogamy. Critics argue that:

- Encouraging people to break agreements undermines trust and causes
  harm
- There's a difference between rejecting unjust agreements and actively
  undermining all agreements
- True autonomy includes the freedom to make commitments
- This approach can justify manipulative behavior

Defenders respond that:

- The concept of "cheating" assumes one person has the right to control
  another's choices
- Many relationship agreements are coercive, made under conditions of
  unequal power
- RA doesn't require anyone to pursue relationships with those in
  restrictive agreements, but objects to treating such agreements as
  morally binding third parties

### Jealousy and Compersion

Critics of relationship anarchy sometimes invoke jealousy as evidence
that humans "naturally" require exclusivity. RA advocates respond that
jealousy is largely socially constructed and intensified by cultural
narratives about ownership and scarcity in love. They note that jealousy
is common even in monogamous relationships, suggesting that exclusivity
doesn't eliminate it. Moen and Sørlie argue that "monogamy norms
perpetuate jealousy" because they create conditions where potential
intimate partners are indeed threats to existing relationships.[^15]

Some relationship anarchists cultivate "compersion" - taking joy in a
partner's joy with others - as an alternative to jealousy. Critics worry
this places unfair emotional demands on people and dismisses legitimate
feelings of insecurity or hurt.

### Stability and Community

Questions arise about whether relationship anarchy can provide the
long-term stability necessary for certain goals like raising children,
caring for elders, or building lasting community institutions. Defenders
argue that distributed networks of care may actually be more stable than
brittle dyadic couples, citing evidence that the nuclear family is a
recent and often failing experiment. They also note that RA doesn't
prohibit long-term commitments - it simply insists these should be
freely chosen and customized rather than imposed by social norms.

## Relationship Anarchy and Capitalism

The relationship between RA and capitalist economic structures is
complex. Some anarchists argue that relationship anarchy presumes and
requires capitalist material conditions - particularly the ability to
maintain separate housing, have multiple intimate relationships without
depending on any one partner economically, and access to commodified
care services (childcare, eldercare, food services, etc.).

Others contend that relationship anarchy actually challenges capitalist
atomization by building interdependent community networks and refusing
to privatize care within isolated nuclear family units. They argue that
the nuclear family serves capitalism by making workers individually
responsible for their own social reproduction, while broader
relationship networks could facilitate collective care and resistance.

The practice of relationship anarchy under current conditions often
requires navigating these contradictions - using individual resources to
create space for non-normative relationships while working toward more
collective forms of support and resistance.

## Current Practice and Communities

Relationship anarchy is practiced primarily within queer, feminist, and
countercultural communities, particularly in urban areas with
established anarchist and LGBTQ+ scenes. Online communities have also
formed around RA principles, sharing experiences and resources.

Academic interest in relationship anarchy has grown, with scholars
examining it from sociological, philosophical, and gender studies
perspectives. The topic has been featured in major media outlets, though
often sensationalized or misunderstood.

Some relationship anarchists are working to connect RA principles to
other forms of anarchist organizing, exploring how communities might
support diverse relationship structures through collective childcare,
housing cooperatives, and mutual aid networks. Others focus on personal
practice, viewing RA as primarily about individual liberation from
oppressive relationship norms.

## Conclusion

Relationship anarchy represents one contemporary application of
anarchist principles to intimate life, emphasizing autonomy, voluntary
association, and the rejection of hierarchical relationship structures.
While not embraced by all anarchists, it offers a framework for thinking
critically about how social norms, state institutions, and capitalist
economic structures shape our most intimate connections.

The diversity of perspectives within anarchist communities - including
those who practice relationship anarchy, those who choose other
relationship forms, and those who critique RA - reflects anarchism's
broader commitment to free experimentation and resistance to dogma. What
unites these perspectives is a rejection of state and religious control
over intimate life and a commitment to building relationships based on
freedom, equality, and mutual aid rather than coercion, tradition, or
social expectation.

As relationship anarchy continues to develop, key questions remain about
how to balance individual autonomy with collective care, how to practice
RA ethically across lines of power and privilege, and how relationship
structures can support both personal liberation and broader social
transformation.
