The San are a cluster of indigenous peoples who live in southern Africa,
speak a click language, and have a hunter-gatherer tradition rooted in
statelessness and gender and age egalitarianism. Most San are no longer
foragers and have seen their cultures largely eroded by state
discrimination and "modernization" programs. Still, many San
communities, including amongst the Ju/'hoansi, !Kung, Kua, and Nharo in
Botswana, continue to struggle for cultural survival as foragers.

# Culture

The main values of San culture are equality and sharing. In addition,
individual autonomy is highly valued.[^1]

## Village Setup

The village's circular setup, with huts and fireplaces surrounding a
central plaza,[^2] is reminiscent of other egalitarian cultures
including the "<a   href="Cucuteni–Trypillia_civilization.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cucuteni–Trypillia civilization">"Cucuteni–Trypillia
civilization</a> and Canela peoples.

## Gender and Sexuality

Anthropologists have observed gender equality in terms of status and
labor. According to Richard E. Lee, an anthropologist who did field
research among the !Kung and regularly visited them from the 1960s into
the twenty-first century, there is "relative equality between the sexes,
with no one having the upper hand."[^3] By Lee's estimate, men and women
did roughly the same amount of work.[^4] The anthropologist Patricia
Draper notes that despite a gendered division of labor, "In practice,
adults of both sexes seem surprisingly willing to do the work of the
opposite sex. It often appeared to me that men, more than women, were
willing to cross sex lines."[^5] Women, as providers of roughly 60 to 80
percent of daily food intake, derived enormous self-esteem from their
contribution, according to Draper, who observes that in general, "!Kung
women are vivacious and self-confident."[^6]

Although Lee reported that homosexuality and lesbianism were uncommon,
he also noted that practitioners were not met with any hostility. He
described no restrictions on consensual sexuality, and most !Kung had
some experience with intercourse by the age of fifteen.[^7] Parents
arranged each child's first marriage, although they would invariably
call the marriage off if the child protested enough. Married couples
could freely divorce, and divorces were "characterized by a high degree
of cordiality, at least compared with Western norms."[^8]

## Children

Children are not trained to respect authority, and the closest that a
parent will come to punishing them is "to interrupt the misbehavior,
carry the child away, and try to interest him or her in some inoffensive
activity," according to Draper.[^9] Harold Barclay summarizes
traditional San approaches to childraising: "Children are treated
permissively by parents. Marshall affirms the latter are especially fond
of younger children and gentle in their treatment of them."[^10]
Children regularly play with others of the opposite sex and of very
different ages.[^11]

Childcare is a communal activity. A !Kung infant is estimated to be held
by an allomother (not the biological mother) about 25% of the time.[^12]

## Religion

San religion, if it can even be called religion, has a trickster as its
main deity. The trickster can turn into human or animal form, having no
consistent gender but usually appearing as male when appearing on Earth.
San people do not generally fear the trickster god but instead laugh and
joke about him.

For example, a Nharo tale features a female snake getting her revenge on
the trickster Pate, causing the Kalahari's riverbeds and water holes:

> "Pate walked and he saw a puffadder. She was sleeping as a hole in the
> sand with her young ones. He went over to the hole. He jumped over it
> and defecated on the puffadder and her young ones. He did this over
> and over again, until the puffadder thought she would teach him a
> lesson.
>
> And so when Pate came the next time and when he jumped, the puffadder
> bit him in the balls. They swelled up to a tremendous size, the size
> of boulders.
>
> Pate was in terrible pain and he ran all over the country digging
> holes to relieve his pain (by cooling his testicles). This is how
> every hole in the ground, the pans, rivers, caves and little
> depressions, were formed."[^13]

The Ju/wasi tell stories mocking ≠Gao N!a, the Creator of all the earth,
animals, and plants. He is often pranked by his wives and relatives. In
one story:

> "he is tricked so that he jumps into a hidden pit filled with
> feces—also the work of his wives. Again and again, he is battered and
> humiliated, but he never catches on. Every time his wives or his
> kinsmen tell him some whopper, he believes them, to his sorrow. (Look,
> a baby eland, can you see him? No, I can’t. He’s under those leaves,
> so jump right there and you’ll catch him. Really? Yes, but hurry, he’s
> escaping!) Soon the great god is dragging himself, befouled, from the
> pit full of feces, while in the distance, bitterly, he hears the
> laughter of his wives."[^14]

Another tale, from the Kua, involves a woman cutting off the testicles
of a male trickster god who tried to rape her. In this myth, the creator
was attracted to a young woman who was out on a gathering expedition. He
materialized as a man, the size of a preying mantis at first, and ate
nuts, berries and onions and grew and grew as he ate. After several
hours, he was very tired, and he climbed into the woman's sack of
vegetables. Back at camp, God grew to a normal human size and tried to
rape the woman. She cut off his testicles with a knife, killing him. As
the testicles bounced away, the woman summoned a swarm of bees to chase
and sting them. Seed feel out where the bees stung them. Although the
testicles buried themselves in the sand and died, the seed grew into
truffles, a delicacy of Kalahari cuisine.[^15]

A central part of San religious experience is dancing and singing. About
one half of men and one third of women are able to enter a trance during
these activities.[^16]

## Afterlife

Unlike other African foragers (such as the
"<a   href="Mbuti.md" class="wikilink" title="Mbuti">"Mbuti</a>,
"<a   href="Hadza.md" class="wikilink" title="Hadza">"Hadza</a>, and
"<a   href="Bayaka.md" class="wikilink" title="Bayaka">"Bayaka</a>), the !Kung
believe in an afterlife.[^17]

## Science

The U.S. astronomer Carl Sagan described traditional !Kung hunters'
tracking techniques as "science in action." Looking at an animal's
footprint, the hunters would deduce how long ago the animal was there.
for example, when they saw tracks near trees they would estimate how
long ago the shadow of the trees would have provided shade where the
tracks lay. Sagan noted, "This calculation will be different in
different seasons of the year. So the hunters must carry in their heads
a kind of astronomical calendar predicting the apparent solar
motion."[^18]

# Decisions

The San peoples had no chiefs or other headmen. K"au, a San man, told
Lee, "We had no one set apart like a chief; we all lived on the
land."[^19] Put another way, /Twi!gum, another San man, told Lee, "Of
course we have headmen! In fact, we are all headmen. Each one of us is
headman over himself!"[^20]

Some within the camp, including those considered the "owners" of each
territory, did have a disproportionate influence, but they lacked the
authority to command others. Lee wrote, "These leaders work in subtle
ways; they are modest in demeanour and may never command, but only
suggest, a course of action."[^21]

# Economy

San foragers' economy is gift-based and communistic economy.

Some 69% of items that Ju’hoansi used were transitory (passed on as a
gift to someone else).[^22]

!Kung foragers have a gift economy and practiced communal control of the
land. The gift-giving system is called *hxaro*, and it was the major
"means of maintaining and fostering amicable relations between
groups."[^23] Each camp's territory is called a *n!ore*, and it is
collectively manged by the "owners" or *k"ausi*. People wishing to camp
or use a territory had to ask permission from the "owners," but
permission was rarely denied. Each member of a !Kung society had the
ownership rights to the the territories of each of their parents. [^24]

Food is traditionally obtained through gathering and hunting, and Lee
measured in 1964 that it took the !Kung about twenty hours over two and
a half days to get a week's worth of food. Lee remarked, "the !Kung in
fact enjoyed a rather good diet \[and\] they didn't have to work very
hard to get it."[^25] Sahlins describes the !Kung as "affluent society"
who had enough to eat and drink and more than enough materials to make
everything else, from shelter to tools.[^26]

Including hunting, gathering, tool-making, and housework, Lee measured
that each !Kung man worked an average of 44.5 hours a week and each
!Kung woman worked an average of 40.1 hours. By comparison, Lee wrote,
"Studies have shown that North American wage-earners, those with many
children especially, will spend up to 40 hours per week *over and above
their wage-paid* job doing housework, shopping, washing, etc."[^27]

When a hunter brought meat back to the band, the meat would go to the
owner of the arrow that pierced the animal. This person, not the hunter,
had responsibility for distributing the meat. Often, the owner of the
arrow was a woman. This way, the !Kung kept a roughly egalitarian
distribution of food even when some men were better hunters than
others.[^28] Moreover, the people eating the game would go out of their
way to "insult the meat" in order to keep the hunters' ego in
check.[^29]

Each !Kung family fed and cared for its elders. The elders, in turn,
considered such care a right and never apologized for being a burden.
Lee found that frail elders each had four to eight caretakers.[^30]

# Crime

When two !Kung men fought each other, often over a woman, others moved
to physically separate the fighters. Humor often diffused tension, Lee
observed: "Serious as they appear at the time, anger quickly turns to
laughter in \[!Kung\] fights. We have seen partisans joking with each
other when only a few minutes before they were grappling."[^31] Some
fights involved no weapons, and others involved the deadly use of
poisoned darts.

As a last-resort measure to stop a series of homicide, the !Kung
occasionally would execute a responsible party. Lee quotes a !Kung man's
account of one execution: "One evening Debe walked right into Gau's camp
and without saying a word shot three arrows into Gau...Gau's people made
no move to protect him."[^32]

Lee reported that rape among the !Kung was "extremely uncommon."[^33]

# Environment

The San have lived sustainably for many millennia without destroying
their landbase, as evident in the way Richard Lee describes the Kalahari
Desert: "Wildlife was abundant. Antelope and warthog tracks were
everywhere, as well as leopard and hyena. At night, lions could be heard
grunting to each other as they fed on their kills."[^34]

According to Lee, the !Kung view the bush, or *t'si* outside their camps
"as wilderness," though they don't build walls to separate the village
from bush.[^35]
