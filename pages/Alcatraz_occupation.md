In November 1969, eighty-nine indigenous people, calling themselves
"Indians of All Tribes," occupied Alcatraz Island, the former site of a
maximum security prison in the San Francisco Bay. They reported that the
1868 Fort Laramie Treaty promised the Oceti Sakowin (Sioux) out-of-use
federal lands and that therefore the Oceti Sakowin had a right to claim
it. The siege lasted nineteen months and had hundreds of occupiers at
its peak. The Indians of All Tribes wanted to turn the site into a
cultural center with a college and museum. They used the occupation to
attract international attention to their grievances and demands. They
offered to buy the site for \$24 in beads and cloth, which is what
settlers paid Indians for Manhattan. They said that the former prison
site would make a perfect Indian reservation since it had lacked fresh
water, fertile land, employment, and health care facilities.[^1]

In the early months, hundreds of indigenous people joined the occupation
and organized "a school that taught indigenous history and culture from
their own perspective, without the racist propaganda that filled the
textbooks of the government's schools."[^2] Members of the American
Indian Movement participated in the occupation.[^3]

In the spring of 1970, the government cut off water and electricity. The
number of occupiers declined, as did media attention. The government
removed the last fifteen occupiers in June 1971.[^4]

The occupation had a profound impact on indigenous politics and on the
American counterculture. Cherokee chief Wilma Mankiller visited the
occupation many times and remarked: "For the first time, people were
saying things I felt but hadn't known how to articulate. It was very
liberating." Historian Colin Calloway writes, "The protests there
brought Indians and their grievances to the attention of the world.
Alcatraz served as a warning for the United States that Indian rights
could no longer be ignored and became a symbol of hope for Indian people
who realized that they need no longer suffer in silence."[^5]

Klee Benally mentions some problems with the Alcatraz occupation:

> The occupation of Alcatraz had its share of issues; the tragic
> accidental death of Yvonne Oakes who was just 13-years-old, prevalent
> substance use, internal gendered power struggles, a suspicious fire,
> limited resources such as water and electricity on the island,
> diminishing public support, and the Ohlone (the original Indigenous
> Peoples of the area) had formally denounced the action.[^6]
