# Morelos Commune

The **Morelos Commune** (Spanish: *Comuna de Morelos*) was the political
and economic system established in the Mexican state of
"<a   href="Morelos.md" class="wikilink" title="Morelos">Morelos</a> between
1913 and 1917. Led by "<a   href="Emiliano_Zapata.md" class="wikilink"
title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a>, the people of Morelos
implemented a series of wide-reaching social reforms based on the
proposals laid out in the
"<a   href="Plan_of_Ayala.md" class="wikilink" title="Plan of Ayala">Plan of
Ayala</a>. The term "Morelos Commune" was coined by the Mexican
historian
"<a   href="Adolfo_Gilly.md" class="wikilink" title="Adolfo Gilly">Adolfo

"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> of 1871.[^1][^2]

## Background

The native institutions of Morelos traced their ancestry back to the
time of the
"<a   href="Aztec_Empire.md" class="wikilink" title="Aztec Empire">Aztec
Empire</a>, before the Spanish conquest of the Americas. The local Nahua
people held the land in the region under
"<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a>, which guaranteed them
autonomy and self-sufficiency.[^3]

During the 19th century, the sugar industry in Morelos grew increasingly
profitable, as foreign demand for the product expanded and new
technologies eased production and distribution. In order to grow the
Mexican economy, the regime of
"<a   href="Porfirio_Díaz.md" class="wikilink" title="Porfirio Díaz">Porfirio
Díaz</a> oversaw a mass concentration of land ownership into
"<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a>, reducing the amount of
common land in the country to only 2% of arable land. The state of
Morelos, where much of the country's sugar industry was concentrated,
was among the hardest hit by this policy. Only 23.7% of land in Morelos
managed to remain outside the private ownership of a *hacienda*.[^4]

Lands previously held under common ownership were taken over by
*haciendas*, which extracted increasingly high profits from the sugar
crop, with many of the state's peasants becoming landless. The people of
Morelos attempted to resist the seizure of common land through judicial
means, but the privatization of land only accelerated. Sugar production
increased dramatically with the privatization of land, forcing peasants
onto the large estates as agricultural labourers. Morelos' peasants were
forced to work for the *haciendas* year-round and were only provided
with earthen floor huts for accommodation, keeping them in

## History

### Revolution

The "<a   href="Mexican_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> broke out in 1910, as
several different rebel groups under the leadership of Francisco Madero
rose up against the established order of the *Porfiriato*. When the
Porifirian sugar estates collapsed, leaving no alternative means of
subsistence for their workers, Madero's promises of
"<a   href="agrarian_reform.md" class="wikilink"
title="agrarian reform">agrarian reform</a> won over the peasant leader
"<a   href="Emiliano_Zapata.md" class="wikilink"
title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a>, who organised the sugar
workers of Morelos to attack the *haciendas* and seize the land for
their communities.[^6]

This series of expropriations of privately-owned land by armed peasants
led to the establishment of the
"<a   href="Liberation_Army_of_the_South.md" class="wikilink"
title="Liberation Army of the South">Liberation Army of the South</a>
(ELS), which spearheaded the revolutionary uprising in Morelos. On 20
May 1911, the ELS captured Cuautla, and on 21 May, they captured the
state capital of Cuernavaca.[^7]

By the time that Porfirio Díaz was ousted and Madero became President of
Mexico, the revolutionary forces had completely taken over the state of
Morelos. President Madero soon went back on his promises of agrarian
reform and ordered the Zapatistas to disarm. On 25 November 1911, Zapata
responded by issuing the
"<a   href="Plan_of_Ayala.md" class="wikilink" title="Plan of Ayala">Plan of
Ayala</a>, in which he called for the autonomy of Morelos and the
immediate redistribution of land from the *haciendas* to the
peasantry.[^8]

### Establishment of the Commune

By December 1914, a power vacuum had opened up in Mexico, which was left
without any centralized government. At that time, Mexico City was
occupied by Villa and the Zapatistas, the latter of whom desired to
"burn the \[presidential\] chair to end ambitions".[^9]

On 9 December 1914, Zapata's Liberation Army of the South left the
capital for their home state of Morelos, where they established a
"<a   href="self-governance.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-governing">self-governing</a> and egalitarian
"<a   href="society.md" class="wikilink" title="society">society</a>. The
Morelos Commune was influenced by local indigenous practices of
self-management as well as "<a   href="agrarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="agrarian socialism">agrarian socialism</a>,
"<a   href="Magonism.md" class="wikilink" title="Magonism">Magonism</a>, and
"<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a>.[^10][^11]

The movement was based on land reform through agrarian communalism in a
way that was "antagonistic…to capitalism and its inherent need for the
sanctity of private property".[^12] The Ayala Plan, a main document of
the Morelos Commune, stated: "we give notice: that \[regarding\] the
fields, timber, and water which the landlords, científicos, or bosses
have usurped, the pueblos or citizens who have the titles corresponding
to those properties will immediately enter into possession of that real
estate of which they have been despoiled by the bad faith of our
oppressors, maintain at any cost with arms in hand the mentioned
possession; and the usurpers who consider themselves with a right to
them \[those properties\] will deduce it before the special tribunals
which will be established on the triumph of the revolution".[^13]

## Organisation

Radical agrarian reforms were carried out by Manuel Palafox, who was
appointed by Zapata as the state's Secretary of Agriculture. Municipal
councils of local elders were convened in order to determine how to
break up the *haciendas* and redistribute their land holdings, with
decisions being passed from the bottom-up to the Zapatista command for
enforcement. "<a   href="Workers&#39;_cooperative.md" class="wikilink"
title="Workers&#39; cooperative">Workers' cooperatives</a> were also
established to manage agricultural output, while credit unions were set
up in order to support the reorganisation of land ownership.[^14]

The land was distributed to communities and individuals leading to a
radically egalitarian communal form of social organization. Neighbors'
assemblies were empowered as a form of local self-government responsible
for political, economic, and defensive functions. Quoting the General
Law on Municipal Liberties decreed by Zapata: "Municipal liberty is the
first and most important of democratic institutions, since nothing is
more natural or worthy of respect than the right which citizens of any
settlement have of arranging by themselves the affairs of their common
life and of resolving as best suits them in the interests and the needs
of their locality".[^15]

In October 1915, the Zapatistas passed a series of laws that brought
industry under
"<a   href="state_ownership.md" class="wikilink" title="state ownership">state
ownership</a> and redistributed land to the peasantry. These reforms
were implemented in Morelos, but did not extend elsewhere in Mexico, due
to the provincialism of the Zapatistas. The agrarian reforms and the
nationalisation of the sugar industry in Morelos encouraged the state's
agricultural and industrial workers to unite around the Zapatistas'
Ayala Plan, which gave the movement a tendency towards
"<a   href="anti-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalism</a>.[^16]

## Dissolution

As Morelos itself was completely untouched by American corporate
interests, Zapata distinguished himself as one of the only Latin
American social revolutionaries that did not attack the
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a>. But the Zapatistas' threats against private property
nevertheless alarmed the government of the United States, as over
one-quarter of Mexican land was held by American corporations. They
decided to intervene in the conflict on the side of the
Constitutionalists, overseeing the ultimate defeat of the
Conventionists.[^17]

Outside of Morelos, the Mexican bourgeoisie consolidated control over
the government, culminating with the promulgation of the Constitution of
Mexico in February 1917. As the constitution included no promise of
agrarian reform, Zapata continued his rebellion against the
constitutional government of Venustiano Carranza. In April 1919, Zapata
was assassinated by government forces in Chinameca, and the Revolution
in Morelos was brought to an end.[^18]

The Morelos Commune was defeated primarily by external warfare against
it as well as compromises in the face of such external attacks.[^19]

The Zapatistas thereafter shifted their allegiance to Álvaro Obregón,
who gained their support by promising to implement their proposed
agrarian reforms. Zapata's Liberation Army of the South was incorporated
into the Constitutional Army and the war in Morelos was brought to an
end, with the Zapatista land reform being reintroduced in the southern
state.

## Legacy

Belgian critical theorist Bruno Bosteels would later compare the Morelos
Commune to the
"<a   href="Soviet_(council).md" class="wikilink" title="Soviets">Soviets</a>
of the "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, due to the
decentralised and autonomous organisational structure used for
collective decision-making in Morelos.[^20] Edward Kantowicz also
compared the Commune to the "<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">Makhnovshchina</a> in eastern Ukraine, due to
similar structures and ideals.[^21]

In contemporary history, the legacy of the Morelos Commune has been
claimed by the "<a   href="Zapatista_uprising.md" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista uprising">Zapatista uprising</a> of 1994, during which
the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) established communal
forms of governance in Chiapas. Its spirit lives on rather concretely in
the continuation of community assembly and commoning movements in the
region and beyond.[^22]
