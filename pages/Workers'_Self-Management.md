**Workers' Self-Management** (also known as **self-management**, **labor
management**, **autogestión,** **workers' control**, **industrial
democracy**and**democratic management**) refers to the democratic and
horizontal management of a workplace. In some variants, all the
worker-members manage the enterprise directly through
"<a   href="Democratic_Assembly.md" class="wikilink"
title="assemblies">"assemblies</a>; in other forms, workers exercise
management functions indirectly through the election of specialist
managers. It is a key component of

## Data

- Research of self-managed enterprises in the US, Latin America and
  Europe found self-management had staff working 'better and smarter'
  with production organized more efficiently. They were also able to
  organize more efficiently on a larger scale and in more
  capital-intensive industries than hierarchical firms.[^1]
- One meta-study of research on self-managed enterprises found that they
  'equal or exceed the productivity of conventional enterprises when
  employee involvement is combined with ownership' and 'enrich local
  social capital.'[^2]
- One massive meta-study on self-managed enterprises found that they can
  increase worker incomes by 70-80%, that they can grow 2% faster a year
  than other businesses and have 9-19% greater levels of productivity,
  45% lower turnover rates and a 30% less likely to fail in the first
  few years of operation.[^3]
- One 1987 study of self-managed firms in Italy, the UK and France found
  a “positive” relationships with productivity. It also found that they
  do not become less productive as they get larger.[^4]
- One 1995 study from the US indicates that “employees who embrace an
  increased influence and participation in workplace decisions also
  reported greater job satisfaction”.[^5]
- One 1995 study of self-management in the timber industry in
  Washington, USA found that self-management is "more efficient than the
  principal conventional firms by between 6 and 14 percent”.[^6]
- One 2011 study in France found that self-managed businesses “had a
  positive effect on workers’ job satisfaction.”[^7]
- One 2019 meta-study indicates that “the impact \[of self-management\]
  on the happiness workers is generally positive”.[^8]
- Three studies from Canada found that self-managed firms were on
  average half as likely to fail compared to hierarchical firms in the
  market economy in 10 years.[^9]
- One 2014 study from of all businesses in Uruguay between 1997 - 2009
  found that self-managed firms worker have 29% smaller chance of
  closure than other firms.[^10]
- One 2005 study from Germany found that on average 1% of businesses
  failed a year, but only 0.1% of self-managed firms.[^11]
- One 2014 study of self-managed firms in Italy found that they were the
  only kind of workplace that led to increased trust between
  workers.[^12]
- One 2018 study of self-managed firms in South Korea found that workers
  maintained higher motivation than in hierarchical firms.[^13]
- One 2013 study of self-managed healthcare firms in the US found that
  workers were significantly more satisfied with their jobs than in
  workplaces.[^14]
- One 2012 study of three Italian towns of similar demographics, income
  and geography and found that towns with more self-managed enterprises
  had:
  1.  Better mental and physical health, and longer lives, with less
      strokes and heart attacks.
  2.  Children were less likely to skip school and skipped school less.
  3.  Less crime, including less domestic violence and greater feelings
      of safety.
  4.  Higher rates of ‘social participation’ (joining clubs and
      charities; giving blood; voting).
  5.  Perception of a more positive society, more supportive personal
      networks and more trust in the government.[^15]

  productivity improved by 27% during construction work as workers'
  self-management was experimented with, due to 'a reduction in

### Algeria

During the Algerian Revolution peasants and workers took control of
factories, farms and offices that were abandoned, with the help of UGTA
militants. Around 1,000 enterprises were placed under workers' control
in 1962, with that number quickly climbing to 23,000+ in the following
years. The FLN passed laws in the newly independent Algeria which
partially institutionalized workers' control, creating a bureaucracy
around workers' councils that centralized them. This caused massive
corruption among new managers as well productivity and enthusiasm in the
project to fall, leading to numerous strikes by workers in protest.
Following a military coup in 1965, workers' control efforts were
sabotaged by the government which began to centralize the economy in the
hands of the state, denying workers control.[^22] Following the
"<a   href="Black_Spring_(Algeria).md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Spring in 2001">"Black Spring in 2001</a>, degrees of
workers' control have been practiced in the area of Kabylie, notably
"<a   href="Barbacha.md" class="wikilink" title="Barbacha">"Barbacha</a>.[^23]

### Argentina

In 1973, with the end of the self-proclaimed
"<a   href="Argentine_Revolution_(1973).md" class="wikilink"
title="Argentine Revolution">"Argentine Revolution</a>, there was a wave
of strikes and workplace occupations that rocked the country as the
first elections were held, mainly in state-owned industry. 500
occupations of workplaces were taken out overall, with 350 occurring
between the 11th and 15th of June, mostly of media outlets, health
centres and public transport and government administration. These
occupations were predominantly done in support of Peronism, and failed
to achieve any long lasting results on the eve of the Dirty War. During
the "<a   href="Argentinazo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Argentinazo">"Argentinazo</a> in 2001 and in the following years,
around 200 workplaces were taken over by their workers.

### Australia

### Czechoslovakia

Workers' control occurred during the
"<a   href="Prague_Spring.md" class="wikilink" title="Prague Spring">"Prague
Spring</a>, by January 1969 there were councils in about 120
enterprises, representing more than 800,000 people, or about one-sixth
of the country’s workers. They were banned in May 1970 and subsequently
declined.[^32]

### France

The "<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">"Paris
Commune</a> saw the first applications of workers' self-management to an
industrial economy, with 43 enterprises being given to their workers in
1871.[^33]

### Greece

Since 2016, several bankrupt factories have been re-occupied and
controlled by their former workers who blocked the auctions.

### India

Workers' Control has been common in West Bengal, where feminist workers
took control of a tea plantation in response to abuses from management
in 1974. In Calcutta, 20 factories have been taken over by their workers
throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[^34]

### Indonesia

During the "<a   href="Indonesian_National_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Indonesian National Revolution">"Indonesian National
Revolution</a>, railway, plantation and factory workers across Java
implemented workers' control from 1945 to 1946, until it was crushed by
the new Indonesian Nationalist Government.[^35] In 2007, over a thousand
workers in Jakarta inspired by workers' control in Argentina and
Venezuela "<a   href="PT_Istana.md" class="wikilink"
title="took over a textile factory">"took over a textile factory</a> in
response to wage cuts, repression of a recently organized union and

title="Zapatista Communities">"Zapatista Communities</a> since 1994.
Since 2011, "<a   href="Cherán.md" class="wikilink" title="Cherán">"Cherán</a>
has built 3 new self-managing enterprises, a greenhouse, a sawmill and a
concrete factory.[^37]

### Poland

Workers' control had been practiced in Poland during the Revolution of
1905 as workers protested a lack of political freedoms and poor working
conditions. Workers' control also occurred in around 100 industries in
the aftermath of
"<a   href="World_War_I.md" class="wikilink" title="World War I">"World War
I</a> with around 500,000 participants. Notably in the short-lived
"<a   href="Republic_of_Tarnobrzeg.md" class="wikilink"
title="Republic of Tarnobrzeg">"Republic of Tarnobrzeg</a>.[^38] As
"<a   href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">"World War
II</a> was ending, workers took over abandoned and damaged factories and
began running them between 1944 and 1947. In the aftermath of the 1956
Poznan Protests, workers' control was partially applied in 3,300
workplaces, but the top-down nature made people lose faith in them.

### Russia

Between the Revolutions in 1917, several instruments of worker
representation rose up, called Factory committees. Each committee had
varying degrees of workers' representation; with some acting as organs
of worker control and management (or at least supervising the managers),
while others acted as rudimentary forms of trade unions, participating
in collective bargaining agreements. However after the
"<a   href="October_Revolution_(Russia).md" class="wikilink"
title="October Revolution">"October Revolution</a>, the factory
committees became under the control of the trade unions, while following
a continuing trend of centralization within the soviets.

The USSR experimented with workers' control with the
"<a   href="Kuzbass_Autonomous_Industrial_Colony.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony">"Kuzbass Autonomous
Industrial Colony</a> thanks to the influence from
"<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="IWW">"IWW</a> from 1922 to 1926 before being destroyed by the
government. During May 1988, Under Gorbachev - along with his reforms of
perestroika and glasnost - the Supreme Soviet implemented the Law on
Cooperatives. This legislation enabled and regulated the creation of
worker owned and control of enterprises, while imposing high taxes and
employment restrictions (which deterred the creation of them).

### Serbia

From 2003 to 2004 in the city of Zrenjanin, workers battled a private
security force after they had taken control of
"<a   href="Jugoremedija.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jugoremedija">"Jugoremedija</a>, a pharmaceutical factory. They
were given ownership and control of the factory in 2006.[^39]

### Spain

During the "<a   href="Revolutionary_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">"Spanish Revolution</a> in 1936 and 1937, 1700
workplaces were taken under workers' control. All industry in
"<a   href="Marinaleda.md" class="wikilink" title="Marinaleda">"Marinaleda</a>
has been under workers' self-management since 1990s. The town has seen
full employment and the lowest house prices in Spain.[^40]

### Sri Lanka

Under self-management, workers were able to efficiently run the
"<a   href="Sri_Lanka_Transport_Board.md" class="wikilink"
title="largest bus service">"largest bus service</a> in the world with
7,000 buses from 1958 to 1978. The ending of self-management in the
industry has led to an increase in accidents, late buses and
overcrowding.[^41]

### Syria

Workers' control has been practiced in several cities and towns during
the "<a   href="Syrian_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Syrian Civil War">"Syrian Civil War</a> since 2012 as they
maintain agriculture, run hospitals and maintain basic social services

"<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">"Rojava</a>, with around
a third of all industry being placed under workers' control as of
2015.[^44]

### Turkey

In 2013, the "<a   href="Free_Kazova.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kazova textile factory">"Kazova textile factory</a> in Istanbul
was occupied by its workers, and in 2014 it was converted into a worker

### Ukraine

Workers' Control was practiced in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921 within the
"<a   href="Free_Territory_of_Ukraine.md" class="wikilink"
title="Free Territory of Ukraine">"Free Territory of Ukraine</a> in
farms, factories, railways and schools.

### United Kingdom

In the 1970s, 260 workplaces were occupied across the UK, many being run
with self-management.[^46]

### United States

In 1919, the "<a   href="Seattle_Uprising.md" class="wikilink"
title="Seattle Uprising">"Seattle Uprising</a> saw workers' control in
milk deliveries, cafeterias, firefighting and laundry.[^47]

From 1968 to 1972, General Electric experimented with self-management at
their plant at Lynn River Works in Massachusetts as part of their
"<a   href="Pilot_Program_(General_Electric).md" class="wikilink"
title="Pilot Program">"Pilot Program</a>. The results led to immediate
increases in output and machine utilisation, and a reduction on
manufacturing losses. The program was terminated after it threatened the
traditional authority of management and led to too much self-reliance,
self-respect and self-discipline among workers.[^48]'

In 1976,
"<a   href="Gore_Associates.md" class="wikilink" title="Gore Associates">"Gore
Associates</a> introduces a high degree of self-management in their
factories, which the company credits with its ability to make

advocating for workers' self-management.

### Venezuela

Following the "<a   href="Bolivarian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolivarian Revolution">"Bolivarian Revolution</a>, there have been
two waves of expropriations linked to workers' self-management. The
first occurred between 2003 and 2005, the second from 2009 to 2010, both
occurred with limited support from the state and unions. With Hugo
Chavez claiming 1,100 workplaces had been put under self-management.
However, heavy state involvement, a lack of autonomous worker organizing
and corruption led to a strong feeling of apathy and growth of a
bureaucracy. But in spite of this development, several successful
cooperatives have developed from this process, drawing inspiration from
figures like
"<a   href="Anton_Pannekoek.md" class="wikilink" title="Anton Pannekoek">"Anton
Pannekoek</a> and historical episodes of workers' control in Argentina
and Yugoslavia.[^50]

### Yugoslavia

In Yugoslavia, there was a limited degree of workers' control of
industry which was encoded into law in 1950. This occurred due to the
Tito-Stalin Split and inspiration from the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">"Paris
Commune</a>. However, the poorly designed, top-down nature of the
workers' councils led to corruption, cynicism and inefficiencies until
they were destroyed in the
