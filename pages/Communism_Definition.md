# Communism Definitions

## Overview

"<a   href="Communism.md" class="wikilink" title="Communism">Communism</a> is
a stateless, classless, hierarchy-less and moneyless society based on
common ownership,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and the principle of "from each according to ability, to each according
to needs." A communist is one who believes such a society is both
achievable and desirable.

Communism is a form of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
because it rejects all forms of hierarchical authority and coercive
governance, organizing society through voluntary autonomous communes
rather than state power.

Communism is a form of
"<a   href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialism">socialism</a>
because it abolishes "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> in the means of
production, replacing
"<a   href="capitalist.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
social relations with common ownership and cooperative production for
human need rather than profit.

## Dictionary and Encyclopedia Definitions

Classical encyclopedic definitions of communism, emphasize the core
principles of common ownership and abolition of
"<a   href="class.md" class="wikilink" title="class">class</a> distinctions:

*Cambridge Dictionary* - "the belief in a society without different
social classes in which the methods of production are owned and
controlled by all its members, and everyone works as much as they can
and receives what they need, or a social and political system based on
this belief."

*Collins Dictionary* - 'Communism is the political belief that all
people are equal and that workers should control the means of producing
things."

*Oxford Learners Dictionary* - "a theory or system of social
organization in which all property is owned by the community and each
person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs."

*Wikipedia, Communism* - "Communism (from Latin communis 'common,
universal') is a political and economic ideology whose goal is the
creation of a communist society, a socioeconomic order centered on
common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange
that allocates products in society based on need. A communist society
entails the absence of private property and social classes, and
ultimately money and the state. Communism is a part of the broader
socialist movement."

*Encyclopedia Britannica* - "Communism is a political and economic
system that seeks to create a classless society in which the major means
of production, such as mines and factories, are owned and controlled by
the public. There is no government or private property or currency, and
the wealth is divided among citizens equally or according to individual
need."

Non-statist definitions consistently emphasize:

- Abolition of private property in favor of common ownership
- Elimination of class distinctions and social hierarchy
- Production organized for social need rather than exchange
- Distribution based on need rather than labor-time or market value
- Voluntary cooperation rather than coercive authority

## The Concept of "Commune"

The word "communism" derives from "commune," and communism is understood
as a commune of communes. Understanding what "commune" inherently
implies illuminates the structural logic of communist social
organization.

### Etymology

**Latin roots:**

- From Latin *communis* = "common, shared by all"
- From reconstructed Proto-Indo-European \*ko-moin-i- = "held in common"
- Literally: \*ko- (together) + \*moi-n- (to change, go, move)
- Original meaning: "Shared by all through movement/exchange together"

**Medieval development:**

- Latin *commūnia* = "community, state, things held in common"
- French *commune* = "free city, group of citizens" (12th century)
- 1792: Revolutionary France applies it to "community organized and
  self-governed for local interest"

**The verb "to commune":**

- Middle English (c.1300): "to share, to make common"
- Late 14th century: "to talk intimately, to communicate intimately"
- Core idea: Intimate sharing and communication without barriers

### Structural Implications

**Unimpeded communication:**

The act of "communing" implies direct, intimate communication between
people without intermediaries. Face-to-face interaction and dialogue
create shared understanding through direct contact with complete
transparency.

If people are genuinely communing with each other, there can be no class
barriers, no hierarchy preventing free communication, and no authority
mediating relationships. The concept structurally requires the absence
of social divisions that would impede direct human connection.

**Common ownership and sharing:**

The root meaning (Latin *communis* = common) implies things held in
common—plural possessions shared rather than individually hoarded. This
represents communal property versus private property, with shared
resources available through common holding.

The concept inherently contains the principle of property abolition—not
meaning nobody can use anything, but that everything is available to all
through common stewardship.

**Mutual care and responsibility:**

"Communing together" suggests reciprocal relationships of giving and
receiving,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
meeting each other's needs, shared work through collective labor, and
joint decision-making where everyone has voice.

If everyone is responsible for everyone else's wellbeing and everyone
contributes to meeting collective needs, the concept implies "from each
according to ability, to each according to need"—even when not
explicitly stated.

### Summary of Implications

**From the word "commune" (shared in common):**

- Common ownership (classlessness)
- Shared resources (moneyless economy or movement toward it)

**From the verb "to commune" (intimate communication):**

- Direct, unmediated relationships (hierarchy-less)
- Face-to-face organization (human scale)

**From the plural "communes" (multiple autonomous communes):**

- "<a   href="Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="Federation">Federation</a>
  (cooperation without central government)
- Horizontal coordination (no state above)

**From the historical experience of actual communes:**

- Economic and political revolution must proceed together
- Cannot be merely "autonomous cities" under capitalism
- Cannot be merely "socialist economy" under authoritarian government
- Must be simultaneously stateless and propertyless

## Origins

### Early Origins (1840s)

The term "communism" emerged in France around 1840, used by radical
working-class revolutionaries who called themselves *communistes*. It
was initially somewhat interchangeable with "socialism," though
"communism" often signaled a more revolutionary, insurrectionary
approach versus reformist "socialism."

Early French communists like
"<a   href="Étienne_Cabet.md" class="wikilink" title="Étienne Cabet">Étienne
Cabet</a> and groups around "<a   href="Théodore_Dézamy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Théodore Dézamy">Théodore Dézamy</a> developed ideas about common
ownership and egalitarian communities. The political usage represented a
new articulation of age-old communal practices and egalitarian
aspirations.

### Marx and Engels (1840s-1890s)

"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and
"<a   href="Friedrich_Engels.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> adopted "communism" in
their famous 1848 *"<a   href="Communist_Manifesto.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a>*, partly to
distinguish themselves from
""<a   href="utopian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian socialists">utopian socialists</a>." However, their usage
remained inconsistent—they often used "socialism" and "communism"
interchangeably throughout their writings. When they did distinguish
them, communism represented:

- The final stage after a transitional "socialist" period
- A stateless, classless society
- Implementation of "from each according to ability, to each according
  to needs"
- Abolition of commodity production

Marx never provided a detailed blueprint—his descriptions of communism
were relatively vague and scattered across different works, focusing
more on critique of capitalism than systematic vision of the
alternative.

### Anarchist Crystallization (1870s-1890s)

The definition of communism as an immediately stateless, classless,
hierarchy-less and moneyless society crystallized primarily through
anarchist theorists. "<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist communists">Anarchist communists</a>—particularly
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, and
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">Élisée
Reclus</a>—articulated communism as:

- A post-state situation (no transitional state apparatus)
- Classless and hierarchy-less social organization
- Moneyless economy with abolition of wage labor and exchange
- Commune of communes—free
  "<a   href="federation.md" class="wikilink" title="federation">federation</a>
  of voluntary associations
- "<a   href="Mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">Mutual aid</a>
  rather than coercion as organizing principle
- Production for need with free distribution according to need

Kropotkin's works, particularly
*"<a   href="The_Conquest_of_Bread.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Conquest of Bread">The Conquest of Bread</a>* (1892) and
*"<a   href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid">Mutual Aid</a>* (1902), provided the most systematic
articulation of this vision. The phrase "anarchist communism" or
"anarcho-communism" emerged to distinguish this approach from both
Marxist state-transitional theories and
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>.

### The Bolshevik Confusion (1917 onwards)

The "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> and
"<a   href="Bolshevism.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevism">Bolshevism</a>
fundamentally confused the definition of communism.
"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lenin&#39;s">Lenin's</a> party called itself "Communist" but
established a powerful
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> apparatus,
creating lasting semantic problems:

- The stated goal remained communism (stateless, classless)
- The actual system was a party-state
  "<a   href="dictatorship.md" class="wikilink"
  title="dictatorship">dictatorship</a>
- Communist countries were state-socialist systems claiming to be
  building toward communism
- Western countries labeled the
  "<a   href="USSR.md" class="wikilink" title="USSR">USSR</a> and similar
  states as "communist countries" because they were ruled by
  "<a   href="Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Communist Parties">Communist Parties</a>—not because these
  states had achieved communism

Many anarchists and
"<a   href="left_communism.md" class="wikilink" title="left communists">left
communists</a> argue the USSR was never communist—it was
"<a   href="state_capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalist">state capitalist</a> or
"<a   href="state_socialist.md" class="wikilink" title="state socialist">state

relations.

## Tendencies

Communism as an anarchist political philosophy encompasses several
related tendencies and interpretations:

**"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communism">Anarcho-communism</a>:**

The primary tendency, articulated by Kropotkin and others, advocating
immediate establishment of stateless communist social relations based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
voluntary association, and distribution according to need. This tendency
rejects all transitional states and hierarchical organization.

**"<a   href="Platformism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Platformism">Platformism</a>:**

A more organizationally-focused tendency emerging from the experiences
of the "<a   href="Russian_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>, advocating for tactical
unity and coordinated revolutionary organization while maintaining
commitment to stateless communist goals. Associated with the
"<a   href="Organizational_Platform_of_the_General_Union_of_Anarchists.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists">Organizational
Platform of the General Union of Anarchists</a>.

**"<a   href="Insurrectionary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Insurrectionary anarchism">Insurrectionary anarchism</a>:**

A tendency emphasizing immediate revolutionary action and permanent
conflict with all authority, often skeptical of formal organizations.
While not always explicitly communist in economic vision, shares the
commitment to immediate abolition of state and class.

**"<a   href="Communization.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communization">Communization</a> theory:**

A more recent tendency arguing communism must be immediately established
in revolutionary rupture, rejecting all transitional periods, worker
management of capitalism, or gradual reforms. Emphasizes communism as an
activity (communizing) rather than a distant goal.

## The Communism Test

In determining whether a society or proposed system qualifies as
communist, it must satisfy three essential criteria. All three
conditions must be met—failing any single test means the society is not
communist.

### Test 1: Is it stateless?

A communist society must have no
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> apparatus—no
coercive governmental authority exercising a monopoly on legitimate
violence over a territory.

**Questions to ask:**

- Does a "<a   href="nation-state.md" class="wikilink"
  title="nation-state">nation-state</a> exist claiming sovereignty over
  the territory?
- Is there a governmental structure that can compel obedience through
  force?
- Do police, military, courts, or prisons enforce compliance with rules?
- Can individuals or groups be coerced against their will by an
  authority?

**What passes:**

- Voluntary federations of autonomous communes
- Coordination through free agreement and consensus
- Rotation of administrative tasks without permanent authority
- Conflict resolution through community processes

**What fails:**

- Any system with a permanent government, regardless of its form
- Democratic states—representative democracy still involves state
  coercion
- 'Workers' states" or "dictatorship of the proletariat" — these are
  still states
- One-party rule claiming to represent the working class

**Examples:**

- The "<a   href="USSR.md" class="wikilink" title="USSR">USSR</a> failed this
  test—it had a massive state apparatus with secret police, gulags, and
  party dictatorship
- "<a   href="Revolutionary_Catalonia.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a>
  (1936-1939) largely passed this test in many areas where collectives
  operated without state authority
- "<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> somewhat
  fails this test — despite radical democracy, it maintains governmental
  structures and military forces

### Test 2: Is it classless and hierarchy-less?

A communist society must eliminate all forms of systematic
domination—economic, political, and social hierarchy cannot exist.

**Questions to ask:**

- Do some people control the means of production while others must sell
  their labor?
- Is there a ruling body or individual—whether called president,
  chairman, council, or assembly—that makes binding decisions for
  others?
- Can some people command others based on position or role?
- Are there permanent divisions between rulers and ruled, managers and
  managed, leaders and followers?

**What passes:**

- Rotational administration with immediate recall
- Horizontal organization where all have equal say
- Free association allowing people to leave arrangements they disagree
  with
- Decisions made by those affected, not imposed from above

**What fails:**

- "<a   href="Wage_labor.md" class="wikilink" title="Wage labor">Wage labor</a>—whether
  private capitalist or "socialist" state employer
- Party elites, technocratic planners, or bureaucratic administrators
- Military hierarchies and command structures
- Representative systems where elected officials exercise authority over
  constituents

**The hierarchy question:**

Some argue certain "natural" hierarchies (parent-child, teacher-student,
doctor-patient) are acceptable. Anarchist communists respond:

- These relationships need not be hierarchical—they can be based on
  care, expertise sharing, and voluntary cooperation
- To the extent coercion exists (parent physically restraining toddler
  from danger), it must be minimal, temporary, and genuinely protective
- Any permanent, structural system of command and obedience constitutes
  hierarchy incompatible with communism

**Examples:**

- The USSR failed this test catastrophically—party elite controlled
  economy and wielded absolute political power
- "<a   href="Israeli_kibbutzim.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Israeli kibbutzim">Israeli kibbutzim</a> partially failed—some
  maintained internal equality but relied on exploited external labor
- "<a   href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
  communities largely pass this test through cargo system rotation and
  collective decision-making

### Test 3: Is it moneyless?

A communist society must abolish monetary exchange,
"<a   href="wage_labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">wage labor</a>,
and commodity production. Resources must be held in common and
distributed according to need.

**Questions to ask:**

- Do people work for wages or other forms of payment?
- Are goods and services bought and sold?
- Does money mediate access to necessities?
- Is production organized for exchange value rather than use value?

**What passes:**

- Free distribution from common stores
- Production organized to meet identified needs
- Contribution according to ability without expectation of equivalent
  return
- Gift economy and mutual aid networks
- Labor vouchers or other non-circulating credits (debated—some
  anarchists accept these as transitional)

**What fails:**

- Any "<a   href="market.md" class="wikilink" title="market">market</a>
  economy, even "market socialism" with worker co-ops
- Wage systems, including "socialist wages" in state enterprises
- Currency of any kind that circulates and accumulates
- Barter systems (which can evolve into money)

**The labor voucher debate:**

Some communists distinguish between:

- **Money** (circulates, accumulates, can be hoarded or used for power)
- **Labor vouchers** (one-time use certificates for individual labor
  contribution, destroyed upon use)

Anarchist communists generally reject even labor vouchers as:

- Maintaining capitalist logic of equivalent exchange
- Creating incentives for selfishness rather than solidarity
- Administratively complex and prone to bureaucracy
- Unnecessary when production is sufficient for all needs

**Examples:**

Most historical "communist" states failed this test—they used money,
wages, and commodity production
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> collectives often
passed this test—many distributed based on need or used family-based
distribution

Even "<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>
theory acknowledges "lower stage communism" (socialism) retains wages
and equivalent exchange—only "higher stage communism" abolishes them
entirely

### Comprehensive Application

A society is communist **only if** it simultaneously satisfies all three
tests. Partial fulfillment is not communism:

- **Stateless but not classless/moneyless**:
  "<a   href="Feudalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Feudalism">Feudalism</a>,
  warlord territories, some anarcho-capitalist visions—these lack states
  but maintain hierarchy and exchange
- **Classless but not stateless/moneyless**: Impossible in practice —
  maintaining classlessness requires either state coercion or successful
  abolition of exchange
- **Moneyless but not stateless/classless**: Subsistence societies under
  authoritarian rule, prison economies — these may lack money but
  maintain domination

The three criteria are interconnected:

- States exist to maintain class divisions and property relations
- Class hierarchy requires either state enforcement or economic coercion
  through scarcity
- Money mediates class relationships and enables accumulation of power

True communism requires simultaneously dissolving all three—state,
class, and money—through revolutionary transformation creating entirely
new social relations based on freedom, equality, and cooperation.

## Criticism

### Right-wing Criticisms

**Human nature objections:**

Critics argue humans are inherently selfish, competitive, or
hierarchical, making communism impossible or requiring authoritarian
enforcement.

**Anarchist communist response:**

- Anthropological evidence shows humans evolved through cooperation and
  "<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
  not pure competition
- Human behavior is largely shaped by social conditions—capitalism
  produces capitalist behavior
- Voluntary communes have functioned successfully throughout history
- The question is not whether communism fits "human nature" but whether
  it creates conditions for human flourishing

**Economic calculation problem:**

Free-market economists argue without prices determined by supply and
demand, rational economic calculation becomes impossible, leading to
inefficiency and shortages.

**Anarchist communist response:**

- Modern technology enables coordination without prices through
  communication and information systems
- Gift economies and mutual aid networks have distributed resources
  effectively for millennia
- "<a   href="Capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a>
  itself produces massive inefficiency—overproduction, planned
  obsolescence, poverty amid plenty
- Production for need rather than profit eliminates perverse incentives

### Authoritarian Socialist Criticisms

**Transitional state necessity:**

Marxist-Leninists argue a transitional "workers' state" is necessary to
suppress counter-revolution and develop productive forces.

**Anarchist communist response:**

- Transitional states become new ruling classes defending their own
  interests
- The means shape the ends—authoritarian means cannot produce
  libertarian outcomes
- "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>,
  "<a   href="Free_Territory.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Territory">Free
  Territory</a>, and other examples show stateless defense is possible
- Developing productive forces under state control reproduces capitalist
  relations

**Lack of central planning:**

Some socialists argue voluntary federation cannot coordinate complex
modern economies without central planning authorities.

**Anarchist communist response:**

- Decentralized coordination through federation is more flexible and
  responsive than central planning
- Central planning has consistently failed—from Soviet shortages to
  ecological catastrophe
- Modern communication technology enables sophisticated coordination
  without hierarchy
- Local knowledge is essential for meeting real needs

### Reformist and Liberal Criticisms

**Utopianism and impossibility:**

Reformists argue communism is a utopian fantasy; gradual reform within
existing systems is more realistic.

**Anarchist communist response:**

What seems "impossible" is historically contingent—slavery and monarchy
once seemed permanent Reform has consistently failed to address root
causes of exploitation and domination Working-class self-organization
has created communist social relations in revolutionary situations The
"realism" of reformism accepts permanent injustice

### Anarchist Internal Debates

**Individualist anarchist critiques:**

Some "<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchists">individualist anarchists</a> argue
communism requires coercing individuals into collective arrangements and
suppressing individual property.

**Anarchist communist response:**

- Anarchist communism is voluntary—communities form through free
  association
- Individual property
  "<a   href="Usage_Rights.md" class="wikilink" title="Usage Rights">Usage
  Rights</a> in personal possessions is distinct from
  "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
  title="private property">private property</a> in means of production
- True individuality requires material security and freedom from
  exploitation
- Communal abundance enables individual flourishing better than
  competitive scarcity

**Market anarchist alternatives:**
"<a   href="Mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutualists">Mutualists</a>
and market anarchists propose non-capitalist markets as alternatives to
both state socialism and communism. **Anarchist communist response:**

- Markets inevitably produce inequality as some accumulate more through
  exchange
- Exchange relations maintain alienation and commodity fetishism
- Gift economy and free distribution create superior social bonds
- Markets require enforcement mechanisms that tend toward hierarchy
