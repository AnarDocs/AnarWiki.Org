Huehuecoyotl is an ecovillage in Mexico's Sierra del Tepozteco mountain
range and a member of the
"<a   href="Global_Ecovillage_Network.md" class="wikilink"
title="Global Ecovillage Network">"Global Ecovillage Network</a>. Two
Mexican radicals and about 25 of their European, US, and Mexican
followers founded the community in 1982. Members started a
collectively-run school in the nearby town of Tepoztlan, which lasted
for 16 years and enrolled over 100 children. The ecovillage has also
organized Earth Guardians Visions Councils, weeklong camps where
hundreds gathered to learn about permaculture, bioregionalism and hear
indigenous leaders speak on ecological stewardship.[^1]

In 2015, Huehuecoyotl's website listed the names of 15 residents.[^2]
The ecovillage no longer runs collective economic projects or regular
coordinating meetings, but members still collectively own and manage the
land.[^3]
