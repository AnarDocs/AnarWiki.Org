## Background

Panama's military dictatorship began in 1968 when
<a href="Torrijos_Dictatorship" class="wikilink"
title="Omar Torrijos">Omar Torrijos</a>, a populist general, led a coup
and against the democratic government and promoted a mixture of populist
and nationalist policies. Although he repressed dissent, he did create a
plan for allowing municipal elections in 1980 and presidential elections
in 1981. However, he was killed (likely assassinated) in a plane crash
in 1981, and the subsequent elections were tainted by widespread
allegations of fraud and soon General Manuel Noriega took power by
force. Noriega's dictatorship worked with the

<a href="Contra_War_(Nicaragua)" class="wikilink"
title="Contra War">Contra War</a> in Nicaragua, engaged in drug
trafficking, was deeply corrupted and kidnapped, tortured and often
killed dissenters.

## Events

At first, the family of dissenter Dr. Huge Spadatora organised small
protests and religious observances in protest, but these quickly faded.
However, in June 1987, Noriega forcibly retired his Chief of Staff, who
became an outspoken opponent of the regime accusing Noriego of
assassinating Torrijos, electoral fraud, drug trafficking and selling
visas to
<a href="Cuban_Exiles" class="wikilink" title="Cuban exiles">Cuban
exiles</a>. Discontent grew and the National Civic Crusade (CCN) was
created by various businesses, trade unions and activist groups. They
organised several <a href="Capital_Strike" class="wikilink"
title="capital strikes">capital strikes</a> and daily protests were held
despite the government killing several protesters.

As the demonstrations spread, the government responded by declaring a
state of emergency, suspending constitutional rights, and instituting
censorship. The government threatened to arrest those involved in the
protests and seize the property of businesses that joined in the strike,
closed the schools and <a href="University" class="wikilink"
title="universities">universities</a>, and unleashed a virulent
propaganda campaign accusing its opponents of being linked with
<a href="Timeline_of_US_Imperialism" class="wikilink"
title="United States interests">United States interests</a> that wanted
to abort the
<a href="Panama_Canal" class="wikilink" title="Panama Canal">Panama
Canal</a> treaties. Soon the Catholic church joined in criticising the
government but refused to formally endorse the CCN. Periodic protests,
strikes, and demonstrations continued throughout the second half of
1987. Besides the CCN, many labor unions, women’s associations, and
medical associations also staged protests. Relations with the USA
deteriorated rapidly as the government charged the US embassy with
supporting the opposition An attack on the embassy by a mob and the
arrest of United States diplomatic and military personnel by the
government led to a suspension of military assistance and increased
economic sanctions by the United States. The CCN attempted to organise
elections in <a href="Revolutions_of_1989_-_1992" class="wikilink"
title="1989">1989</a> and they were shut down by Noriega who soon
declared war on the USA, leading to a
<a href="US_Invasion_of_Panama_(1989)" class="wikilink"

## Results

Although the movement was cut short by the US invasion, it is notable
that after the invasion, Panama has held free elections since, is
considered to be the eighth most democratic country in the Americas
