# Consent

## Overview

**Consent** is a foundational anarchist principle referring to voluntary
agreement between individuals that is free from coercion, intimidation,
or compulsion. Anarchists understand consent as **mutual agreement**
where all parties are fully informed and free to make voluntary
choices.[^1]

The concept of consent stands in direct opposition to coercion - the use
or threat of force to compel compliance. From an anarchist perspective,
genuine consent can only exist in the absence of hierarchical power
relations that create unequal conditions for decision-making.

As <a href="Gustav_Landauer" class="wikilink"
title="Gustav Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a> articulated, "The State is a
condition, a certain relationship between human beings, a mode of human
behavior; we destroy it by contracting other relationships, by behaving
differently."[^2] This emphasizes that anarchism is fundamentally about
replacing coercive relationships with consensual ones.

## Consent and Individual Freedom

Anarchists define consent as requiring **enthusiastic yes** - agreement
spoken in the absence of coercion, intimidation, or intoxication.[^3]
This understanding recognizes that true freedom necessitates the ability
to refuse without penalty or consequence.

<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>
holds that "people can voluntarily cooperate to meet everyone's needs,
without bosses or rulers, and without sacrificing individual
liberties."[^4] This cooperation must be based on genuine consent rather
than submission to authority. As the text explains, anarchists "are
opposed to order arbitrarily imposed and maintained through armed force
or other forms of coercion. They struggle for the order that results
from the consensual interaction of individuals, from voluntary
association."[^5]

The anarchist vision can be illustrated through the example of friends
on a camping trip: they plan together, share skills and tools
voluntarily, organize work collectively, and no one holds authority over
anyone else. Importantly, "no one is bound to go along with the group,"
and individuals can leave without persecution.[^6] This demonstrates
consent-based organization in practice.

## Historical Development of Consent Theory

### Early Origins

The political theory of consent emerged in English thought during the
16th and 17th centuries. John Ponet's *A Short Treatise of Politike
Power* (1556) was among the earliest works to articulate that rulers
derive their authority from the people, and that "neither pope, Emperor,
nor king may do any thing to the 'hurt' of his people without their
consent."[^7]

Ponet argued that individuals had property rights that could not be
violated without consent, citing the biblical example of Naboth refusing
to sell his vineyard to the king, "for by God's law he had a property
therein, from which without his will and consent, he could not be forced
to depart."[^8]

### The Levellers and Consent

The <a href="Levellers" class="wikilink" title="Levellers">Levellers</a>
of 17th century England took consent theory further, arguing that
political authority must rest on the voluntary agreement of individuals.
Richard Overton wrote in *An Arrow Against All Tyrants* (1646):

> "Every man by nature being a king, priest, prophet, in his own natural
> circuit and compass, whereof no second may partake but by deputation,
> commission, and free consent from him whose right and freedom it
> is."[^9]

The Levellers recognized liberty of conscience as inseparable from
political consent. As one contemporary noted, this "anarchy of religious
freedom" logically extended to political organization - guaranteeing
liberty for all necessarily meant guaranteeing liberty for each
individual.[^10]

During the Putney Debates (1647), John Wildman articulated clearly: "I
conceive that's the undeniable maxim of government: that all government
is in the free consent of the people. If so, then upon that account
there is no person that is under a just government, or hath justly his
own, unless he has by his own free consent be put under that
government."[^11]

### The Anarchist Implications

Critics of consent theory immediately recognized its radical
implications. Sir Robert Filmer, writing between 1635-1642, argued that
consent theory inevitably led to anarchy. He pointed out that if "by
nature all mankind in the world makes but one people" who are "born
alike to an equal freedom from subjection," then:

> "every petty company hath a right to make a kingdom by itself; and not
> only every city, but every village, and every family, nay, and ever
> particular man, a liberty to choose himself to be his own King if he
> please... which upon the matter, is to have no King at all, but to
> leave all men to their natural liberty."[^12]

Filmer identified the central problem: if individual consent is required
for legitimate government, then any individual has the right to withdraw
that consent. This makes stable coercive government impossible. As Carl
Watner notes, Filmer "clearly saw where his own doctrine was leading
him... His only way out was to make 'consent' include an agreement to
abide by majority rule."[^13]

## The Critique of "Tacit Consent"

### Locke's Evasion

<a href="John_Locke" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>,
recognizing the radical implications of consent theory, developed the
doctrine of "tacit consent" to salvage government legitimacy. He argued
that merely residing in a territory or using roads constituted implied
consent to government authority.[^14]

This doctrine was immediately criticized. David Hume (1748) dismissed it
as absurd: "Can we seriously say that a poor peasant or artisan has a
free choice to leave his country, when he knows no foreign language or
manners, and lives from day to day by the small wages which he acquires?
We may as well assert that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely
consents to the dominion of the master, though he was carried on board
while asleep, and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he
leaves her."[^15]

### Spooner's Demolition

<a href="Lysander_Spooner" class="wikilink"
title="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> delivered the most
thorough critique of tacit consent in his *No Treason* essays
(1867-1870). He argued that voting, residing in a territory, or using
government services do not constitute genuine consent to government
authority.

Spooner wrote: "The Constitution was never signed, nor agreed to, by
anybody, as a contract, and therefore never bound anybody, and is now
binding upon nobody."[^16] He pointed out that:

> "If the government can take a man's money without his consent there is
> no limit to the additional tyranny it may practice upon him...
> Government have no more right, in nature or reason to 'assume' a man's
> consent to be protected by them, and to be taxed for that protection,
> when he has given no actual consent, than a fire or marine insurance
> company have to assume a man's consent to be protected by them, and to
> pay the premium, when his actual consent has never been given."[^17]

Spooner explicitly connected consent to
<a href="property_rights" class="wikilink"
title="property rights">property rights</a>: "To take a man's property
without his consent is robbery; and to assume his consent where no
actual consent is given, makes the taking none the less robbery."[^18]

## Consent in Social and Sexual Relations

### Power Dynamics and Consent

Consent becomes compromised when unbalanced power dynamics exist. As
consent educator Carey French explains, "When unbalanced power dynamics
exist, our ability to give and receive consent is compromised. (It is
tough to say no to someone who holds more power if I fear the
consequence of that no.)"[^19]

Power shows up between:

- Students and teachers
- Employees and bosses
- Different social positions (race, class, gender, sexuality, ability)

Importantly, **if no is not available, yes is not valid**. This
principle applies universally - from sexual encounters to employment
relationships to political systems.[^20]

### The Revolution of Consent Culture

Practicing good consent requires revolutionary changes in how we relate
to each other. This includes:

**Recognizing our power and minimizing its effects** - Those with
privilege must actively work to create conditions where others can
genuinely say no without consequence.

**Asking rather than assuming** - We cannot assume consent based on past
interactions, relationships, or social roles.

**Knowing our boundaries and communicating them** - Each person must
develop awareness of their own limits and share them clearly.

**Receiving a no gracefully** - When someone says no, they are saying
YES to themselves and sharing their authentic boundaries - this is a
gift to be honored.[^21]

## Patriarchy, Hierarchy, and the Impossibility of Consent

### How Hierarchies Undermine Consent

Hierarchical systems fundamentally compromise the possibility of genuine
consent. Under
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>,
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
and state power, apparent "choices" are made under conditions of
coercion, economic necessity, or threat of violence.

Fred Woodworth identified how government claims of legitimacy are
fundamentally incompatible with consent: "Any claims to power made by a
monarchy, constitutional democracy, theocracy, nationalist fatherland or
people's republic are totally bogus since they govern without the
consent of the governed. Any constitution, contract or agreement that
claims to bind everyone living in the same geographic area, unborn
generations, or anyone other that the actual parties to it, are
despicable falsehoods."[^22]

The critique extends beyond formal government to all hierarchical
institutions. When leadership in an organization becomes corrupted by
power, "membership is no longer voluntary, but is imposed on whoever
falls within whatever the organization decides is its jurisdiction. Laws
and authority which were originally aimed at preventing harm are turned
into tools for inflicting harm on whoever is targeted by the
elite."[^23]

### The Illusion of Consent Under Capitalism

<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a>
creates conditions where economic coercion replaces physical force.
Employees must "consent" to exploitation because the alternative is
poverty and starvation. This is not genuine consent but submission to
economic necessity.

As the text explains: "Employees are treated like just another input
into the production process: their labor is 'bought' when needed, at the
market price, and no longer 'purchased' when the need has passed. But
since employees need to provide for themselves and their families,
regardless of the condition of the labor market or the treatment they
receive at the hands of their employers, they live in constant
insecurity."[^24]

This "wage slavery" operates through structural coercion rather than
explicit force, but it equally undermines the possibility of genuine
consent to work arrangements.

### Patriarchy and Sexual Consent

Under patriarchal systems, women's apparent consent is compromised by
structural inequalities, economic dependence, socialization into
submission, and threat of violence. True sexual consent requires not
just the absence of explicit force, but the presence of genuine freedom,
safety, and equal power.

The feminist principle that "the personal is political" recognizes that
seemingly private relationships cannot be separated from broader power
structures. Consent in intimate relationships cannot be fully realized
while patriarchal power relations persist in society.

## Why Only Anarchism Enables True Consent

### The Fundamental Contradiction

There exists a fundamental contradiction between government and consent.
As <a href="Josiah_Tucker" class="wikilink" title="Josiah Tucker">Josiah
Tucker</a> identified in the 18th century, consent theory pushed to its
logical conclusion destroys the moral authority of all government: "The
sole question between Tucker and his Lockean opponents was 'Whether That
Government is to be justly deemed an Usurpation, which is not founded on
express mutual Compact of all the Parties interested therein, or
belonging thereunto?'"[^25]

Anarchists who embrace consent theory to its fullest "were not concerned
with the goodness or badness of governmental laws, but rather with the
ultimate title or authority of governments themselves to legislate any
laws at all."[^26]

William Molyneux articulated this clearly in 1698: "I have no other
Notion of 'Property', but a 'Power of Disposing my Goods as I please',
and not as another shall Command: Whatever another may 'Rightfully' take
from me 'without my Consent', I have certainly no 'Property' in. To
'Tax' me without Consent, is little better, if at all, than 'downright
Robbing me'."[^27]

### Anarchism as Consensual Social Relations

Anarchism alone takes consent seriously as the foundation for all
legitimate social arrangements. As Gustav Landauer wrote: "We can
establish a great number of crafts and industries to produce goods for
our own consumption. We can go much further in this than the
cooperatives have gone until now, for they still cannot get rid of the
idea of competing with capitalist managed enterprise."[^28]

The anarchist approach means:

- **No binding contracts without explicit individual consent** - No
  constitution or social contract can bind those who did not personally
  agree to it

<!-- -->

- **Continuous consent, not one-time agreement** - The right to withdraw
  consent must exist at all times

<!-- -->

- **Economic arrangements based on voluntary cooperation** - Whether
  through cooperatives, mutual aid, or other forms, economic relations
  must be based on genuine consent rather than necessity

<!-- -->

- **Abolition of hierarchies that create unequal power** - Only among
  equals can genuine consent exist

<!-- -->

- **Direct action and voluntary association** - Rather than
  representation or delegation, individuals make decisions directly and
  associate freely

### Creating Consent-Based Society

Anarchists recognize that consent-based society cannot be imposed by
force. As the text explains: "It would be impossible to compel people to
participate in an anarchist project, since anarchism relies on voluntary
cooperation and self discipline to make it work. Once large numbers of
people agree that this is the way things should be organized, not even a
tyrant can stop them from reorganizing themselves."[^29]

The path forward involves:

**Building alternatives based on consent** - Creating cooperatives,
communes, and voluntary organizations that demonstrate consent-based
relations in practice

**Education and consciousness-raising** - Helping people understand both
the necessity and possibility of consent-based organization

**Dismantling hierarchies** - Working to eliminate the power structures
that make genuine consent impossible - patriarchy, capitalism, the
state, white supremacy

**Practicing consent in all relations** - Developing the skills of
asking, listening, honoring boundaries, and respecting autonomy in
everyday interactions

As <a href="Elisee_Reclus" class="wikilink" title="Elisee Reclus">Elisee
Reclus</a> wrote: "When the miserable and disinherited of the earth
shall unite in their own interest, trade with trade, nation with nation,
race with race; when they shall fully awake to their sufferings and
their purpose... powerful as may be the Master of those days, he will be
weak before the starving masses leagued against him."[^30]

## Conclusion

The principle of consent, when taken to its logical conclusion, leads
inevitably to anarchism. Any system of government based on coercion, any
economic system based on exploitation, any social hierarchy based on
domination - all of these violate the principle of genuine consent.

For three centuries, critics of consent theory have recognized that it
"inevitably to contend that government rests on consent is to lay the
groundwork for anarchy."[^31] Anarchists embrace this conclusion: only
by abolishing all coercive hierarchies can we create the conditions for
genuine consent to flourish in all areas of human life.

The anarchist vision is of "safe and mutually empowering
connections"[^32] - relationships, communities, and social structures
built entirely on voluntary cooperation among equals. This requires not
just the absence of overt coercion, but the positive creation of
conditions where everyone has the power to say both yes and no, and
where those choices are honored completely.
