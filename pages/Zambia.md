## History

### Human Settlement

Humans have lived in territory claimed by the state for at least 200,000
years, as the first human fossils discovered in Africa were found there
(in 1921). The first societies, known as the Khoisans, were nomadic
foragers who collected fruit and nuts and occasionally hunting antelope.

### Iron Age

In the 400s, the
<a href="Bantu_Migration" class="wikilink" title="Bantu Migration">Bantu
Migration</a> occurred, who developed self-sufficient villages of
wattle-and-daub huts, introducing <a href="agriculture" class="wikilink"
title="agriculture">agriculture</a>, growing sorghum and beans while
raising cattle and goats. They also had iron tools and weapons,
alongside pottery making. The Khoisan population was destroyed by a
<a href="genocide" class="wikilink" title="genocide">genocide</a> or
assimilated into the new culture.

Trade began to develop in the new society, and copper coins were used as
a currency as mining intensified. The society exported ivory and
imported cotton textiles, rivers were also dammed to give societies
access to <a href="water" class="wikilink" title="water">water</a>. Four
new kingdoms, the Kazembe-Lunda, Bemba, Chewa and Lozi emerged around
the Zambezi river as the most powerful
<a href="State_(Polity)" class="wikilink" title="states">states</a> in
the region.

### European Colonialism

Representatives of the Portuguese Empire came to the territory via
Mozambique in the 1700s, trading between the empire and the new kingdoms
of Mwata Kazembe and Barotseland began. In the newly formed Makololo
Empire, which refused to trade with Ottomans and Portuguese, it collapse
into a civil war over fights between the ruling class over who should
rule, destroying the empire.

In 1888, during the Scramble for Africa, Cecil Rhodes obtained mining
rights from local chiefs. The
<a href="British_South_Africa_Company" class="wikilink"
title="British South Africa Company">British South Africa Company</a>
took control of the territory later that year and used it as a source of
labour. It became a major exporter of copper, producing 13% of the
world's copper in 1938, although in

### Independence

In 1964, Zambia was granted independence from the
<a href="British_Empire" class="wikilink" title="British Empire">British
Empire</a> as part of
<a href="Decolonisation_in_Africa" class="wikilink"
title="decolonisation">decolonisation</a>. The ideology of
<a href="African_Socialism" class="wikilink"
title="African Socialism">African Socialism</a> was adopted, building

economy based around central planning and nationalisation modeled of
Julius Nyerere's policies</a> in Tanzania as well as building relations
with <a href="China" class="wikilink" title="China">China</a> and
Yugoslavia. In 1972 Zambia became a dictatorship, banning all political
parties and firing dissidents in the government. The policies of
<a href="Import_Substitution" class="wikilink"
title="import substitution">import substitution</a> worked until 1975,
where the economy contracted by 30% between 1975 and 1990. This was
because copper prices fell due to the USSR flooding the market, leading
Zambia to take on loans from the IMF and World Bank, leading to the
imposition of Structural Adjustments.

Zambia also allied itself with
<a href="Anti-Colonialism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-colonial">anti-colonial</a> movements in Africa, allowing
<a href="African_National_Congress" class="wikilink" title="ANC">ANC</a>
members from South Africa to take shelter in the country, leading to
occasional raids by South African special forces. The Zimbabwe People's
Revolutionary Army had a military base in the country, and shot down two
civilian airlines with
<a href="USSR" class="wikilink" title="USSR">USSR</a> supplied
heat-seeking missiles. This led to the closing of Zambia's borders,
leading to electricity and food shortages as refugees poured into the
country from
<a href="Angolan_Civil_War" class="wikilink" title="Angola">Angola</a>.

### Collapse of Dictatorship

Massive discontent with the dictatorship and commodity shortages
occurred, leading to a
<a href="Zambian_Strike_Wave_(1981)" class="wikilink"
title="strike wave in 1981">strike wave in 1981</a>, protests in the
late 1980s and <a href="Zambian_Food_Riots_(1990)" class="wikilink"
title="massive food riots in 1990">massive food riots in 1990</a> and an
attempted military coup. This resulted in the ban on political parties
being lifted and the first elections occurring in 1991, ending one-party
rule. The new government, led by a former trade unionist, began a
campaign of massive austerity and privatisation leading to falling
incomes and economic stagnation. Many more coups have been attempted and
the country remains authoritarian to this day, despite this bleak
future, copperminers' went on strike in
