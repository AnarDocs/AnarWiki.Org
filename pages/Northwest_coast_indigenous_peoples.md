From Harold Barclay, People Without Government [^1]:

> In the Northwest Coast of America, the Indians developed one of the
> most elaborate cultures known for a hunting-gathering people. It was
> based largely upon fishing and whaling. These people were the great
> potlatch givers. They developed a complex ceremonial system of. gift
> giving and partying by which individuals sought to outdo and so shame
> or 'flatten' others by their generosity. Through potlatching one could
> earn various named and privileged ranks. Thus society was divided into
> three groups: those who held one or more ranks; freemen who held no
> rank but who were kinsmen of those who did and were expected to assist
> in amassing wealth for potlach party engagements; and, finally, at the
> bottom there were slaves. These were persons captured in warfare or
> others given to pay damages for an offence. This ranking system should
> not be confused with a class system. Ranking involves differential
> status of individuals; class involves differential status of groups.
> Thus among the Northwest Coast Indians a man might acquire many titles
> and be of highest rank. Yet other members of his family might well not
> have this status at all. An eldest son would inherit 'nobility' from
> his father, while the youngest son was little more than a commoner.
> There are differences in wealth and sharp competitions for prestige
> and for the limited number of ranked positions. Yet the competition
> involved has sometimes been misunderstood as some flagrant,
> individualistic form which would be dear to the heart of the laissez
> faire capitalist. Actually, that which existed between rank holders
> vying for yet more exalted positions depended upon wealth which was
> provided by the co-operative group activity of the kinsmen of the rank
> holder. If competition existed at all levels of the system· it would
> have . been totally unworkable. This is something few of those who
> worship at the altar of competition see, namely, that co-operation is
> fundamental to all human activity, even to being able to compete.
>
> The man with the highest rank in a village is often referred to as the
> 'chief'. However, as in other instances of this kind, this usage is
> misleading. A senior ranked 'noble' was called a chief because he was
> senior and consequently had priyileges which were not shared with
> others. Thus among the Nootka the chief or senior 'noble' of several
> local settlements had certain prior rights to the salmon streams and
> ocean waters for fish and sea mammals; he owned important root and
> berry patches and the salvage materials which landed on the shores of
> his territory.
>
> The chief was expected to demonstrate liberality, generosity and
> leadership. Yet he had little or no authority to impose his will by
> force. He was not a chief in the sense of executive officer with
> police powers.
>
> Among the Carrier of the British Columbia interior, when families
> quarrelled the 'chief called all the people to his house where he
> covered "his head with swan's down, the time honored symbol of peace,
> and dance(d) before them to the chanting of his personal song and the
> shaking of his rattle". After the dance he delivered an oration on the
> wealth he and his clan-phratry had expended to get titles. He exhorted
> the disputants to settle their quarrel and warned of the troubles
> which would come if it continued (Jenness, 518). This was the limit of
> his contribution to settling disputes. The phratry chief among the
> Carrier ordered murderers to fast for twenty-five days and he presided
> at a ceremony in which the murderer and his clan's people handed over
> a blood price.
>
> Writing of the West Coast Indians in general, Drucker reports that "in
> the rare instances when blood was shed" within a kin group "usually
> nothing was done" since the group could not take revenge upon itself
> or pay itself blood money (1965, 74). Revenge was resorted to when a
> person of one kin group murdered one in another. Among most of the
> Coastal people (except for the Kwakiutl and Nootka) the alternative to
> a revenge attack in the case of intergroup murder was for one person
> from the offending group to be asked to "come forth voluntarily to be
> slain". Witches accused of practising black magic were often slain and
> these killings went unavenged.
>
> Northwest Coast societies seem to represent cases of marginal anarchy,
> where the 'chiefs' or 'nobles' , as men of clear rank and privilege,
> held more 'legitimate' authority than others. Yet the situation was
> still sufficiently ambiguous for such chiefs to have no monopoly of
> force and most social control mechanisms were clearly of a diffuse or
> religious nature.
