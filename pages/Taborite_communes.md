![](Taborites.png "Taborites.png") Starting in 1419, during the
Husserite Christian heretical revolution of Bohemia (in today's Czech
Republic), a radical sect called the Taborites ran a network of
communist and stateless towns, most prominently Tabor itself (near
Prague), named after the Biblical mountain. Although the Taborites held
onto their territory for decades, their experiment in anti-authoritarian
communism ended after a couple years due to isolation and a failure to
set up an economy capable of producing what people needed. As the
Taborite movement shifted in a hierarchical direction, an anarchistic
Adamite sect emerged.

# Taborite towns

The Husserite revolution against Papal and and German authority began
after the preacher John Hus, was burnt as a heretic in 1414 by the
church. Hardly a radical, Hus had simply claimed that the Papacy was a
human institution, not a divine one. Most Husserites belonged to the
lower classes, including "weavers and other cloth-workers, tailors,
brewers, smiths - in fact manual workers in many trades." The revolt
initially sought merely reform, but sections of the revolution took on
much more radical dimensions beginning with an insurrection in 1419.[^1]

During this insurrection, radical Husserites established communes which,
Cohn explains, "formed an embryonic society which was wholly outside the
feudal order and which attempted to regulate its affairs on the basis of
brotherly love instead of force."[^2] These communards later became
known as the Taborites, after their most prominent stronghold, Tabor.
The Taborites wanted to abolish private property and build what Cohn
(unsympathetically) calls an "anarcho-communist order."[^3]

With a military led by John Zizka, the Taborites managed to "fight off
the invaders in battle after battle."[^4] Taborite proclamations called
for social horizontality and the expropriation of the rich:

"All shall live together as brothers, none shall be subject to another."

"All lords, nobles and knights shall be cut down and exterminated in the
forests like outlaws."

"As Mine and Thine do not exist at Tabor, but all possession is
communal, so all people must always hold everything in common, and
nobody must possess anything of his own; whoever owns private property
commits a mortal sin."[^5]

Taborites shared all wealth equally and socialized some workplaces.[^6]
However, their failure to socialize production on a large scale became a
major weakness. Cohn goes so far as to argue that "they altogether
ignored the need to produce."[^7]

The movement controlled five strongholds in February 1420, and
proclaimed that all other towns would be consumed by fire. Many sold
their belongings and moved to these five towns.[^8] The Taborites were
not above violent attacks on their ideological opponents. The Taborite
preacher Jan Capek proclaimed, "Cursed is the man who restrains his
sword from spilling the blood of the enemies of the Christ. Each
believer must wash his hands in blood."[^9]

## Taborite women

Silvia Federici notes, "Women were very active in the Taborite movement
as in all heretic movements. Many fought in the battle for Prague in
1420 when 1500 women dug a long trench which they defended with stones
and pitchforks."[^10]

## Failure of anarchistic experiment

Major causes of anarchism's failure among the Taborites included the
failure to communize production, isolation, and the pressures of
warfare.

When wealth ran out, the Taborites resorted first to expropriating
nearby wealthy households and then to robbing neighoring peasant
communities. Soon, the Taborite communes gave up their attempts toward
communism and horizontality.[^11]

Kenneth Rexroth emphasizes the impacts of isolation:

> If socialism in one country is doomed to become deformed and crippled,
> communism in one city is impossible for any length of time. Sooner or
> later the garrison society will weaken but the outside world does not.
> It is always there waiting, strongest perhaps in times of peace. Tabor
> was never able to balance its popular communism of consumption with an
> organized and planned communism of production, nor the exchange of
> goods between city communes and peasant communes.[^12]

Another factor was that the pressures of warfare prompted the Taborites
to adopt a hierarchical structure. While Cohn vastly understates the
ability of anarchists to engage in self defense, there may be some truth
to his commentary: "Above all, from March 1420 onwards the Taborites
were involved in the national war against the invading armies...Not even
a Taborite army could function without a hierarchy of demand."[^13]

# Adamites

Within the Taborite towns, a radical strand of about two hundred people
called the Adamites emerged, heavily influenced by the Free Spirit
Heresy. The Adamites, deemed "ultra-anarchists" by Cohn, lived without
property and without marriage. They were often nude, claiming to be in
the Edenic state of innocence, and held naked rituals around a fire.
Cohn reports that "free love seems to have been the rule," and, "On the
strength of Christ’s remark about harlots and publicans, the Adamites
declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter their messianic
Kingdom."[^14] Bookchin describes the Adamites as a hedonistic sect of
the predominantly ascetic Taborites.[^15]

The Adamites enjoyed territorial autonomy for about two months, from
December 1420 to January 1421.[^16] Under attack, the Adamites declared
war on surrounding villages and burnt alive men, women, and
children.[^17] Tabor's army exterminated the Adamites in October
1421.[^18]

# Decline

The Taborites declined after a military defeat in 1434, and they lost
control of Tabor in 1452.[^19]
