Anarchy</a>.*

From 1918 to 1921, Ukrainians established an autonomous region with
seven million residents. Surrounding the city of Gulai-Polya, residents
ran several anarcho-communist communes and held regional Congresses. The
Insurrectionary Army, with grassroots rule-making procedures and elected
officers, defended the region against Austrian and German invaders, the
right-wing White Army and against the Bolsheviks' Red Army. The
movement's participants are often called “Makhnovists,” after the
region's prominent organizer and military commander Nestor Makhno. By
the end of 1921, the Red Army had wiped out the Makhnovist movement.

## Culture

While opposing nationalism, the Makhnovists sought “to encourage local
culture and language.” In October of 1919, the Insurrectionary Army
encouraged school teachers to teach their classes in whatever language
the local population preferred.[^1]

## Decisions

When the Insurrectionary Army liberated a town from state control, it
would post a notice clarifying they would not impose any authority on
the town:

> Workers, your city is for the present occupied by the Revolutionary
> Insurrectionary (Makhnovist) Army. This army does not serve any
> political party, any power, any dictatorship. On the contrary, it
> seeks to free the region of all political power, of all dictatorship.
> It strives to protect the freedom of action, the free life of the
> workers, against all exploitation and domination.
>
> The Makhnovist Army does not therefore represent any authority. It
> will not subject anyone to any obligation whatsoever. Its role is
> confined to defending the freedom of the workers. The freedom of the
> peasants and the workers belongs to themselves, and should not suffer
> any restriction.[^2]

The territory's workers and peasants governed themselves without a
state, but the most systematic direct democracy took place in the towns
that organized themselves as free communes. The first commune, “based on
the non-authoritarian principle”, was located near Gulai-Polya and had
over 300 residents.[^3]

The Makhovists organized periodic Regional Congresses, where delegates
from many communities gathered. Voline describes the Regional Congress
of October 1919, where over 200 delegates showed up, made their own
agenda, and made decisions on issues like how to provide medical care to
soldiers in the Insurrectionary Army.[^4]

## Economy

Voline writes that the communes near Gulai-Polya were “experiments in
free communism.”[^5] Workplaces federated into districts, and districts
federated into regions.[^6] The Makhnovists established a Commission of
Initiative, made of delegates from labor unions. The Commission advised
workers, helping them restart factories and railroads. The Makhnovists
continued using paper currency but planned “more fundamental reforms”
toward anarcho-communism. In Gulai-Polya, people organized classes and
schools based on the anti-authoritarian pedagogy of the Spanish educator
Fransisco Ferrer.[^7] In Gulya-Polya, anarchists set up three secondary
schools, and literacy increased throughout the area.[^8]

## Crime

The Makhnovists “demolished prisons wherever they went. In Berdyansk the
prison was dynamited in the presence of an enormous crowd, which took an
active part in its destruction. At Aleksandrovsk, Krivoi-Rog,
Ekaterinoslav and elsewhere, prisons were demolished or burned by the
Makhnovists. Everywhere the workers cheered this act.”[^9] In a 7
Jaunary 1920 declaration, the Makhnovists called for police to be
replaced by grassroots self-defense groups.[^10]

An episode at a regional congress on 12 October 1919 shows how militants
held their own Commanders accountable to rules they had set. Delegates
called Commander Klein to explain why he had gotten very drunk at a
party after Klein had himself posted notices against excessive public
drinking. A delegate asked him, “Tell me, Commander Klein, as a citizen
of our city, and its military commander, do you consider yourself
morally obliged to obey your own recommendations or do you believe
yourself outside or above this notice?” Having been publicly called out
for his hypocrisy, Klein apologized, complained of boredom at a civilian
post, and asked to be sent back to the battlefront.[^11]

## Revolution

In 1918, the Communist government signed the 1918 Brest-Litovsk Treaty,
which without the consent of the Ukranians, ceded the Ukraine to the
control of the German and Austrian empires.[^12] As these empires
prepared to return expropriated land to Ukranian landlords, peasants
organized under the auspices of the all-volunteer Revolutionary
Insurgent Army of the Ukraine (RIAU), guided by Anarchist organizer and
ex-prisoner Nestor Makhno. This army elected officers and decided on all
its rules at general assemblies. "The army was organized on a
specifically libertarian, voluntary basis," writes Daniel Guerin.[^13]

By December of 1918, the Revolutionary Insurgent Army "was just over
110,000 strong, divided into four Corps, consisting of 83,000 infantry,
20,000 cavalry, assault groups, artillery, reconnaissance, medical, and
other detachments, including armoured cars and seven armoured
trains."[^14]

The Makhnovists had to fight not only against the German and Austrian
invaders, but also against Ukranian nationalists, White Army
counter-revolutionaries, and ultimately against Vladimir Lenin and Leon
Trotsky's Red Army. In 1919, Trotsky declared his preference for a White
Army victory against the Makhnovists: "It would be better to yield the
whole Ukraine to Denikin, a frank counter-revolutionary, who could be
easily compromised later by means of class propaganda, while the
Makhnovichina developed in the depths of the masses and aroused the
masses against themselves.”[^15] The Communists stopped supplying the
Insurgent Army and even tried to assassinate Makhno in May 1919
according to Voline. After a pro-Makhnovist council in Gulai-Polya
called for a Fourth Regional Congress to take place that June, the Red
Army, following Trotsky's orders, attacked the village, destroying the
communes and seizing and executing Insurgent Army militants. On 4 June,
Trotsky issued Order No. 1824, which declared the Fourth Congress
“forbidden," with all its promoters and delegates subject to be
“arrested immediately.”[^16] In response, the Congress was cancelled.
Makhno temporarily fled in order to avoid being arrested by the Red
Army.

The Makhnovists' impressive military accomplishments included a victory
against Denikin's White Army in the fall of 1919 and a joint victory
with the Bolsheviks against Wrangel's reconstituted White Army in 1921.
Peter Gelderloos summarizes some of these battles:

> They went on to hold the southern front against the armies of the
> White Russians — the aristocratic, pro-capitalist army funded and
> armed largely by the French and Americans — while their supposed
> allies, the Bolsheviks, withheld guns and ammunition and began purging
> anarchists to stop the spread of anarchism emanating from the
> Makhnovist territory. The White Russians eventually broke through the
> starved southern front, and reconquered Gulyai-Polye. Makhno retreated
> to the West, drawing off a large portion of the White armies, the
> remainder of which beat back the Red Army and advanced steadily
> towards Moscow. At the battle of Peregenovka, in western Ukraine, the
> anarchists obliterated the White army pursuing them. Although they
> were outnumbered and outgunned, they carried the day by effectively
> executing a series of brilliant maneuvers developed by Makhno, who had
> no military education or expertise. The volunteer anarchist army raced
> back to Gulyai-Polye, liberating the countryside and several major
> cities from the Whites. This sudden reversal cut off the supply lines
> of the armies that had almost reached Moscow, forcing them to retreat
> and saving the Russian Revolution.
>
> For another year, an anarchist society again flourished in and around
> Gulyai-Polye, despite the efforts of Lenin and Trotsky to repress the
> anarchists there the way they had repressed them throughout Russia and
> the rest of Ukraine. When another White incursion under General
> Wrangel threatened the revolution, the Makhnovists again agreed to
> join the Communists against the imperialists, despite the earlier
> betrayal. The anarchist contingent accepted a suicide mission to take
> out enemy gun positions on the Perekop isthmus of Crimea; they
> succeeded in this and went on to capture the strategic city of
> Simferopol, again playing a crucial role in defeating the Whites.
> After the victory, the Bolsheviks surrounded and massacred most of the
> anarchist contingent, and occupied Gulyai-Polye and executed many
> influential anarchist organizers and fighters. Makhno and a few others
> escaped and confounded the massive Red Army with an effective campaign
> of guerrilla warfare for many months, even causing several major
> defections; in the end, however, the survivors decided to escape to
> the West.[^17]

## Neighboring Societies

Contrary to a myth that the Makhnovists tolerated anti-Semitism, Makhno
organized meetings to confront anti-semitism and sent guns and
ammunition to rural Jewish communities. Working class Jews participated
in the Makhnovists' assemblies and even volunteered for their army.
After a 12 May 1919 pogrom killed 20 Jews near Aleksandrovsk, the
Makhnovist army established a commission to investigate the incident and
then shot the perpetrators. [^18]

Peter Ashinov describes the Makhnovists' outreach to the city workers:
“The Makhnovshchina . . . understands that the victory and consolidation
of the revolution . . . cannot be realised without a close alliance
between the working classes of the cities and those of the countryside.
The peasants understand that without urban workers and powerful
industrial enterprises they will be deprived of most of the benefits
which the social revolution makes possible. Furthermore, they consider
the urban workers to be their brothers, members of the same family of
workers.”[^19]

Anarchists in the cities did not always lend concrete support to the
Makhovists, a situation Arshinov attributed to Anarchists' preoccupation
with theory rather than practice and organizational weakness. Arshinov
laments, " We are obliged to state that Russian anarchists remained in
their circles and slept through a mass movement of paramount importance,
a movement which is unique in the present revolution for having
undertaken to realize the historic tasks of oppressed humanity."[^20]
Murray Bookchin recounts, "A number of urban anarchists, most notably
Voline, Arshinov and Aron Baron, found their way to the Ukraine, where
they functioned on Makhno's propaganda and educational committees; but
other urban anarchists inflexibly denigrated the mahhnovshchina as an
elemental peasant movement with the traits of a military command-no
less!"[^21]

## Criticism

Voline, an anarchist supporter of Makhno and author of *The Unknown
Revolution*, observed widespread sexism in the movement: "The second
fault of Makhno and of many of his intimates — both commanders and
others — was their behaviour towards women. Especially when drunk, these
men let themselves indulge in shameful and even odious activities, going
as far as orgies in which certain women were forced to
participate."[^22]

However, this account has been disputed by those close to Makhno. The
allegations were written after Voline and Makhno had fallen out and
after Makhno's death, when Voline took up with Makhno's widow. Ida Mett,
a Russian anarchist who knew Makhno in Paris, stated she never saw him
drunk despite observing him frequently over three years.[^23] Leah
Feldman, a Makhnovist partisan, was "sarcastic over remarks by
latter-day bourgeois feminists that Makhno being a peasant must have
been a rapist", noting that "neither non-military nor military women
were ever molested by the male partisans to her knowledge."[^24]

The Makhnovist movement demonstrably punished sexual violence and ethnic
persecution harshly. In July 1919, Makhno executed ataman Grigoriev
specifically for anti-Semitic pogroms.[^25] When seven peasants murdered
Jewish families in May 1919, the Makhnovists executed them even though
they were not part of the insurgent army.[^26] Nationalist unit
commanders convicted of attacks on Jewish colonies were also
executed.[^27]

This contradiction between Voline's account and the movement's
documented responses to violence against women reflects broader tensions
within anarchism regarding women's liberation. From its inception,
anarchism contained both progressive and reactionary positions on
gender. While "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> made the abolition of gender
inequality a central aim and anarchist women like
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, "<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>, and
"<a   href="Louise_Michel.md" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
Michel</a> were pioneering feminists, other prominent anarchists like
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> were openly
hostile to women's rights.[^28] The Makhnovist movement appears to have
exhibited similar contradictions - maintaining harsh punishments for
documented violence while potentially tolerating sexist behaviour in
other contexts.
