# A Country of Ghosts

**A Country of Ghosts** is an anarchist utopian novel by Margaret
Killjoy, first published by Combustion Books in 2014 and reissued by AK
Press in 2021 as part of their Black Dawn series. The novel presents a
fictional anarchist confederation resisting colonial invasion, serving
as both adventure narrative and exploration of practical anarchist
organizing.

## Overview

The novel follows Dimos Horacki, a journalist from the expansionist
Borolian Empire, who is sent to report on colonial military operations
in the Cerrac Mountains. After being captured by anti-imperial forces,
he encounters Hron—a decentralized anarchist confederation composed of
autonomous villages and the refugee city of Hronople. Through Horacki's
eyes, readers experience an anarchist society organized around voluntary
association, mutual aid, and collective decision-making rather than
state authority or capitalist exchange.

Killjoy wrote the novel explicitly as political speculation, stating in
the afterword that while "this book is not a blueprint," it offers "the
argument that freedom is possible." The work sits within a tradition of
anarchist fiction including Ursula K. Le Guin's
*<a href="The_Dispossessed_(Ursula_K._Le_Guin)" class="wikilink"
title="The Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>* and serves as accessible
introduction to anarchist theory through narrative form.

## Plot

Horacki begins as a cynical patriot whose earlier investigative
journalism career ended after exposing corruption. Assigned to embed
with the Imperial Army's colonial expansion, he witnesses the violence
of empire firsthand. When his military escort is ambushed, he is
captured by the Free Company of the Mountain Heather and brought into
Hron territory.

Initially an outsider, Horacki gradually learns about Hron's anarchist
organization—villages operating without formal government, communities
coordinating through voluntary agreements, and decision-making happening
through councils rather than hierarchical authority. He travels from
rural settlements to Hronople, a city of refugees built on anarchist
principles, and eventually to Karak, a settlement for those who reject
even Hron's minimal social agreements.

As the Borolian army prepares for full invasion, Horacki must choose
between his imperial origins and the anarchist society he has come to
understand. The novel culminates in Hron's defense against colonial
conquest.

## Anarchist Theory

### Social Organization

Hron demonstrates anarchist principles through practical application
rather than abstract theory. The confederation operates as "a voluntary
association of autonomous groups and individuals who cooperate to
provide one another mutual aid." Villages and cities maintain autonomy
while coordinating through the Hron Accord—a shared agreement on basic
principles rather than state constitution.

Decision-making happens through assemblies and councils where affected
parties participate directly. There are no permanent leadership
positions, police forces, or coercive authorities. Instead, social
organization relies on mutual responsibility and collective
accountability.

### Economic Relations

The novel depicts an economy based on gift exchange and mutual aid
rather than wage labor or market capitalism. Production serves community
needs rather than profit accumulation. Characters work because they want
to contribute or because social relationships create reciprocal
obligations, not because of financial coercion.

This challenges the capitalist assumption that people only work under
threat of poverty or promise of individual enrichment. Characters
explicitly reject the profit motive, with one stating they help others
"because having someone's back means someone has yours, and that's a
good way to live."

### Conflict Resolution

Rather than police or prisons, Hron addresses antisocial behavior
through community response and, in extreme cases, exile. Those who
consciously reject the social compact can move to Karak, described as
territory within but separate from Hron proper, where even minimal
social agreements don't apply.

This presents anarchist approaches to justice without state
punishment—relying on social pressure, community accountability, and in
cases of irreconcilable difference, geographical separation rather than
incarceration.

### Anti-Imperialism

Hron's anarchism developed partly through Indigenous peoples' resistance
to colonial conquest and partly through revolutionary refugees fleeing
various empires. The confederation formed when these groups found
compatible political cultures emphasizing decentralization and autonomy.

The novel presents anarchism as inherently anti-colonial, with Hron's
resistance to Borolian invasion demonstrating how stateless societies
can organize military defense without hierarchical command structures.
War councils form through voluntary participation rather than
conscription or command authority.

## Critiques and Tensions

The novel acknowledges internal contradictions within Hron's anarchist
project. Some characters express self-interested rather than
solidaristic motivations for mutual aid. Others suggest that strength
and willingness to fight, rather than genuine cooperation, keep
communities together.

The existence of Karak represents anarchism's challenge with those who
reject even minimal social agreements. The settlement operates on more
ruthless "survival of the fittest" principles, creating what one
reviewer called "a libertarian city which feels rather more dystopian."
This tension between absolute individual freedom and collective
well-being runs throughout anarchist thought.

Critics note the novel sometimes presents Hron as unrealistically
harmonious, with characters too willing to set aside personal interest
for collective benefit. The rapid cultural isolation that allowed Hron
to develop without external influence strains credibility, as does the
relative ease with which Horacki integrates into an entirely different
social system.

## Literary Context

### Utopian Tradition

*A Country of Ghosts* belongs to utopian fiction tradition stretching
from Thomas More's *Utopia* through Charlotte Perkins Gilman's
*Herland*, Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed*, and Marge Piercy's
*Woman on the Edge of Time*. Unlike contemporary dystopian fiction's
focus on failed societies, Killjoy presents a functioning alternative to
both capitalism and state socialism.

Le Guin's influence is particularly evident in the novel's approach to
anarchism and its treatment of utopia as necessarily containing
dystopian elements. As Le Guin observed, "Every utopia since Utopia has
also been, clearly or obscurely, actually or possibly, in the author's
or in the readers' judgment, both a good place and a bad one."

### Political Fiction

The work is explicitly didactic, using narrative to make anarchist
theory accessible. Killjoy acknowledges this intent, writing in the
Black Dawn series that builds on Octavia Butler's tradition of
speculative fiction addressing systemic oppression and alternative
possibilities.

Some passages read as direct political education, with characters
explaining anarchist concepts to Horacki (and readers). While this risks
feeling heavy-handed, Horacki's role as journalist and outsider makes
these explanations narratively justified. His cynicism and imperial
socialization allow the novel to address common objections to anarchism
within the story.

### Queer Representation

The novel features queer characters and relationships matter-of-factly,
with Horacki himself being gay. While Borolian society accepts
homosexuality (except in military contexts, which Killjoy uses to
critique policies like "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"), Hron treats all sexual
orientations and relationships as unremarkable.

This reflects anarchist feminist positions on personal freedom and
challenges to patriarchal norms, presenting queerness as natural rather
than exceptional.

## Reception

Reviews praised the novel's accessible presentation of anarchist ideas
and its contribution to utopian fiction. Critics noted the writing's
clarity and the plot's momentum, making political theory engaging rather
than dry.

Some reviewers criticized the didactic passages as interrupting
narrative flow, while others appreciated how the novel answers practical
questions about anarchist organization that often go unexplored in
political theory. The characterization received particular praise, with
Horacki's transformation from imperial journalist to anarchist
sympathizer portrayed as emotionally convincing despite its compressed
timeline.

Anarchist readers appreciated seeing their politics represented in
fiction beyond simplistic "chaos and violence" stereotypes. The novel
has been used in anarchist study groups and cited as accessible
introduction to anarchist thought.
