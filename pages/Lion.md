![](Okonjima_Lioness.jpg "Okonjima_Lioness.jpg") "Rather than a king or
queen, lions live in a egalitarian society without ranking," reports
*BBC Earth*.[^1]

Typically, the female lions hunt while the male lions guard the
territory. However, the male lions have been known to hunt as well. The
males and females have roughly equal success rates in hunting.[^2]

Insofar as there's a hierarchy within a lion pride, it refers to how
some males tend to breed more than females. However, the females are
highly egalitarian in this area as well. A 36-year study of 560
lionesses, published in 2001 in *Science* found that lionesses do not
establish a hierarchy that lets some breed more than others. The
lionesses have about equal reproductive success and help care for each
others' cubs. "The major finding is that the females in the lion pride
really form a true community where there's no bosses and everybody's
pretty much the same," said the study's lead researcher.[^3]
