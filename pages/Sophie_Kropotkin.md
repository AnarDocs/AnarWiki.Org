lecturer in Britain, and later directed a museum dedicated to
Kropotkin's life and work in Moscow.

## Early Life

Sofia Grigorievna Ananieva-Rabinovich was born in 1856 in Kiev to a
well-off Jewish family.[^1] When she was five, her family moved to
Tomsk, Siberia, where her father operated a gold mine. At seventeen,
revolting against the harsh conditions of the miners and refusing to
live off money earned by their labor, she left home determined to
support herself as a member of the working class. After her health
deteriorated from this difficult life, friends sent her to Switzerland
to recover.[^2]

## Marriage to Peter Kropotkin

In May 1878, Sofia met the anarchist communist theorist Peter Kropotkin
at a café in Geneva. Despite their significant age difference, they
married on 8 October 1878, beginning a devoted partnership that would
last until his death.[^3] She enrolled at the University of Bern to
study biology while he remained in Geneva, though they saw each other
regularly.

## Campaign Against Imprisonment

After Peter was arrested by French police in December 1882 and
imprisoned at Clairvaux Prison, Sophie launched a vigorous international
campaign for his release. She wrote to newspapers like *The Boston
Globe*, alleging that French anti-communist laws had enabled his
conviction without evidence to appease the Tsarist regime.[^4] She
successfully generated widespread Western sympathy, with press depicting
her as a "heroic" figure suffering through her husband's unjust
imprisonment.

In 1886, her autobiographical story "The Wife of Number 4,237" was
serialized in the anarchist periodical *Liberty*, further publicizing
their cause.[^5] The campaign grew so large that the French government
was forced to release Peter in January 1886.

## Life in Britain

Moving to Britain in 1886, Sophie established herself as a teacher and
public speaker with help from
"<a   href="Charlotte_Wilson.md" class="wikilink"
title="Charlotte Wilson">Charlotte Wilson</a>. She became a popular
lecturer throughout Surrey and London, discussing chemistry, botany, and
the political situation in the Russian Empire. Unlike her husband, she
was never depicted as a terrorist by the British press, instead being
respectfully referred to by her title of "Princess."[^6]

Sophie gave birth to daughter
"<a   href="Alexandra_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink"

carefully protected Peter from surveillance by Russian spies and managed
their household, often doubling food preparations as unexpected visitors
frequently joined their Sunday afternoon teas in Bromley.[^7]

As Peter's health declined from overwork, Sophie became increasingly
protective, even cutting him off mid-sentence when she saw him getting
too agitated. She advised him to seek warmer climates for his health and
continued caring for him throughout World War I, during which both
supported the Allied cause.

## Return to Russia

After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Sophie and Peter finally returned to
Russia, arriving in Petrograd to cheering crowds. They moved to Moscow
and later to the village of Dmitrov. Despite refusing Soviet offers to
buy rights to Peter's works, Sophie secretly accepted an academic
stipend for her botanical work to support the family.[^8]

Sophie cultivated a vegetable garden and kept a dairy cow, finding great
satisfaction in rural life. However, she grew increasingly pessimistic
about the Revolution's direction due to food shortages and worsening
conditions, even as Peter remained more optimistic.

## Museum Director

After Peter's death from pneumonia on 8 February 1921, Sophie declined
the Bolshevik government's offer of a state funeral, instead organizing
an anarchist funeral that attracted 20,000 attendees.[^9]

Sophie became director of a museum established in Peter's Moscow house,
dedicated to preserving his life and work. Working alongside anarchist
scholars including Alexander Atabekian, she kept the museum operating
throughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s despite conflicts with Soviet
authorities whose ideology clashed with Kropotkin's libertarian
theories.[^10]

She dedicated herself to translating Peter's writings into Russian and
made two trips to Western Europe in 1923 and 1929. By 1928, she reported
factional infighting within the museum committee, writing to Max Nettlau
that she hoped "none of them will be masters while I am alive."[^11]

During the Great Purge, many original committee members were arrested.
The museum was shut down by the government in 1938, three years before
Sophie's death in 1941. She was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in
Moscow.[^12]

## Legacy

Sophie Kropotkin's life exemplified the dedication and sacrifice of many
anarchist women who supported the movement through both public activism
and private devotion. Her successful international campaign for Peter's
release demonstrated the power of grassroots organizing, while her work
preserving his legacy through the museum showed her commitment to
anarchist ideas beyond her husband's lifetime.
