Originally established as a

formerly known as **Kebele**, BASE has operated continuously for three
decades as a volunteer-run space dedicated to anarchist organizing,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and community solidarity.[^1]

## History

### Origins and Squatting (1995-1998)

In autumn 1995, four homeless activists squatted an empty building at 14
Robertson Road that had previously housed the Bristol One Parent Project
and had been vacant for over six months. The building, owned by Bristol
One Family Project, had been repossessed by Lloyds Bank.[^2]

Inspired by thriving anarchist social centres in other parts of Europe,
the squatters quickly transformed the space into something beyond
housing. They established the **Kebele Kulture Projekt** (KKP),
organizing activities on anarchist principles of opposing all forms of
authority and organizing collectively without leaders.[^3]

The original name "Kebele" derives from an
"<a   href="Amharic.md" class="wikilink" title="Amharic">Amharic</a> word
meaning "community place" or "neighbourhood," referring to localized
community institutions that dealt with their own needs and concerns.
During the "<a   href="Grenada_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Grenada Revolution">Grenada Revolution</a> of 1979, Rastafarians
involved in the struggle used the term to refer to community centres
from which the revolution was based.[^4]

From the beginning, the squatters ran a Sunday Squat Cafe offering
affordable food, activities for children, and information nights. The
space became a base for local campaigns including
"<a   href="Bristol_Housing_Action_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bristol Housing Action Movement">Bristol Housing Action
Movement</a> and provided crucial support for eco-defence camps
resisting road-building projects such as the Batheaston bypass and
Syston Ring Road.[^5]

The squatters resisted eviction attempts and engaged in dialogue with
surrounding residents about community needs. By 1998, faced with the
prospect of an unpopular and well-resisted eviction, Lloyds Bank
negotiated with the squatters and agreed to sell the building for
£19,000. The **Kebele Housing Co-operative** was formed to purchase the
building through donations from supporters, community fundraising
events, and a loan from Triodos Bank.[^6][^7]

### Housing Co-operative Period (1998-2007)

Under the housing co-operative model, residents occupied the first floor
while the ground floor continued to host KKP activities. The mortgage
repayments were covered by providing secure, affordable housing for
resident members. This arrangement ensured the continuation of the
social centre as a secure space.[^8]

During this period, Kebele provided resources for early-2000s
anti-capitalist protests, including the Mayday mobilization of 2000 and
mobilizations against international summits. The space also became a
resource for the Bristol animal rights movement, hunt saboteurs, and
prisoner solidarity organizers.[^9]

Between 2002-2003, Kebele experienced a lull as some initial residents
and activists moved on. Activity picked up again in 2004 as people
organized against the G8 meeting scheduled for Scotland in 2005,
attracting a new generation of activists.[^10]

### Community Co-operative (2007-Present)

By late 2005, the housing co-operative was close to paying off its
mortgage. However, residents found it difficult living at Kebele while
effectively answering the door constantly, and the building required
major renovation after a decade of heavy use. Long discussions between
KKP activists and residents led to agreement that departing residents
would not be immediately replaced. Instead, the building would be
renovated and the KKP would expand into upstairs space.[^11]

In late 2007 (with final paperwork completed in May 2008), Kebele
evolved into the **Kebele Community Co-operative**, owned and run
collectively. The small mortgage had been paid off, reducing the need to
generate income through rent. Under this new structure, different
projects within Kebele—including the library, cafe, infoshop, bike
project, and soundsystem collectives—would meet together to collectively
run the space through
"<a   href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a> and
principles of "<a   href="non-hierarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="non-hierarchy">non-hierarchy</a>.[^12]

From 2005 onwards, Kebele experienced renewed energy. New collectives
formed, more campaign and action groups used the building, and there was
an increased sense of anarchist involvement across Bristol organizing
and activism. This period saw growth in squats and new squatted social
centres in Bristol, particularly around the Stokes Croft area.[^13]

The centre celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2015 with special events
including an Open Day in March, multiple parties, a NovemberFest lasting
almost six weeks, a UK social centre gathering in November, and a
birthday celebration in December.[^14]

### Name Change to BASE (2018)

In March 2018, the centre adopted the name **BASE** (Base for Anarchy &
Solidarity in Easton). The name change was motivated by the fact that no
one involved in the project at that time had links to Ethiopia, making
the continued use of "Kebele" feel inappropriate. The new name also
served to make clearer that the space is an anarchist social
centre.[^15]

### COVID-19 Mutual Aid Response (2020-2022)

When the "<a   href="COVID-19_pandemic.md" class="wikilink"
title="COVID-19 pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> began in 2020, BASE
volunteers initiated a
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
vegan food project called **BASE & Roses** (B&R). The project delivered
food boxes and cooked meals throughout Bristol using food donated by
local shops and tens of thousands of pounds raised through fundraising.
The entire lower floor was dedicated to food storage, and scores of
volunteers were involved in outreach, cooking, packing, and delivering
free food to 160 households weekly, later every other week, for over two
years. Political pamphlets were included with food boxes explaining the
project's principles and addressing important political issues.[^16]

Volunteers described B&R as demonstrating that anarchism can work
practically, showing that a relatively small group of people without
large financial resources could produce substantial material and
emotional support for the community based on solidarity rather than
charity, with a horizontal structure and comradely spirit.[^17]

## Characteristics

### Positives

#### Organizational Structure

BASE operates through multiple collectives that take responsibility for
specific activities, with all participants working as volunteers. The
space is organized according to anarchist principles including:[^18]

- **Collective decision-making and organization**: Decisions are reached
  by
  "<a   href="consensus.md" class="wikilink" title="consensus">consensus</a>,
  where everyone agrees, embodying
  "<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
  title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a>
- **Co-operation and mutual aid**: Working together, sharing knowledge
  and resources, and helping each other builds strong communities and
  networks
- **Direct action and taking power back**: Refusing to be spectators and
  taking power back to bring about change
- **Equality and non-hierarchy**: Organizing without leaders or bosses,
  with everyone having equal say
- **Not for profit**: Providing services either for free, for donations,
  or for minimal cost to ensure genuine affordability and accessibility
- **Openness and inclusion**: Being welcoming to everyone (except police
  and fascists) irrespective of age, race, gender, background,
  sexuality, and disability
- **Permaculture**: Following fundamental principles of earth care,
  people care, and fair share to create positive impact
- **Resistance and solidarity**: Anti-authoritarian opposition to both
  government and capitalism, supporting people in resistance everywhere
- **Vegan**: The building and garden operate as a dietary vegan space
  supporting the abolition of all non-human animal exploitation
- **Voluntary participation and shared responsibility**: All activities
  made possible by volunteers freely giving their time

#### Activities and Projects

BASE hosts several longstanding volunteer-run collectives and projects:

- **BASE Cafe**: Operating since the centre's founding, the cafe
  provides cheap vegan food every Sunday, often accompanied by political
  talks or film screenings. Food is provided on a donation basis, with
  no one turned away for lack of money. The collective has organized
  community meals including Christmas day gatherings.[^19]

<!-- -->

- **BASE Bikes**: Established in 1997, this bicycle workshop operates
  every Tuesday, helping local people fix their bikes with volunteer
  support. The collective accepts donations of old bikes, which they
  repair and sell at affordable prices. Surplus money has been donated
  to support people in Gaza, survivors of earthquakes in Southeast
  Turkey, and released prisoners from the Kill the Bill movement.[^20]

<!-- -->

- **BASE Library**: The radical library houses publications going back
  decades, offering a unique resource in Bristol where people can learn
  together and celebrate histories of resistance.[^21]

<!-- -->

- **Infoshop**: Distributes anarchist literature and information

<!-- -->

- **Allotment and Garden**: Maintained as part of the centre's
  permaculture principles

BASE has been used as a base for numerous campaigns and direct actions,
including organizing for international solidarity (such as supporting
the "<a   href="Zapatista_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista movement">Zapatista movement</a> in Chiapas, Mexico),
environmental campaigns, animal rights organizing, and anti-capitalist
mobilizations.[^22][^23]

#### Network Connections

BASE is part of a network of
"<a   href="self-managed_social_centres.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed social centres">self-managed social centres</a> in
the
"<a   href="United_Kingdom.md" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">United
Kingdom</a>, which includes

Club</a> in Brighton, and the
"<a   href="Sumac_Centre.md" class="wikilink" title="Sumac Centre">Sumac
Centre</a> in Nottingham.[^24] The growth of radical social centres
across the UK over the past two decades has created spaces where people
can explore and practice their beliefs free from state and capitalist
interference, representing an anarchist experiment in theory and
practice.[^25]

### Negatives

#### Police Repression

Despite providing community support, BASE has experienced police
repression. In the 2000s, BASE volunteers were monitored by undercover
police officers (spycops) as part of a broader undercover operation
targeting British anti-capitalist movements. More recently, in 2023,
police placed BASE under surveillance during a controversial operation
against anarchist Toby Shone.[^26]

Volunteers recall an incident more than ten years ago when police
attempted to enter the building during an animal rights gathering,
coinciding with raids elsewhere in Bristol. Volunteers called for
support, and a gathered crowd forced the police to retreat.[^27]
