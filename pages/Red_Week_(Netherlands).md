## Background

Although the Netherlands had been neutral during
<a href="World_War_I.md" class="wikilink" title="World War I">World War
I</a>, it had still triggered a number of serious problems in the
Netherlands that created the conditions for revolution in the
Netherlands:

- Severe economic crisis triggered by mines and submarines blowing up
  merchant ships in the Netherlands and the economic crisis in other
  countries caused by the war leading to very high

- Unpaid wages for soldiers

## Events

The revolution began with a mutiny of soldiers on the 25th of October at
an army base over unpaid wages, who set fire to part of their base.
Following this, debates began in the Socialist Party over the
possibility of a revolution after the events in Russia and Germany. On
the 11th of November, socialist leader Troelsta created this list of
demands:

- Abolition of the Senate
- Introduction of state retirement at the age of 60
- Immediate demobilization
- Immediate introduction of general women's suffrage
- Immediate introduction of the eight-hour legal day
- Fast and adequate provision for the housing shortage
- Socialization of all eligible companies
- Full unemployment care

In response, the government installed extra security around the royal
family and armed the police with carbine rifles, soldiers occupied key
government buildings and patrolled the streets of major cities, alcohol
sales were banned, ships were disarmed (to prevent something similar to
the <a href="Kiel_Mutiny.md" class="wikilink" title="Kiel Mutiny">Kiel
Mutiny</a>) Food rations were increased, but the government warned it
would be taken away if unrest occurred. Small skirmishes occurred
between soldiers mutinying against the government but overall a
revolution failed to materialise.

## Results

The revolution failed to take any form.
