Shifu, an anarchist influenced by Kropotkin, established the Crock-Crow
Society in 1912 in the city of Guangzhou. The Crock-Cow Society
published an influential anarchist journal, *People's Voice*. Shifu and
his followers helped launch a number of communal experiments and labor
organizing efforts that continued in Guangzhou after Shifu's death in
1915.[^1] In Guangzhou, Shifu's followers organized China's first modern
labor unions. By 1920 they organized almost forty unions in Guangzhou,
including the Teahouse Labor Union in 1918 which had 11,000 members.[^2]

Chinese and Korean anarchists collaborated on projects such as the
Movement for Rural Self-Defense Communities in Guanzhou in the 1920s.
The area "was firmly controlled by the Chinese anarchist Quin Wangshan
(1891-1970) under the *Quomindang* banner, with support from Xu Zhuoran,
a graduate of Huangpu Military Academy who sympathized with anarchist
ideals."[^3]

When the nationalist Quomindang party purged its anarchist members in
1927, many anarchists found refuge in Guangzhou. They called it "a
heaven of place," a utopia.[^4]

It has been claimed that from 1921 to 1923, "the entire city was run as
an anarchist commune"[^5] and "the entire city of Guangzhou in China"
was "an anarchist commune for a year."[^6]
