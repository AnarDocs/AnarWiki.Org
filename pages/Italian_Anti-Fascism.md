The "<a   href="Arditi_del_Popolo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Arditi del Popolo">"Arditi del Popolo</a> (The People's Daring
Ones) were co-founded in Rome in June 1921 by Argo Secondari, an
Anarchist. A decentralized anti-fascist militia, they included
Anarchists, Communists, Socialists, and republicans. Within months of
its founding, Arditi had 144 sections with 20,000 members.[^1]

Arditi arose in opposition to Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party
and *squadristi* vigilantes (Black Shirts) who intimidated organized
workers and leftists. Earlier in 1921, the *squadristi* had murdered an
Anarchist worker and then attacked his funeral.[^2]In July, when the
*squadristri* attempted to return into the town, the Arditi fended them
off and killed twenty fascists in battle.[^3]

During 1921, both the Socialist Party and the Communist Party withdrew
their support from Arditi. The Socialist Party even signed a "Pact of
Pacification" with Mussolini. The Italian Anarchist Union and Italian
Syndicalist Union became the only leftist institutions that still
supported Arditi.[^4] M. Testa comments, "Working-class militants, then
as now, could not rely on the reformist party's opposition to fascism or
on the police, and had to defend themselves from fascist violence. They
set up militias to protect their printing presses, union meetings and
social clubs."[^5]

Mark Bray offers a number of reasons why Arditi did not succeed in
stopping Mussolini's rise to power in 1922: <blockuqote> The Arditi del
Popolo were unable to withstand the Fascist onslaught for several
reasons, including the strong financial and material support the
Fascists received from economic elites, the fact that much leftist
infrastructure had already been smashed by the time Arditi were formed,
and the inability of the Left to cooperate for the destruction of their
common enemy.[^6]

# Assassination attempts

On 11 September 1926, Gino Lucetti threw a grenade at Mussolini's car.
It bounced off the windshield and exploded nearby. Mussloni's guards
arrested Lucetti and his accomplices Leandro Sorio and Stefano
Vatteroni. Sentenced to thirty years in prison, Lucetti spent the first
three in solitary confinement. Lucetti was shot and killed after an
escape from prison in 1943.[^7]

M. Testa writes:
