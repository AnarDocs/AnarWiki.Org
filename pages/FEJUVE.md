## History

### Background

During the "<a   href="Bolivian_National_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolivian National Revolution">Bolivian National Revolution</a> of
1952, thousands of miners were displaced and large sections of the
peasantry were expelled from the
"<a   href="Altiplano.md" class="wikilink" title="Altiplano">Altiplano</a>,
with many settling in the small town of
"<a   href="El_Alto.md" class="wikilink" title="El Alto">El Alto</a>. The town
quickly became a major urban center with over 850,000 residents, largely
made up of indigenous
"<a   href="Aymara_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Aymara">Aymara</a> and
"<a   href="Quechua_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Quechua people">Quechua
people</a>. The Bolivian state had little presence in the city, leaving
residents without infrastructure and basic necessities such as running
water and electricity.[^2][^3]

### Foundation

In response to widespread
"<a   href="poverty.md" class="wikilink" title="poverty">poverty</a>,
"<a   href="corruption.md" class="wikilink" title="corruption">corruption</a>
and "<a   href="violence.md" class="wikilink" title="violence">violence</a> in
El Alto, during the 1950s, the city's residents started to form their
first "<a   href="self-organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-organized">self-organized</a> neighborhood councils, based
on the traditional practices of the local
"<a   href="Aymara_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Aymara people">Aymara
people</a>. In 1957, the first council was established to provide a
program of "<a   href="universal_basic_services.md" class="wikilink"
title="universal basic services">universal basic services</a> for new
residents. The councils increasingly coordinated with each other and, by
1979, had united together into a
"<a   href="federation.md" class="wikilink" title="federation">federation</a>,
establishing the Federation of Neighborhood Councils (FEJUVE).[^4][^5]

### Divisions and Democratization

During the 1980s, the FEJUVE leadership was often
"<a   href="elitism.md" class="wikilink" title="elitist">elitist</a> and
largely kept decision-making power to themselves, while political party
activists sought to gain control over the organization. The FEJUVE and
the "<a   href="Bolivian_Workers&#39;_Center.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolivian Workers&#39; Center">Bolivian Workers' Center</a> (COB)
were coopted by the left-wing political party
"<a   href="Conscience_of_Fatherland.md" class="wikilink"
title="Conscience of Fatherland">Conscience of Fatherland</a> (CONDEPA),
resulting in a loss of autonomy.[^6]

By the early 1990s, this resulted in fragmentation of the FEJUVE,
initially dividing into factions then splitting into two separate
federations. However, the grassroots was pushing the organization
towards more
"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a> and
"<a   href="democratization.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratization">democratization</a> of decision-making. The
experience of miners' unions provided further impulse to
democratization. The grassroots established the El Alto Assembly, which
gave control back to local councils and trade unions.[^7]

By the end of the 1990s, local councils had regained control over the
FEJUVE. The democratization process halted the leadership's capacity to
act as intermediary between councils and state political parties. The
assemblies took greater control over the organization to prevent
monopolization of power by leadership.[^8]

### Consolidation

In 1994, the government passed the *Law of Popular Participation* (LPP),
which devolved a fifth of the national budget to local municipalities,
giving local communities a
"<a   href="participatory_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="participatory role">participatory role</a> in
"<a   href="participatory_budgeting.md" class="wikilink"
title="budgeting">budgeting</a> and
"<a   href="participatory_planning.md" class="wikilink"
title="urban planning">urban planning</a>. This increased FEJUVE's
influence significantly, with neighborhood councils beginning to
function as the *de facto* local governments.[^9]

The councils provided means for residents to develop their own
communities without state intervention. Residents pooled resources and
skills within neighborhood councils, securing land purchases,
construction of schools and public parks, and installation of
"<a   href="public_utility.md" class="wikilink"
title="utility services">utility services</a>. FEJUVE also mobilized
neighborhoods in protest against the government, leading movements for
establishment of the
"<a   href="Universidad_Pública_de_El_Alto.md" class="wikilink"
title="Public University of El Alto">Public University of El Alto</a> in
1998, preventing implementation of a tax on home construction in 2003,
and ending "<a   href="water_privatization.md" class="wikilink"
title="water privatization">water privatization</a> in 2005.[^10][^11]

### Bolivian Gas Conflict

During the "<a   href="Bolivian_gas_conflict.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolivian gas conflict">Bolivian gas conflict</a>, the
infrastructure that FEJUVE had built provided means for El Alto's
citizens to resist the government. The local culture of
"<a   href="collective_identity.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective identity">collective identity</a>, tied to both
neighborhood councils and residents' original communities in Altiplano,
linked urban and rural communities together. A
"<a   href="general_strike.md" class="wikilink" title="general strike">general
strike</a> shut down El Alto, with thousands mobilizing in popular
demonstrations.[^12]

The grassroots organizing was strengthened by traditional practices of
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a>, with
horizontally-organized assemblies utilizing
"<a   href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a> to
facilitate collective action. Neighborhood councils organized
roadblocks,
"<a   href="soup_kitchen.md" class="wikilink" title="social kitchens">social
kitchens</a> and community self-defense. The FEJUVE organized a blockade
of "<a   href="La_Paz.md" class="wikilink" title="La Paz">La Paz</a>,
effectively placing the capital under siege. The social cohesion
associated with neighborhood councils was consolidated during this
period of insurrection.[^13]

### Socialist Period

The government of
"<a   href="Evo_Morales.md" class="wikilink" title="Evo Morales">Evo
Morales</a> and the
"<a   href="Movement_for_Socialism_(Bolivia).md" class="wikilink"
title="Movement for Socialism">Movement for Socialism</a> (MAS) was
brought to power promising to implement the "October Agenda" proposed by
social movements including FEJUVE. However, FEJUVE found itself caught
between its own autonomy and the new left-wing government when several
leaders became government members.[^14]

The government rejected FEJUVE's proposal to elect the
"<a   href="Bolivian_Constituent_Assembly.md" class="wikilink"
title="Constituent Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> on a non-partisan
basis. The MAS succeeded in consolidating power over popular movements
and demobilizing them. However, FEJUVE's collaboration with government
resulted in a new
"<a   href="public_housing.md" class="wikilink" title="public housing">public
housing</a> program for El Alto, with integration of
"<a   href="participatory_planning.md" class="wikilink"
title="participatory planning">participatory planning</a> into the
process. The Ministry of Production and Microenterprise provided support
for El Alto's "<a   href="social_enterprise.md" class="wikilink"
title="social enterprises">social enterprises</a>, organized along
traditional lines of participatory democracy.[^15]

### Contemporary Activities

As
"<a   href="climate_change.md" class="wikilink" title="climate change">climate
change</a> caused Bolivia's glaciers to melt, by 2010 El Alto faced
increasing water scarcity. FEJUVE began calling for creation of an
autonomous municipal water company for El Alto.[^16]

During the
"<a   href="2011_Bolivian_Indigenous_rights_protests.md" class="wikilink"
title="2011 Bolivian Indigenous rights protests">2011 Bolivian
Indigenous rights protests</a>, FEJUVE called a general strike in El
Alto, demanding increased state funding for the city. After two days of
blockading roads into La Paz, Morales negotiated an end to the strike,
promising new infrastructure projects.[^17]

In October 2013, on the tenth anniversary of the Bolivian gas conflict,
FEJUVE reported that conditions hadn't improved substantially since
Morales' election. The FEJUVE called a 24-hour general strike and
boycott of government celebrations, demanding infrastructure projects
and increased funding. Morales responded by announcing construction of a
dam for El Alto and committing \$1 billion to infrastructure
improvements.[^18]

## Governance

As of 2008, FEJUVE counted 570 neighborhood councils spread throughout
El Alto's nine districts. Each council has at least 200 members, which
elect their own leadership committees and hold monthly neighborhood
assemblies, making decisions through discussion and
"<a   href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus">consensus</a>.[^19][^20][^21]

"<a   href="Party_leader.md" class="wikilink"
title="Political party leaders">Political party leaders</a>,
"<a   href="merchant.md" class="wikilink" title="merchants">merchants</a>,
"<a   href="real_estate_investing.md" class="wikilink"
title="real estate speculators">real estate speculators</a>, and those
who collaborated with past "<a   href="dictatorship.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorships">dictatorships</a> are prohibited from leadership
and delegational positions.[^22][^23][^24]

Council meetings take place in circles, with men on one side and women
on the other, making women more comfortable speaking. Leadership of
neighborhood councils has a relatively high proportion of women, around
20-30%. Once every two years, a congress of neighborhood councils is
held, with four delegates representing each council. These biennial
congresses elect the central executive committee of FEJUVE.[^25]

As an alternative to the state's policing and courts system,
interpersonal conflicts between neighbors are arbitrated by neighborhood
councils. The neighborhood councils also manage education through school
councils, which regulate curriculums and oversee teachers'
behavior.[^26]

## Economy

The "<a   href="informal_economy.md" class="wikilink"
title="informal economy">informal economy</a> of El Alto is
"<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed">self-managed</a> by the city's workers and
"<a   href="sole_proprietorship.md" class="wikilink"
title="small traders">small traders</a>. Market vendors are represented
by a street merchants' association, which regulates stall access,
maintains markets' upkeep and sanitation, mediates inter-vendor disputes
and negotiates with municipal government.
"<a   href="Taxi.md" class="wikilink" title="Taxi">Taxi</a> and
"<a   href="bus_driver.md" class="wikilink" title="bus drivers">bus
drivers</a> are similarly organized within
"<a   href="trade_union.md" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade
unions</a>, which regulate their routes and allocate itineraries.[^27]

Construction and infrastructure projects are headed by neighborhood
councils, which bring together neighbors to gather materials and work
collectively in shifts. Those refusing to work on collective projects
are issued symbolic fines of 50 pesos, though these often go
uncollected. The "<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">collective ownership</a> and
self-management of the economy by unions and neighborhood councils
brought about high levels of
"<a   href="community_cohesion.md" class="wikilink"
title="community cohesion">community cohesion</a> in El Alto.[^28]

## Crime

In response to violence and corruption of police, FEJUVE has created a
system of "<a   href="restorative_justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a> rooted in
traditional Aymaran customs. Assemblies act as mediators for minor
disputes with neighbors, and communities form collective self-defense
groups. This alternative justice system has resulted in El Alto's
relatively low crime rate.[^29]
