Anusilan Samiti, established in 1902 or 1903, was a group of athletic
and social clubs in Bengal, opposed to British colonization of India.
The group carried out targeted assassinations, bombings, sabotage, and
banditry. The Anglo-Irish anarchist Sister Nivedita, who had met with
Kropotkin and become deeply influenced by his writings, worked closely
with Arusilan Samiti and introduced them to anarchist philosophy. The
group published two papers, one in English and one in Bengali. [^1]

At their headquarters in the outskirts of Calcutta, Anusilan Samiti
members took classes in anarchism, the Bhagavad Gita, economics,
history, geography and revolution.[^2]

The group's Bengali-language frequently justified revolutionary
violence: "The laws of the English are based on brute force. If we want
to liberate ourselves from these laws, it is brute force that is
necessary."[^3] The English-language paper did arguably advocate the
taking of state power, in passages such as the following one quoted by
historian Maia Ramnath:

> \[Indian secretary of state\] Mr. Morley has said that we \[Indians\]
> cannot work the machinery of our Government for a week if England
> generously walks out of our country...\[But\] did it not strike Mr.
> Morley that if, instead of walking out the English were by force
> driven out of India, the Government will go on perhaps better than
> before, for the simple reason that the exercise of power and
> organisation necessary to drive out so organised an enemy will in the
> struggle that would ensue teach us to arrange our own affairs
> sufficiently well.[^4]
