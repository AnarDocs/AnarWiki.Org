The Shire is a region populated by festive humanoid creatures called
hobbits in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy novels *The Lord of the Rings* and
*The Hobbit*. In the prologue to the first book of *Lord of the Rings*,
Tolkien writes that the Shire has "hardly any ‘government’. Families for
the most part managed their own affairs."[^1]

Every seven years, the hobbits elect a Mayor, who performs ceremonial
functions and manages the post office and the twelve sheriffs. The
sheriffs do not make arrests or otherwise use violence. Residents for
the most part voluntarily follow a traditional set of rules that they
consider "both ancient and just."[^2]

During *The Lord of the Rings*, Saruman captures the Shire and
transforms it into an authoritarian society. When the protagonists
return, they overthrow Saruman and restore traditional, anarchic
self-government to the region.

# Economy

The Shire has an agrarian economy, and residents spend most of their
time "\[g\]rowing food and eating it."[^3] The hobbits appear to
self-manage their own "estates, farms, work- shops, and small
trades."[^4] The hobbits distrust and avoid any machinery "more
complicated than a forgebellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom."[^5]

Some hobbits are significantly wealthier than others, but by custom they
frequently give away their wealth at social gatherings. Hobbits are "as
a rule, generous and not greedy"[^6]

While the economy does not generally appear to include wage labor, a
notable exception is that the unusually wealthy Bilbo Baggins, who
acquired riches by traveling outside the Shire, hired a gardener for his
estate. Bilbo's heir Frodo continued employing a gardener.[^7]

# Crime

The hobbits voluntarily follow a set of traditional rules. It is unheard
of for one hobbit to kill another, based on Frodo Baggins's shock upon
hearing that the hobbit Smeagol had murdered the hobbit Deagol.

There are only twelve sheriffs in the Shire, or three for each of the
quarters. The sheriffs, according to Tolkien, "were in practice rather
haywards than policemen, more concerned with the strayings of beasts
than of people."[^8] Robin Smallburrow, a sheriff, describes his job as
“walking around the country and seeing folk, and hearing the news, and
knowing where the good beer \[is\].”[^9]

During *The Lord of the Rings*, Saruman captures the Shire and greatly
strengthens the power of the sheriffs. When the protagonists finally
return to the Shire and are placed under arrest, they react by laughing,
since they are unused to the sheriffs exercising coercive power.[^10]

# Neighboring Societies

Shire residents have a militia known as the Bounders, to protect the
Shire from external threats.[^11]
