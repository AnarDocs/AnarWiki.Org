# Overview

The **Zuni** (A:shiwi) are a
"<a   href="Pueblo.md" class="wikilink" title="Pueblo">Pueblo</a> people
indigenous to what is now the southwestern "United States." For
thousands of years, the Zuni maintained traditions of egalitarian
society governed communally with the facilitation of non-coercive
chiefs. Libertarian Marxist psychologist Erich Fromm described the Zuni
as a paradigmatic life-affirming (*biophilic*) society.[^1]

## History

Archaeological evidence suggests that the Zuni have been farmers in
their homeland for 3,000 to 4,000 years. The Ancestral Zuni people
inhabited the
"<a   href="Zuni_River.md" class="wikilink" title="Zuni River">Zuni River</a>
valley from the last millennium BCE, when they began using irrigation to
farm maize on at least household-sized plots.[^2]

Zuni culture is associated with Mogollon and Ancestral Pueblo peoples
cultures, who lived in the deserts of what is now New Mexico, Arizona,
Utah, and southern Colorado for over two millennia. Early settlements
like White Mound (built around 700 CE) featured pit houses, farming, and
storerooms, followed by the village of Kiatuthlanna around 800 CE. These
Mogollon villages included kivas, the ceremonial structures central to
Pueblo life.

By the 13th century, villages were built on top of mesas for defensive
purposes, including Atsinna on Inscription Rock. In the 14th century,
the Zuni inhabited a dozen pueblos containing between 180 and 1,400
rooms. The Zuni eventually built six major villages: Halona, Hawikuh,
Kiakima, Matsaki, Kwakina, and Kechipaun. Halona was located 97 km north
of Zuni Salt Lake, and the Zuni traded in salt, corn, and turquoise.[^3]

## Spanish Contact

In 1539, Moorish slave Estevanico led an advance party of Fray Marcos de
Niza's Spanish expedition, sponsored by Antonio de Mendoza who wanted
Niza to "explain to the natives of the land that there is only one God
in heaven, and the Emperor on earth to rule and govern it, whose
subjects they all must become and whom they must serve." The Zuni
reportedly killed Estevanico as a spy, or for being "greedy, voracious
and bold."[^4]

Francisco Vásquez de Coronado's expedition followed in 1540. The Spanish
met 600 Zuni warriors near Hawikuh in July 1540, capturing the village
after inflicting several casualties. Francisco Manuel de Silva Nieto
established a mission at Hawikuh in 1629 with two Franciscan priests.
They completed a church compound in 1632 and established a second
mission in Halona. Shortly afterwards, the Zuni destroyed the missions,
killing two priests, and then retreated to Dowa Yalanne, where they
remained for the next three years.[^5]

## The Pueblo Revolt

Before the
"<a   href="Pueblo_Revolt.md" class="wikilink" title="Pueblo Revolt">Pueblo
Revolt</a> of 1680, the Zuni lived in six villages. The revolt
represented a coordinated uprising against Spanish colonial oppression
across the Pueblo peoples. After the revolt, until 1692, the Zuni took
refuge in a defensible position atop Dowa Yalanne, a steep mesa 5 km
southeast of the present Pueblo of Zuni. *Dowa* means "corn", and
*yalanne* means "mountain."[^6]

After the establishment of peace and the return of the Spanish, the Zuni
relocated to their present location, returning to the mesa top only
briefly in 1703. By the end of the 17th century, only Halona was still
inhabited of the original six villages, though satellite villages were
settled around it.

Of the three Zuni missions, only the church at Halona was rebuilt after
the reconquest. According to Nancy Bonvillain, "Indeed, by the late
eighteenth century, Spanish authorities had given up hope of dominating
the Zuni and other western Pueblo Indians, and in 1799 only seven
Spanish people were recorded as living among the Zuni." In 1821, the
Franciscans ended their missionary efforts.[^7]

## American Period

In 1848, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Henderson P. Boyakin signed a treaty with
Zuni and Navajo leaders stating the Zuni "shall be protected in the full
management of all their rights of Private Property and Religion...\[by\]
the authorities, civil and military, of New Mexico and the United
States." Observing the Zuni in the 1850s, Balduin Möllhausen noted "In
all directions, fields of wheat and maize, as well as gourds and melons,
bore testimony to their industry."[^8]

The Zuni Reservation was created by the United States federal government
in 1877, and enlarged by a second Executive order in 1883.

# Culture

The Pueblo of Zuni website summarizes the horizontal society:

> "The Zuni people have lived in the American Southwest for thousands of
> years. Their cultural and religious traditions are rooted, in large
> part, in the people's deep and close ties to the mountains, river
> ways, forests, and deserts of this ancient Zuni homeland. Primarily
> being farmers, the Zuni people raise maize and wheat and engage in
> jewelry making. It has become an important additional source of income
> for the people. Traditional Zuni life is oriented around a matrilineal
> clan system and a complex ceremonial system base on a belief in the
> ancestors (ancient ones). There are six specialized esoteric groups,
> each with restricted membership and its own priesthood, devoted to the
> worship of a particular group of supernaturals. During the well-known
> Shalako Festival, held in early winter, dancers representing the
> couriers of the rain deities come to bless new homes. One way the Zuni
> people express these cultural traditions is through their art: in
> painting, pottery, jewelry, and fetish carving, for example. These
> things have significant meaning, and, to the Zuni, serve to help unite
> the past with the present. So, on the one hand, Zuni art is a material
> record of the past."[^9]

## Gender Relations

Similarly to other Pueblo societies such as the
"<a   href="Hopi.md" class="wikilink" title="Hopi">Hopi</a>, the Zuni treat
men and women equally. The Zuni have been matrilineal[^10] and
matrilocal:

> In the Zuni tribes of the Southwest, for instance, extended families -
> large clans - were based on the woman, whose husband came to live with
> her family. It was assumed that women owned the houses, and the fields
> belonged to the clans, and the women had equal rights to what was
> produced. A woman was more secure, because she was with her own
> family, and she could divorce the man when she wanted to, keeping
> their property.[^11]

The Zuni have recognized a
"<a   href="Third_gender_and_Transgender.md" class="wikilink"
title="third gender">third gender</a> known as the *lhamana* who was
assigned male at birth and adopted feminine characteristics. The
*lhamana* "dressed as women and performed women's crafts such as weaving
and potting, but also had the physical strength to fulfill certain
male-oriented pursuits such as hunting big game and cutting
firewood."[^12]

## Values

Ruth Benedict explained that the Zuni consider someone a good person if
they have "a pleasing address, a yielding disposition and a generous
heart." Erich Fromm summarizes some central themes of Zuni culture:

> "\[M\]aterial things are relatively little valued and \[...\] the
> major interest in life is religious. To put it another way, the
> dominant value is life and living itself, not things and their
> possessions. Songs, prayers, rituals, and dances are the major and
> most important elements in the system."[^13] \[...\]
>
> There is no sense of sin, especially in connection with sex, and
> sexual chastity is generally regarded with disfavor. Sex is considered
> to be an incident in a happy life, but by no means, as in some other
> rather aggressive societies, the only source of pleasure."[^14]

# Decisions

H. Bolton wrote in 1909, "In their government, they are free, for
although they have petty captains, they obey hem badly and in very few
things." E.C. Parsons reported in 1933 that the chiefs were merely
"first among equals." Based on such accounts, anthropologists concluded
that whatever hierarchies existed were "far from the coercive
kind."[^15]

Priesthood included three priests (north, above and below), and Pekwin
(the above priest) determined the religious calendar. A religious
society was associated with each of the six kivas, and each boy was
initiated into one of these societies.[^16]

# Economy

The Zuni were a traditional people who lived by irrigated agriculture
and raising livestock. The means of production - including land, game,
plants, fish, tools, and knowledge - were held in common. There was no
class stratification, and therefore economic inequalities were not large
enough to turn into coercive authority.[^17]

Gradually the Zuni farmed less and turned to sheep and cattle herding as
a means of economic development. Their success as a desert agri-economy
was due to careful management and conservation of resources, as well as
a complex system of community support. Sales of pottery and traditional
arts have provided a major source of income for many Zuni people in the
modern era.[^18]

# Crime

"Murder hardly exists; as Benedict reports from her own observation,
there is no memory of homicide," explains Fromm. He adds, "there is no
evidence that the absence of manifest hostility is due to an intense
repression of aggression and hence there is no valid reason to question
the picture of an unaggressive, life-loving, cooperative system."[^19]

# In Literature

In Aldous Huxley's novel
*"<a   href="Brave_New_World.md" class="wikilink" title="Brave New World">Brave
New World</a>* (1932), one of the main characters is John, a man of
British descent who grew up among a community of Zuni people in New
Mexico. The character serves as a contrast to the dystopian
technological society of the novel, representing connection to
traditional ways of living. Huxley, who later embraced anarchist ideas,
would explore similar themes of decentralized, communal societies in his
utopian novel
*"<a   href="Island.md" class="wikilink" title="Island">Island</a>* (1962),
which depicts a culture sharing some characteristics with Pueblo
societies - including democratic decision-making, gender equality, and
integration of spiritual practices with daily life.
