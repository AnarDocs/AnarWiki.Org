# Anarchism and Religion

## Overview

Anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of or vehemently opposed to
"<a   href="organized_religion.md" class="wikilink"
title="organized religion">"organized religion</a>.[^1] Nevertheless,
some anarchists have provided religious interpretations and approaches
to anarchism, including the idea that the glorification of the state is
a form of sinful
"<a   href="idolatry.md" class="wikilink" title="idolatry">"idolatry</a>.[^2]

Anarchists are generally non-religious and frequently anti-religious,
with the standard anarchist slogan being the phrase coined by socialist
"<a   href="Auguste_Blanqui.md" class="wikilink"
title="Auguste Blanqui">"Auguste Blanqui</a> in 1880: "Ni Dieu ni
maître!" (Neither God nor master!). The argument for this negative
connection is that religion supports politics, the Church supports the
State, and therefore opponents of political authority also oppose
religious authority.[^3]

However, religious interpretations of anarchism exist across multiple
faith traditions. Religious anarchists view organized religion mostly as
authoritarian and hierarchical, having strayed from humble origins. The
original message of great religious teachers to live a
"<a   href="simple_living.md" class="wikilink" title="simple life">"simple
life</a>, to share the wealth of the earth, to treat each other with
love and respect, to tolerate others and to live in peace invariably
gets lost as worldly institutions take over. Religious leaders, like
their political counterparts, accrue power to themselves, draw up
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">"dogmas</a>, and wage war
on dissenters in their own ranks and the followers of other religions.
They seek protection from temporal rulers, bestowing on them in return a
supernatural legitimacy and magical aura.[^4]

## Anarchist Opposition to Organized Religion

### Early Anarchist Theorists

"<a   href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">"William
Godwin</a>, author of the
*"<a   href="Enquiry_Concerning_Political_Justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="Enquiry Concerning Political Justice">"Enquiry Concerning
Political Justice</a>* (1793), the first systematic text of
"<a   href="Libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian">"libertarian</a> politics, was a
"<a   href="Calvinism.md" class="wikilink" title="Calvinist">"Calvinist</a>
minister who began by rejecting "<a   href="Christianity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christianity">"Christianity</a>, and passed through
"<a   href="deism.md" class="wikilink" title="deism">"deism</a> to
"<a   href="atheism.md" class="wikilink" title="atheism">"atheism</a> and then
what was later called "<a   href="agnosticism.md" class="wikilink"
title="agnosticism">"agnosticism</a>.[^5]

The pioneering German "<a   href="Individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">"individualist anarchist</a>
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">"Max
Stirner</a> began as a left-Hegelian, post-Feuerbachian atheist,
rejecting the 'spirit' (Geist) of religion as well as of politics
including the spook of 'humanity'.[^6]

"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, the first
person to call himself an anarchist, who was well known for saying
""<a   href="Property_is_theft!.md" class="wikilink"
title="Property is theft">"Property is theft</a>", also said "God is
evil" and "God is the eternal X".[^7]

"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>'s
*"<a   href="God_and_the_State.md" class="wikilink"
title="God and the State">"God and the State</a>*, published posthumously
in French in 1882, was one of the first anarchist treatises on religion.
Bakunin became an atheist while in Italy in the 1860s. When he
established the International Revolutionary Association with former
supporters of Mazzini, who broke with him over his deism, Bakunin wrote:
"God exists, therefore man is a slave. Man is free, therefore there is
no God. Escape this dilemma who can!" which appeared in his unpublished
*Catechism of a Freemason*.[^8] Bakunin expounded his philosophy on
religion's place in history and its relationship to the modern political
state.

"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communism">"Anarcho-communism</a>'s main theorist
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> was a child of the Enlightenment and the Scientific
Revolution, and assumed that religion would be replaced by science and
that the Church as well as the State would be abolished. He was
particularly concerned with the development of a secular system of
ethics which replaced supernatural theology with natural biology.[^9]

### Anticlericalism in Anarchist Movements

"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> and
"<a   href="Carlo_Cafiero.md" class="wikilink" title="Carlo Cafiero">"Carlo
Cafiero</a>, the main founders of the Italian anarchist movement, both
came from freethinking families. Cafiero was involved with the National
Secular Society when he visited London during the 1870s.[^10]

In the French anarchist movement,
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Elisée Reclus">"Elisée
Reclus</a> was the son of a Calvinist minister and began by rejecting
religion before moving on to anarchism.[^11]
"<a   href="Sébastien_Faure.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sébastien Faure">"Sébastien Faure</a>, the most active speaker and
writer in the French movement for half a century, wrote an essay titled
*Twelve Proofs of God's Inexistence*.[^12] German
"<a   href="insurrectionary_anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionary anarchist">"insurrectionary anarchist</a>
"<a   href="Johann_Most.md" class="wikilink" title="Johann Most">"Johann
Most</a> wrote an article called "The God Pestilence".[^13]

In the United States, freethought was a basically anti-Christian,
anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual
politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious
matters. A number of contributors to
*"<a   href="Liberty_(1881–1908).md" class="wikilink"
title="Liberty">"Liberty</a>* were prominent figures in both freethought
and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George E. MacDonald was a
co-editor of *Freethought* and, for a time, *The Truth Seeker*. E.C.
Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought and free love journal
*"<a   href="Lucifer,_the_Light-Bearer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lucifer, the Light-Bearer">"Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</a>*.[^14]
The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive
force in and of itself. Late 19th century and early 20th century
anarchists such as "<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">"Voltairine de Cleyre</a> were often
associated with the freethinkers' movement, advocating
"<a   href="atheism.md" class="wikilink" title="atheism">"atheism</a>.[^15]

In Europe, similar developments occurred in French and Spanish
individualist anarchist circles. Anticlericalism gained relevance as the
French Republic began to have conflicts with the church. Anti-clerical
discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist
"<a   href="André_Lorulot.md" class="wikilink" title="André Lorulot">"André
Lorulot</a>, had its impacts in Spanish individualist anarchist
publications. There was an attack on institutionalized religion for the
responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its
irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and
scientific progress.[^16]

In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines *Ética* and
*"<a   href="Iniciales.md" class="wikilink" title="Iniciales">"Iniciales</a>*
there was a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually
linked to a certain
"<a   href="atheist.md" class="wikilink" title="atheist">"atheist</a> and
"<a   href="anti-theist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-theist">"anti-theist</a> obsession, philosophy which also
worked for pointing out the incompatibility between science and
religion, faith and reason. There was much discussion on Darwin's
theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.[^17]

"<a   href="Anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish anarchists">"Spanish anarchists</a> in the early 20th
century were responsible for burning several churches, though many of
the church burnings were carried out by members of the Radical
Republican Party, while anarchists were blamed. Church leaders' implicit
or explicit support for the Nationalist Faction during the
"<a   href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">"Spanish Civil War</a> greatly contributed to
the anti-religious sentiment.

In *Anarchism: What It Really Stands For*,
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a> wrote:

"Anarchism has declared war on the pernicious influences which have so
far prevented the harmonious blending of individual and social
instincts, the individual and society. Religion, the dominion of the
human mind; Property, the dominion of human needs; and Government, the
dominion of human conduct, represent the stronghold of man's enslavement
and all the horrors it entails."[^18]

"<a   href="Anarchism_in_China.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese anarchists">"Chinese anarchists</a> led the opposition to
Christianity in the early 20th century, but the most prominent of them,
"<a   href="Li_Shizeng.md" class="wikilink" title="Li Shizeng">"Li Shizeng</a>,
made it clear that he opposed not only Christianity but all religions as
such. When he became president of the Anti-Christian Movement of 1922,
he told the Beijing Atheists' League: "Religion is intrinsically old and
corrupt: history has passed it by" and asked, "Why are we of the
twentieth century even debating this nonsense from primitive ages?"[^19]

## Religious Anarchism

### Buddhism

Many Westerners who call themselves Buddhists regard the
"<a   href="Buddhism.md" class="wikilink" title="Buddhist">"Buddhist</a>
tradition, in contrast to most other world faiths, as nontheistic,
humanistic, and experientially-based. Most Buddhist schools see the
Buddha as the embodied proof that transcendence and ultimate happiness
is possible for all, without exception.

The Indian revolutionary and self-declared atheist
"<a   href="Har_Dayal.md" class="wikilink" title="Har Dayal">"Har Dayal</a>,
much influenced by "<a   href="Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Marx">"Marx</a>
and Bakunin, who sought to expel British rule from the subcontinent, was
a striking instance of someone who, in the early 20th century, tried to
synthesize anarchist and Buddhist ideas. Having moved to the United
States in 1912, he went so far as to establish the Bakunin Institute of
California in
"<a   href="Oakland.md" class="wikilink" title="Oakland">"Oakland</a>, which he
described as "the first monastery of anarchism".[^20][^21]

Zen priest and critic Hakugen Ichikawa, in his condemnation of Buddhist
support for "<a   href="Japanese_imperialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Japanese imperialism">"Japanese imperialism</a> in Asia, once
concluded that "if Buddhism is to possess social thought, it will have
to take the form of B-A-C, Buddhism-Anarchism-Communism."[^22] Later in
his career, he returned to this position, reframing it as
"Śūnya-anarchism-communism", where
"<a   href="Śūnya.md" class="wikilink" title="Śūnya">"Śūnya</a> means "the
vertical foundation of both the subjectivity that engages in social
revolution and, in terms of that subjectivity's basic choices, the
humble and open spirit that has been purified from dogmatism,
self-absolutism and the will to power." For Hakugen, Śūnya represents a
"vertical, existential freedom, whereas anarchism and communism pertain
to horizontal freedom, and the 'origin' is the point where the two
dimensions of freedom intersect."[^23]

"<a   href="Bhante_Sujato.md" class="wikilink" title="Bhante Sujato">"Bhante
Sujato</a>, one of the leading
"<a   href="Theravada.md" class="wikilink" title="Theravada">"Theravada</a>
representatives in Australia considers himself an
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>. In
a Buddhist speech entitled *I am an Anarchist* for Dhammanet, Sujato
states his anarchist ideology, specifically aligning himself with
"<a   href="anarcho-pacifism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-pacifism">"anarcho-pacifism</a>, which he explains as
being compatible with The Buddha, Buddhist lay and renunciant life, as
well as being in accord with the monastic *vinaya*. In the speech,
Sujato explains his belief that The Buddha was also an anarchist.[^24]

### Christianity

*Main article: "<a   href="Christian_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian Anarchism">"Christian Anarchism</a>*

According to some, "<a   href="Christianity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christianity">"Christianity</a> began primarily as a pacifist and
anarchist movement. Christian anarchists argue that Jesus came to
empower individuals and free people from oppressive religious standards,
teaching that the only rightful authority was God, not Man.

For more information on Christian anarchist theory and practice, see
"<a   href="Christian_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian Anarchism">"Christian Anarchism</a>.

### Islam

The Bedouin nomads of the
"<a   href="Khawarij.md" class="wikilink" title="Khawarij">"Khawarij</a> were
Islam's first sect. They challenged the new centralization of power in
the Islamic state as an impediment to their tribe's freedom.[^25]

At least one sect of Khawarij, the Najdat, believed that if no suitable
imam was present in the community, the position could be dispensed
with.[^26] A strand of Muʿtazili thought paralleled that of the Najdat:
if rulers inevitably became tyrants, the only acceptable course of
action was to depose them.[^27] The Nukkari subsect of Ibadi Islam
reportedly adopted a similar belief.[^28]

### Judaism

*Main article: "<a   href="Jewish_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jewish Anarchism">"Jewish Anarchism</a>*

For more information on Jewish anarchist theory and practice, see
"<a   href="Jewish_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jewish Anarchism">"Jewish Anarchism</a>.

### Taoism

Many early Taoists, such as the influential
"<a   href="Laozi.md" class="wikilink" title="Laozi">"Laozi</a> and
"<a   href="Zhuang_Zhou.md" class="wikilink" title="Zhuangzi">"Zhuangzi</a>,
were critical of authority and advised rulers that the less controlling
they were, the more stable and effective their rule would be. However,
there are parts of Laozi's
"<a   href="Tao_Te_Ching.md" class="wikilink" title="Tao Te Ching">"Tao Te
Ching</a> where an at least stateless, if not anarchistic, viewpoint is
more apparent.

In chapter 29 it is stated:

*Trying to control the world? I see you won't succeed. The world is a
spiritual vessel and cannot be controlled. Those who control, fail.*

In Chapter 53:

*Granaries are empty, but the nobles' clothes are gorgeous, their belts
show off swords, and they are glutted with food and drink. Personal
wealth is excessive. This is called thieves' endowment, but it is not
"<a   href="Tao.md" class="wikilink" title="Tao">"Tao</a>.*

In chapter 57:

*The Sage says...I enjoy serenity and people govern themselves.*

In Chapter 66:

*Those who would lead must speak as if they are behind*

In Chapter 68:

*The most effective leader takes the lowest place*

In Chapter 72:

*When people are not in awe of power, power becomes great.*[^29]

There is still debate among contemporary anarchists about whether or not
this counts as an anarchist view.[^30] It is known, however, that some
less influential Taoists, such as
"<a   href="Bao_Jingyan.md" class="wikilink" title="Bao Jingyan">"Bao
Jingyan</a>, explicitly advocated anarchy.[^31]
