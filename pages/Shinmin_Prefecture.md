From 1929 to 1931, two million Korean migrants ran an autonomous,
Anarchist zone in Shinmin, a rural province in Manchuria (in China)
across the border from Korea. Residents made decisions at village
assemblies, which confederated into district councils and area
councils.[^1] The confederation, known as the Korean People’s
Association in Manchuria (KPAM), had administrative departments that
assisted with agriculture, education, finance, military affairs, and
health. Staff in these departments received no more than the province's
average wage. The KPAM described itself as "an independent
self-governing cooperative system of the Korean people who assembled
their full power to save our nation by struggling against Japan".[^2]

Many of Shinmin's residents had been active in Korea's March 1 Movement
against Japanese colonialism in 1919 and fled Japanese suppression by
migrating to China. There they became active in an Anarchist movement
that included the Korean Anarchist Federation in Manchuria (KAF-M), the
Korean Anarcho-Communist Federation (KACF), and a section of the Korean
Independence Association (KIA) associated with Kim Jwa-Jin, an Anarchist
military strategist sometimes compared to Nestor Makhno. These three
groups collaborated to launch the KPAM in Shinmin by August of 1929.[^3]

The Shinmin uprising had top-down origins that it tried to transcend.
The KPAM initially appointed its own staff, but it also sent teams to
organize village assemblies in order to make the structure more
democratic.[^4] The new structure "quickly gained grassroots support
because it was based on worker and community self-organisation".[^5] The
KPAM organized mutual aid banks, a primary and secondary school system,
and a militia.[^6]

The militia defended the province from Japanese and Stalinist attacks.
By the summer of 1931, Anarchists decided they could no longer defend
the war-torn province and decided to go underground.[^7] From southern
China, the KAF-M and KACF continued fighting against Japan until Japan's
defeat at the end of World War II.[^8] The Tokologo African Anarchist
Collective describes what happened next: "The American ruling class
conquered the Japanese state, and then placed Korea under American
control. A war broke out, and the country was eventually split into a
Russian- and American-backed North and South, each run by
dictators."[^9]
