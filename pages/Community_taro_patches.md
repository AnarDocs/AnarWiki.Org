In 1995, indigenous and non-indigenous farmers in Hawaii’s Waiähole
valley seized state land and planted a community-run taro patch on the
site of an ancient patch. In 1998, they helped set up a network of taro
farmers across Hawaii to rehabilitate ancient taro patches. The
following is from Jacqueline Lasky's "Indigenism, Anarchism, Feminism:
An Emerging Framework for Exploring Post-Imperial Futures".[^1]

> community taro patch was rehabilitated upon ancient loÿi,\[30\] the
> ‘community’ taro patch has multiple referents: 1) a community taro
> patch for and within the local community; 2) a community taro patch
> located within a specific locale but for the broader taro farming
> community across the islands; and 3) a community taro patch in the
> traditional Hawaiian ahupuaÿa (“valley land division”) system of
