# Brief Introduction

## History

The GNU General Public Licenses (GNU GPL, or simply GPL) are a series of
widely used free software licenses, or copyleft licenses, that guarantee
end users the freedoms to run, study, share, or modify the software.[^1]
The GPL was the first copyleft license available for general use. It was
originally written by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software
Foundation (FSF), for the GNU Project. The license grants the recipients
of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition.[^2]
The licenses in the GPL series are all copyleft licenses, which means
that any derivative work must be distributed under the same or
equivalent license terms.

Historically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular
software licenses in the free and open-source software (FOSS)
domain.[^3] Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL
include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). David A.
Wheeler argues that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the
success of Linux-based systems, giving the programmers who contributed
to the kernel assurance that their work would benefit the whole world
and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that
would not have to give anything back to the community.[^4]

## Goals

GPL protects software freedom

Ultimate goal: make sure every user has the four freedoms

- Freedom to run the software
- Freedom to study and modify the software.
- Freedom to share the software
- Freedom to distribute modified versions

Every clause in GPL was designed to uphold one of these freedoms.

- ...or, it's a compromise of drafting in "adoption v. freedom" debate

GPL is primarily a copyright license

- Software is copyrighted
- License grants key freedoms
- Requirements prohibit activities that take away freedoms

General concept: copyleft Specific implementation: GPL

17 USC section 102
