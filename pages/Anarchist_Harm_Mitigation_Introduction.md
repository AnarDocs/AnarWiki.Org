# Crimes That Would Be Eliminated or Reduced in an Anarchist Society

Many acts currently defined as "crimes" by the
<a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> would cease to
be problematic — or would be drastically reduced — in an anarchist
society, because the conditions that produce them would no longer exist.
Others, while not entirely disappearing, would occur far less frequently
once the social structures that encourage or normalise them have been
dismantled. These fall into several broad categories based on their root
causes.

## Property-Related Crime

The vast majority of property crimes have their roots in poverty,
economic insecurity, and the <a href="private_property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> system itself.

### Theft

Much theft is motivated by poverty, homelessness, unemployment, and
basic survival needs. With resources made freely available through
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
networks and
<a href="gift_economy" class="wikilink" title="gift economy">gift
economy</a> principles, the material basis for most theft disappears. As
Kropotkin observed, "the outrages typical of capitalist justice —
arresting the hungry for stealing from the wealthy — would not be
possible in a needs-based paradigm." Where desperate need no longer
exists, neither does the compulsion to take what one has been denied.

### Fraud

Complex financial deception — from insurance fraud to benefit fraud —
arises from systems in which people are excluded from resources they
need and must navigate bureaucratic gatekeepers to survive. In a society
of genuine abundance and mutual provision, the incentive structure that
produces most fraud collapses.

### Property Damage

What the state labels vandalism is often an expression of alienation and
powerlessness — a reaction to a world over which people have no
meaningful control. With genuine participation in community decisions
and collective stewardship of shared spaces, destructive expressions of
frustration would be greatly reduced.

## State-Created Crimes

Many "crimes" exist solely to maintain state power and would become
meaningless in a <a href="stateless_society" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a>.

### Immigration Violations

The criminalisation of migration by the poor exists to maintain borders,
nationalism, and the global class system. Concepts like "illegal
immigration," "failure to observe conditions of leave to remain," or
"unauthorised entry" presuppose nation-states with the power to divide
humanity by birthplace. Without such states, these categories of crime
cease to exist entirely.

### Drug Possession and Consensual Activities

So-called "victimless crimes" — drug possession, unlicensed gambling,
consensual sex work — primarily serve to justify police occupation of
working-class and poor neighbourhoods, and to extend state control over
personal behaviour. Adults in an anarchist society would be free to make
their own choices about what they put in their bodies and what
consensual activities they engage in, without state interference.

### Weapons Laws

Laws such as "possession of a bladed article" or restrictions on tools
and objects function largely to enforce the state's monopoly on
violence. Communities would determine their own approaches to shared
safety based on actual needs rather than the demands of centralised
authority.

## Economic Crimes Under Capitalism

A great deal of harmful and criminal behaviour is specific to capitalist
economic structures and would have no equivalent in a post-capitalist
society.

### Tax Evasion and Financial Crime

Without money, taxation, or capitalist financial structures, elaborate
forms of financial crime — tax avoidance, offshore fraud, money
laundering — become impossible by definition.

### Wage Theft and Labour Exploitation

Wage theft — by which employers steal from workers through unpaid hours,
illegal deductions, or below-minimum pay — is endemic under capitalism,
and causes far greater harm than most street crime. With
<a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a> and
voluntary association, exploitative labour relationships cannot exist.
Workers would not be in a position to be robbed by employers because
they would collectively control their workplaces.

## Poverty-Driven Crime

Much criminal activity stems directly from material deprivation and
social exclusion.

### Survival Crime

People steal food, shoplift essentials, and commit minor property
offences because they lack the means to survive. Where mutual aid
ensures everyone's basic needs are met, these acts of desperation become
unnecessary.

### Drug Dealing

The street drug trade is largely driven by the absence of legitimate
economic opportunity in impoverished communities. With meaningful and
dignified work available to all, and with basic needs guaranteed, the
economic incentive for participation in dangerous and exploitative drug
markets disappears.

## Sexual Violence

Sexual violence deserves particular attention, because it is sometimes
assumed to be an unchangeable feature of human nature. The evidence
suggests otherwise. Rape and sexual assault are not constants — they
vary dramatically across cultures and social structures, and their
prevalence is closely tied to specific conditions: patriarchy,
hierarchy, the objectification and commodification of people (especially
women), and the treatment of bodies and persons as property.

Several studies of pre-colonial indigenous societies — particularly
those with matrilineal or egalitarian social structures — found rates of
sexual violence dramatically lower than those found in hierarchical
societies. Historians and anthropologists working on pre-contact
indigenous North American communities have noted that societies in which
women held significant authority, community responsibilities, and
leadership roles showed markedly different patterns of gendered
violence.

Sally Roesch Wagner's *Sisters in Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)
Influence on Early American Feminists* documents how Haudenosaunee women
exercised real political authority within their communities — a social
arrangement that early Euro-American feminists found striking precisely
because it was so at odds with their own experience. Matilda Joslyn
Gage's *Woman, Church and State* (1893) similarly documented the
relatively high status of women in matriarchal and matrilineal
societies, and the connection between the rise of patriarchal
institutions and the growth of gendered violence.

Martha Bono's historical analysis of sexual violence against Native
American women, conducted at Scripps College, found that the dramatic
increase in sexual violence against indigenous women was directly tied
to the colonial process — specifically to the erosion of gender
egalitarianism and the imposition of European patriarchal
structures.[^1] Research published by Columbia University's Mailman
School of Public Health likewise concluded that prior to European
colonisation, "Native American women were honoured and important in
tribal life," and that the crisis of sexual violence affecting
indigenous communities today has its roots in the colonial destruction
of those egalitarian structures.[^2]

A review published in PMC found that in many pre-colonial indigenous
societies women "were revered, held sacred, and held great authority" —
and that it was precisely because of this authority that colonial forces
targeted them, using sexual violence as a tool of conquest and
subjugation.[^3]

What this historical record makes clear is that rape is not simply a
product of individual psychology. It is, in large part, a product of
specific social conditions: the treatment of women as property, the
normalisation of male dominance, the commodification and objectification
of bodies, and the absence of meaningful female authority in community
life. An anarchist society — one that abolishes
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
alongside all other hierarchies, that treats no person as property, and
in which all people have genuine power over their own lives and
communities — would see a profound reduction in sexual violence for the
same reasons that egalitarian pre-colonial societies did.

This is not to suggest sexual violence would disappear entirely. Some
harmful behaviour has psychological roots that no social structure alone
can address. But the cultural and structural conditions that encourage,
normalise, and reproduce rape — misogyny, objectification, hierarchy,
commercialised sexuality, the property relation applied to persons —
would be gone. What remained would be addressed through
<a href="community_accountability" class="wikilink"
title="community accountability">community accountability</a> and
<a href="transformative_justice" class="wikilink"
title="transformative justice">transformative justice</a> rather than
the adversarial, retraumatising processes of the capitalist state's
legal system.

## Authority and Hierarchy-Related Problems

Many harmful behaviours stem directly from power imbalances and the
psychological damage done by authoritarian conditioning.

### Youth "Delinquency"

Much of what is labelled youth crime results from alienation, a lack of
meaningful participation in social life, and the experience of being
treated as subordinate by adults who hold all the power. With
<a href="non-authoritarian_education" class="wikilink"
title="non-authoritarian education">non-authoritarian education</a> and
the genuine inclusion of young people as participants in community life
rather than subjects of it, anti-social behaviour among young people
would be greatly reduced.

### White-Collar and Corporate Crime

Corporate executives and wealthy individuals commit massive crimes with
minimal consequences — fraud, environmental destruction, safety
violations that kill workers, the theft of public resources. Without
corporations, extreme concentrations of wealth, or hierarchical power
structures that insulate the privileged from accountability, the social
context for such crime disappears entirely.

## The Role of Social Conditions

The transformation of social conditions addresses root causes rather
than symptoms, which is why punitive state systems — designed to manage
and contain crime rather than eliminate its causes — are so demonstrably
inadequate.

Where people have genuine economic security, they are less driven to
desperate acts. Where children are raised with respect rather than
domination, they are less likely to become adults who dominate others.
Where communities are strong, cooperative, and not atomised by
competitive individualism, harmful behaviour is less likely and more
likely to be dealt with constructively when it does occur. Where women
and other marginalised groups hold genuine authority, the conditions
that produce gendered violence do not exist.

Wilhelm Reich's analysis of authoritarianism argued that punitive
child-rearing and repressive sexual morality produced "anti-social,
perverse, and cruel secondary drives" in the population — not the free
expression of human nature, but the distorted products of domination. An
anarchist approach to child-rearing, education, and social organisation
would address these root conditions directly.

## What Would Remain

It is worth being clear that not all harmful behaviour would vanish.
Some forms of interpersonal harm have complex psychological roots that
no social structure fully eliminates. Conflicts over resources and
personal disputes would still occur. Mental health difficulties would
continue to require community attention and care.

The difference is that these would be addressed through
<a href="restorative_justice" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a>,
<a href="transformative_justice" class="wikilink"
title="transformative justice">transformative justice</a>, and
<a href="community_accountability" class="wikilink"
title="community accountability">community accountability</a> —
processes that seek to repair harm, address its causes, and reintegrate
people into community life — rather than through the punitive,
brutalising, and largely ineffective apparatus of the capitalist state's
prison system.

## Historical Examples

During periods of anarchist organisation, crime rates have often dropped
markedly:

- During the **1919 Seattle General Strike**, the absence of police and
  the presence of active community solidarity produced a remarkably
  peaceful environment. The strike committee organised its own public
  safety functions, and the city was quieter than usual.
- During the **Oaxaca Commune of 2006**, five months of community
  self-organisation maintained relative social peace, despite ongoing
  state violence directed at the movement from outside.
- In the anarchist-influenced collectives of **Revolutionary Spain
  (1936–39)**, many communities reported significant reductions in crime
  alongside improvements in living standards and communal life.
