# Crimes That Would Be Eliminated in an Anarchist Society

Many acts currently defined as "crimes" by the state would cease to be
problematic or would be drastically reduced in an anarchist society due
to the elimination of their root causes. These fall into several
categories based on what drives them.

## Property-Related Crime

The vast majority of property crimes would disappear with the abolition
of <a href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> and the implementation of
mutual aid systems.

### Theft and Fraud

- **Current problem**: Much theft is motivated by poverty, homelessness,
  unemployment, and basic survival needs
- **In anarchy**: With resources freely available through
  <a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
  networks and
  <a href="gift_economy.md" class="wikilink" title="gift economy">gift
  economy</a> principles, the material basis for most theft disappears
- **Example**: "The outrages typical of capitalist justice, such as
  arresting the hungry for stealing from the wealthy, would not be
  possible in a needs-based paradigm"

### Property Damage and Vandalism

- **Current problem**: Often expressions of frustration with alienation
  and powerlessness
- **In anarchy**: With meaningful participation in community decisions
  and control over one's environment, destructive expressions of
  alienation would be greatly reduced

## State-Created Crimes

=

Many "crimes" exist solely to maintain state power and would be
meaningless in a <a href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a>.

### Immigration Violations

- **Current problem**: Criminalizing migration by the poor maintains
  borders and class systems
- **In anarchy**: Without nation-states, concepts like "illegal
  immigration" or "failure to observe conditions of leave to remain"
  become irrelevant

### Drug Possession and Consensual Adult Activities

- **Current problem**: Victimless crimes that primarily serve to justify
  police occupation of poor neighborhoods
- **In anarchy**: Adults would be free to make their own choices about
  substances and consensual activities without state interference

### Weapons Possession

- **Current problem**: Laws like "possession of a bladed article" exist
  to maintain the state's monopoly on violence
- **In anarchy**: Communities would determine their own approaches to
  tools and weapons based on actual safety needs rather than state
  control

## Economic Crimes Under Capitalism

Crimes motivated by the economic structure of capitalism would lose
their basis.

### Tax Evasion and Financial Crimes

- **Current problem**: Complex financial crimes emerge from capitalist
  economic systems
- **In anarchy**: Without money, taxation, or capitalist financial
  structures, these categories of crime become impossible

### Labor Violations

- **Current problem**: Wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and
  exploitation are endemic under capitalism
- **In anarchy**: With
  <a href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
  title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a> and
  voluntary association, exploitative labor relationships cannot exist

## Poverty-Driven Crime

Much criminal activity stems directly from material deprivation and
social exclusion.

### Survival Crimes

- **Current problem**: People commit crimes to meet basic needs for
  food, shelter, and healthcare
- **In anarchy**: Mutual aid ensures everyone's basic needs are met,
  eliminating desperate acts of survival

### Drug Dealing

- **Current problem**: Often driven by lack of legitimate economic
  opportunities in impoverished communities
- **In anarchy**: With meaningful work available to all and basic needs
  guaranteed, the economic incentive for dangerous drug trade disappears

## Authority and Hierarchy-Related Problems

Many problematic behaviors stem from power imbalances and authoritarian
conditioning.

### Youth "Delinquency"

- **Current problem**: Much youth crime results from alienation, lack of
  meaningful participation in society, and authoritarian treatment
- **In anarchy**: With
  <a href="non-authoritarian_education.md" class="wikilink"
  title="non-authoritarian education">non-authoritarian education</a>
  and genuine inclusion of young people in community life, anti-social
  behavior would decrease dramatically

### White-Collar Crime

- **Current problem**: Corporate executives and wealthy individuals
  commit massive crimes with minimal consequences
- **In anarchy**: Without corporations, extreme wealth accumulation, or
  hierarchical power structures, the context for such crimes disappears

## Social Conditions and Crime Reduction

The transformation of social conditions would address root causes rather
than symptoms.

### Reduced Alienation

- **Current problem**: Social atomization and competitive individualism
  foster anti-social behavior
- **In anarchy**: Strong community bonds and cooperative relationships
  reduce the isolation that often leads to harmful acts

### Non-Authoritarian Child-Rearing

- **Current problem**: Authoritarian parenting and educational systems
  create "anti-social, perverse, and cruel secondary drives"
- **In anarchy**: Respectful, non-violent approaches to raising children
  would dramatically reduce future harmful behavior

### Economic Security

- **Current problem**: Economic insecurity and competition create stress
  and desperation
- **In anarchy**: With basic needs guaranteed and meaningful work
  available, much crime motivated by economic pressure disappears

## Remaining Challenges

It's important to note that not all harmful behavior would disappear:

- Some forms of <a href="domestic_violence.md" class="wikilink"
  title="domestic violence">domestic violence</a>, sexual assault, and
  interpersonal harm have complex roots beyond economic systems
- <a href="Mental_health.md" class="wikilink" title="Mental health">Mental
  health</a> issues and psychological problems would still require
  community attention
- Conflicts over resources, personal disputes, and accidents would still
  occur

However, even these remaining problems would be addressed through
<a href="community_accountability.md" class="wikilink"
title="community accountability">community accountability</a>,
<a href="restorative_justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a>, and
<a href="transformative_justice.md" class="wikilink"
title="transformative justice">transformative justice</a> approaches
rather than punitive state systems.

## Historical Examples

During periods of <a href="anarchist_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist organization">anarchist organization</a>, crime rates
have often dropped significantly:

- **1919 Seattle General Strike**: The absence of police and presence of
  community solidarity led to a remarkably peaceful environment
- **Oaxaca 2006**: During five months of autonomy, community
  self-organization maintained relative peace despite external state
  violence
