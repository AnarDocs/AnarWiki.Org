# History of the Commons in Mexico

## Overview

The commons in Mexico refers to communal land tenure systems in which
indigenous and peasant communities held land collectively rather than as
individual private property. The history spans pre-Columbian indigenous
practice through Spanish colonisation, liberal enclosure, revolutionary
reconquest, constitutional protection, neoliberal privatisation, and
ongoing resistance. The
<a href="ejido" class="wikilink" title="ejido">ejido</a> system —
Mexico's modern form of communal land tenure — was constitutionally
protected from 1917 to 1992, making Mexico's experience with the commons
distinct from most other nations. The struggle over communal land has
been central to Mexican politics for over 500 years and remains
contested today.

## Pre-Columbian Commons (Pre-1521)

Before Spanish colonisation, the diverse indigenous peoples of what is
now Mexico operated under communal land tenure systems that did not
recognise European concepts of individual ownership or alienable
property. Central Mexican societies — the Aztecs (Mexica), along with
the Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Purépecha, and hundreds of other indigenous
nations — organised land tenure around collective use rights rather than
private ownership.

A 16th-century Spanish judge in New Spain, Alonso de Zorita, documented
these systems extensively, noting that land was held by communities
(*altepetl* in Nahuatl, *cah* in Maya), individual families had use
rights but not ownership, and commons provided resources for all
community members. Zorita acknowledged considerable diversity in land
tenure across regions: "if the information he gives for one place
contradicts information in another it is due to that very
diversity."[^1]

Indigenous communities managed agricultural land (including
sophisticated chinampa raised-field agriculture), forests and woodland,
water resources and irrigation systems, hunting and fishing territories,
and sacred sites. These systems emphasised sustainable use, collective
decision-making, and obligations to both community and land.

## Spanish Colonial Period (1521–1821)

After the conquest of central Mexico, indigenous land tenure was
initially left largely intact, with the exception of lands devoted to
indigenous religion. The Spanish Crown, while claiming ultimate
sovereignty, recognised indigenous communities' right to land under the
*fundo legal* system. It also established the General Indian Court so
that individuals and communities could defend their rights against
Spanish encroachment — a legal framework that offered some protection,
though frequently violated in practice.

Spaniards applied their own terminology to indigenous community lands,
calling them *ejidos* — a term from Spanish land use traditions where
common lands surrounded towns and villages. Colonial ejidos were
subordinate to Spanish property law, vulnerable to appropriation when
declared "waste" or "abandoned," and administered through colonial
institutions rather than indigenous governance.

Despite initial protections, indigenous communities faced continuous
encroachment. When the Crown decided that lands in indigenous towns were
*baldíos* — "abandoned" or "not worked" — it rescinded indigenous
rights.[^2] This mechanism — declaring land waste to justify
appropriation — would recur throughout Mexican history.

The <a href="hacienda" class="wikilink" title="hacienda">hacienda</a>
system emerged, concentrating vast estates in Spanish and creole hands.
By independence in 1821, much indigenous land had been transferred to
large landowners, creating a growing class of landless peasants. As a
response, a number of indigenous communities sought to regain land
through rebellion — the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, central Mexico, Yucatan,
and the northwest regions of the Yaqui and Mayo all saw serious
rebellions in the 19th century. The Caste War of Yucatan and the Yaqui
Wars were lengthy conflicts, lasting into the 20th century.

## Independence and Liberal Reform (1821–1910)

Following independence from Spain in 1821, Mexican liberals sought to
modernise the economy on European models. They viewed communal
landholding as an obstacle to progress and indigenous communities'
separateness as "The Indian Problem" that prevented national
integration. The solution they identified was the breakup of communal
landholding to integrate indigenous people into the Mexican nation — on
terms set entirely by that nation's creole elite.

When the Liberals came to power in 1855, they embarked on a major reform
including the expropriation and forced sale of lands held by both the
Catholic Church and indigenous communities. The
<a href="Lerdo_Law" class="wikilink" title="Lerdo Law">Lerdo Law</a>
(*Ley Lerdo*), named after Finance Minister Miguel Lerdo de Tejada,
mandated the dissolution of all corporate landholding and the
replacement of communal tenure with individual title. Properties not
claimed within a set period could be auctioned. The Liberal Reform
incorporated the Lerdo Law into the Constitution of 1857. Ejidos were
thus legally abolished, though many continued to survive in practice.

When liberal general Porfirio Díaz took power in 1877, he intensified
land concentration. Land surveys declared vast areas "vacant" (*terrenos
baldíos*) and sold them to domestic and foreign investors. By 1910, less
than 1% of the population owned most of Mexico's land.[^3] The
dispossession of peasants created the conditions for revolution.

## The Mexican Revolution and Land Reform (1810–1920)

### Hidalgo and Morelos

The first struggle for Mexican independence included demands for
indigenous and peasant land rights. Father
<a href="Miguel_Hidalgo_y_Costilla" class="wikilink"
title="Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla">Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla</a> launched
the independence movement in September 1810, mobilising tens of
thousands of indigenous and mestizo peasants who fought not only against
Spain but for recovery of their stolen commons. Hidalgo was captured and
executed in July 1811. <a href="José_María_Morelos" class="wikilink"
title="José María Morelos">José María Morelos</a>, who continued his
cause, explicitly called for the abolition of haciendas and the
restoration of common lands to indigenous communities. When independence
arrived in 1821, however, it was the creole elite who took power. The
new Mexican government proved as enthusiastic about enclosure as the
Spanish had been.

### *Tierra y Libertad*

The <a href="Mexican_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> of 1910 was, at its
southern heart, a war for the commons.
<a href="Emiliano_Zapata" class="wikilink"
title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a>'s movement in Morelos raised
the cry of *<a href="Tierra_y_Libertad" class="wikilink"
title="Tierra y Libertad">Tierra y Libertad</a>* — Land and Freedom. His
<a href="Plan_de_Ayala" class="wikilink" title="Plan de Ayala">Plan de
Ayala</a> (1911) demanded immediate restitution of ejidos, commons, and
forests to villages; expropriation of one-third of hacienda lands for
distribution to peasants; and total expropriation of haciendas whose
owners opposed the plan.[^4]

During the Revolution, many peasants fought for the return of community
lands, most notably in Morelos under Zapata's leadership. The Zapatistas
seized over a million acres from large landowners. Zapata was
assassinated in 1919, but his vision shaped the revolutionary
constitution.

## The Ejido System Under Article 27 (1917–1991)

The <a href="Mexican_Constitution_of_1917" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Constitution of 1917">Mexican Constitution of 1917</a>,
particularly
<a href="Article_27" class="wikilink" title="Article 27">Article 27</a>,
established the most radical land reform constitution in the Western
Hemisphere at the time. It held that the nation owns all land and water,
that private property exists only by concession of the nation, that the
state has the right and obligation to redistribute land, and that
communal landholding is recognised and protected.

Peasant mobilisation during the Revolution brought about state-directed
land reform, but systematic implementation didn't begin until the 1920s.
It would not be until 1934, under President
<a href="Lázaro_Cárdenas" class="wikilink"
title="Lázaro Cárdenas">Lázaro Cárdenas</a>, that the ejido system was
fully reintroduced.[^5]

### Structure

The ejido is defined as a population nucleus made up of the set of
lands, forests, and waters of an area, along with the group of
individuals holding agrarian rights. Ejidos typically contained
individual parcels (assigned to specific *ejidatarios* for cultivation),
common land (shared forests, pastures, and water), and settlement land
for housing and community facilities.

Ejidatarios did not own the land but could use their allotted parcels
indefinitely as long as they cultivated them, and could pass their
rights to their children. Crucially, ejido land was inalienable (could
not be sold or mortgaged), non-transferable except by inheritance, and
collectively governed by community assemblies. This protected peasant
communities from losing their land to debt or market pressure.

The typical process for establishing an ejido ran as follows: landless
farmers petitioning the federal government; the government consulting
with the affected landlord; expropriation if the government approved;
and the original petitioners designated as ejidatarios with cultivation
rights.

### Governance

Ejidos were governed by a General Assembly (*Asamblea General*) in which
all ejidatarios could participate; an elected Commissariat handling
day-to-day administration; and a Vigilance Council providing oversight.
Major decisions required community agreement. Positions rotated and were
unpaid, conceived as service to the community rather than sources of
power or income.

### Scale

By the time of the 1992 reforms, nearly 29,000 ejidos held over 90
million hectares — 46% of Mexico's territory. Approximately half of
Mexico's agricultural land was held communally, and 80% of Mexico's
remaining forests were in ejido or indigenous community lands. Millions
of peasant families depended on ejido land for survival.[^6]

### Contradictions

The ejido system was not without problems. Corruption in the rural
credit bank (Banrural), unequal distribution of land quality, caciques
(political bosses) manipulating local governance, and limited access to
capital and technology all created real difficulties. However, defenders
of the system argued these problems resulted from government neglect and
active sabotage rather than inherent flaws in communal tenure — a
distinction that would matter when those same problems were used to
justify privatisation.

## NAFTA and the End of Land Reform (1991–1994)

In preparation for the
<a href="North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement_(NAFTA)" class="wikilink"
title="North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)">North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</a>, President
<a href="Carlos_Salinas_de_Gortari" class="wikilink"
title="Carlos Salinas de Gortari">Carlos Salinas de Gortari</a>
undertook radical reforms to Article 27 in 1991–1992. He declared the
end of awarding ejidos and allowed existing ejidos to be rented or sold,
ending 76 years of constitutional protection for communal land.

The 1992 amendments ended the state's obligation to redistribute land,
allowed ejido land to be privatised, permitted sale, rental, and
mortgaging of ejido land, and opened it to corporate ownership. The
justifications offered were familiar: ejido land was less productive
than private land, privatisation would modernise agriculture, individual
ownership would create incentives for improvement. Critics pointed out
that agricultural research favoured large commercial operations, that
ejido land was often of lower quality, and that the reforms served
NAFTA's requirements rather than peasant needs.

The reforms potentially affected 28,000 ejidos covering roughly half of
Mexico's farmland, millions of peasant families, and indigenous
communities whose territories were held as ejidos or *bienes comunales*.
The Zapatistas called NAFTA "a death certificate for the Indian and
peasant peoples of Mexico."[^7]

## The Zapatista Uprising and Autonomous Commons (1994–Present)

On New Year's Day 1994, the
<a href="Ejército_Zapatista_de_Liberación_Nacional_(EZLN)"
class="wikilink"
title="Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN)">Ejército
Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN)</a> rose in Chiapas, Mexico's
southernmost and poorest state — timing the uprising to begin the very
day NAFTA took effect. Thousands of EZLN members occupied towns and
cities in Chiapas, burning down police stations, occupying government
buildings, and skirmishing with the Mexican army. They demanded "work,
land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom,
democracy, justice, and peace."

The EZLN takes its name from Emiliano Zapata, the agrarian revolutionary
and commander of the Liberation Army of the South during the Mexican
Revolution. The First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle identified 500
years of land dispossession as the root of their rebellion, explicitly
linking the 1992 reforms to the entire history of enclosure from Spanish
colonisation onward. The Zapatistas seized over a million acres from
large landowners during the uprising.

### Building Autonomy

After a 12-day war and fragile ceasefire, the Zapatistas began
constructing autonomous governance. The San Andrés Accords of 1996
promised indigenous autonomy and land rights, but the Mexican government
never implemented them. The Zapatistas built autonomy in practice
instead.

In August 1994, to hold the National Democratic Convention, the
Zapatista communities built the first *Aguascalientes* — a space for
dialogue and encounter between the Zapatistas and national and
international civil society, named after the historic 1914 convention
where Zapata and Pancho Villa met during the Revolution.

On 9 August 2003, the EZLN announced the creation of the **Caracoles**
(snails) and the **Juntas de Buen Gobierno** (Councils of Good
Government), replacing the Aguascalientes. The name carried symbolic
meaning: Caracoles serve as "windows to see us inside and for us to see
outside," and "megaphones to get our word out and to hear the ones far
away."[^8] Five Caracoles were established, each housing a Junta de Buen
Gobierno.

### Governance Principles

Within the autonomous municipalities, popular assemblies of around 300
families — in which anyone over the age of twelve could participate —
strove to reach consensus, falling back on majority vote when needed.
The system operated on the principle of *mandar obedeciendo* (governing
by obeying): authorities serve rather than rule. Leadership positions
rotate regularly. Communities can recall representatives who fail to
serve. Authority positions are unpaid. Resistance means not accepting
government projects or money.

### What Was Built

Without government funding, through collective labour and international
solidarity, the autonomous communities constructed two hospitals,
eighteen clinics, and around 800 community health houses across five
regions, with no fewer than 500 trained health promoters. In education,
around 300 schools and 1,000 educational promoters made up the Zapatista
Rebel Autonomous Education System, alongside a secondary education
centre at Oventic.[^9]

Land recovered from haciendas was held collectively, resources managed
through community assemblies, production organised cooperatively, and
indigenous languages and cultures revitalised. The Zapatista territories
functioned as living commons — demonstrating that the commons could be
defended and rebuilt even against sustained state opposition.

### 2023 Reorganisation

In November 2023, a communiqué signed by Subcomandante Moisés announced
the dissolution of the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities and
their Councils of Good Government. This was not an abandonment of
autonomy but a reorganisation in response to increasing cartel violence
in Chiapas and a desire to push decision-making even further to the
local level. Caracoles would remain open to local communities. The
struggle continues in new forms.

## Contemporary Status

Mexico today has three main forms of rural land tenure: ejidos
(approximately 29,000, covering roughly 51% of national territory),
indigenous communities (*comunidades indígenas* or *bienes comunales*,
based on pre-existing indigenous communities with stronger cultural and
linguistic identity), and private property. Ejidos and indigenous
communities contain 80% of Mexico's remaining forest.

Despite constitutional protection, communal lands face illegal sales and
transfers, pressure to privatise for development projects, mining and
resource extraction on community lands, tourism development displacing
communities, and environmental destruction. Research has shown that
community-managed forests in Mexico are often better protected than
state reserves or private holdings — vindicating
<a href="Elinor_Ostrom" class="wikilink" title="Elinor Ostrom">Elinor
Ostrom</a>'s work demonstrating that commons are sophisticated
governance systems capable of managing resources sustainably over
centuries.[^10]

Communities continue defending the commons through legal challenges to
privatisation, direct action against extractive projects, coalition
building through the National Indigenous Congress, international
solidarity campaigns, and maintenance of autonomous governance.

## Types of Communal Land Tenure

**Ejidos** are post-revolutionary communities created through land
redistribution under Article 27. They combine individual parcels with
collective common land and are governed by elected councils and
assemblies. Originally inalienable, they were opened to privatisation by
the 1992 reforms.

**Comunidades indígenas / bienes comunales** are indigenous communities
with land rights predating the Revolution. They are often entirely
collective (no individual parcels), maintain stronger cultural and
linguistic identity, and connect traditional governance systems to
indigenous autonomy struggles. They are based on pre-existing indigenous
communities rather than revolutionary land grants.

Both systems protect communal land from privatisation (though weakened
since 1992), are governed by assemblies, manage resources collectively,
and face similar threats. The key distinction is that *bienes comunales*
are explicitly indigenous and often maintain pre-colonial governance
traditions more completely than ejidos.
