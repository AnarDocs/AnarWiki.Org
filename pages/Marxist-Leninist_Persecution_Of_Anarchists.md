# Persecution of Anarchists in Marxist-Leninist States

The **persecution of anarchists in Marxist-Leninist states** includes
the systematic repression, imprisonment, and execution of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>
and anarchist organizations by governments claiming to follow
"<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">"Marxist-Leninist</a> ideology. This persecution
occurred across multiple continents throughout the 20th century,
beginning with the Bolshevik suppression of anarchist movements in
Soviet Russia and continuing through the Cold War era in various
communist states. The scale and documentation of this persecution varies
significantly by country, with some cases extensively recorded and
others largely obscured by state censorship and historical erasure.

The ideological conflict between anarchism and Marxism-Leninism has
roots in the 19th century split within the
"<a   href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">"First International</a> between followers of
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a>.
While both movements opposed
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
and sought revolutionary transformation, they diverged fundamentally on
the role of the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a>, with
anarchists advocating for immediate abolition of state structures and
Marxist-Leninists promoting the
""<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a>" as a transitional phase. This theoretical disagreement
manifested violently once Marxist-Leninist parties seized state power,
with anarchists consistently among the first groups targeted for
suppression.

## Soviet Union

### Lenin Era (1917-1924)

The persecution of anarchists in Soviet Russia began almost immediately
after the Bolshevik seizure of power. On April 11-12, 1918, the
"<a   href="Cheka.md" class="wikilink" title="Cheka">"Cheka</a> conducted
coordinated raids on 26 anarchist centers in Moscow, killing
approximately 40 anarchists and arresting 500 more.[^1]

The suppression of the "<a   href="Makhnovist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">"Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine resulted
in numerous executions. On June 17, 1919, seven Makhnovist headquarters
officers were arrested in Kharkov on
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">"Leon
Trotsky</a>'s orders and subsequently executed, including
Mikhalev-Pavlenko, Burbyga, Oleinik, Korobko, Kostin, Polunin, and
Dobrolyubov. Yakov Ozerov, the Makhnovist chief of staff, was shot on
August 2, 1919, by the Ukrainian Cheka.[^2]

Following the September 25, 1919, bombing of the Moscow Communist Party
headquarters by the "<a   href="Underground_Anarchists.md" class="wikilink"
title="Underground Anarchists">"Underground Anarchists</a>, numerous
anarchists were killed during arrest or executed. Founders Kazimir
Kovalevich and Piotr Sobalev were killed during arrest, while seven
anarchists committed suicide by bombing when surrounded at the Kraskovo
dacha. In December 1919, eight anarchists were executed by the Moscow
Cheka.[^3]

On September 29-30, 1921, ten anarchists were shot without trial,
including prominent theorist and poet
"<a   href="Lev_Chernyi.md" class="wikilink" title="Lev Chernyi">"Lev
Chernyi</a> (Pavel Turchaninov) and revolutionary
"<a   href="Fanya_Baron.md" class="wikilink" title="Fanya Baron">"Fanya
Baron</a>, who had worked with the Makhnovists.[^4] Baron had escaped
from prison in Ryazan several months earlier and was arrested in Moscow.
According to witnesses, "she would not go submissively to her doom. She
resisted and had to be carried bodily to the place of execution."[^5]
Chernyi's body was never released to his family, leading many to
conclude he had been tortured to death.[^6]

The "<a   href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt Rebellion">"Kronstadt Rebellion</a> of March 1921
resulted in approximately 1,000 killed in battle. After the fortress
fell on March 17, 1921, it is estimated that 2,000 Kronstadt sailors
were executed, most without trial.[^7] The sailors, whom Trotsky himself
had once praised as the "adornment and pride of the revolution," had
demanded reforms including freedom of speech for workers, peasants,
anarchists and left socialist parties, and newly elected soviets free
from Bolshevik monopoly.[^8]

### Stalin Era (1924-1953)

> ‘We believe that the Anarchists are real enemies of Marxism.
> Accordingly, we also hold that a real struggle must be waged against
> real enemies.’ - ''Joseph Stalin, in Anarchism or Socialism, 1906.
>
> *(The major difference being that Leninists / Stalinists will imprison
> or kill Anarchists, but Anarchists want everyone to be free, even
> those they don’t agree with.)*

Documentation for the Stalin era is considerably worse than for the
Lenin period, as many anarchists simply "disappeared" without records.
Most died in "<a   href="Gulag.md" class="wikilink" title="Gulag">"Gulag</a>
camps from disease, starvation, and harsh conditions rather than formal
execution.

On August 12, 1937, a group of sixteen anarchists were executed in
Tobolsk, including prominent anarcho-syndicalist
"<a   href="Aron_Baron.md" class="wikilink" title="Aron Baron">"Aron Baron</a>,
husband of Fanya Baron, who had spent 17 years in prison and exile.[^9]
Executed alongside him were Prokop Budakov, Zinaida Budakova, Avram
Venetsky, Ivan Golovchanskii, Vsevolod Denisov, Nikolai Desyatkov, Ivan
Dudarin, Andrei Zolotarev, Andrei Kislitsin (born 1873), Alexander
Pastukhov, Anna Sangorodetskaya, Mikhail Tvelnev, Vladimir
Khudolei-Gradin, Yuri Hometovsky-Izgodin, and Nahum Eppelbaum. In total,
2,500 people were shot at Tobolsk in 1937-38.[^10]

At Sandarmokh, between October and November 1937, over 9,500 people were
shot as part of the
"<a   href="Great_Terror.md" class="wikilink" title="Great Terror">"Great
Terror</a>, including hundreds of anarchists and
"<a   href="Maximalists.md" class="wikilink"
title="Maximalists">"Maximalists</a>. At Solovki Camp, journalist Evgenia
Iaroslavskaia-Markon was executed in 1931. In February 1938, between
200-300 prisoners were shot at Sekirnaya Hill. At least 67 anarchists
have been positively identified as detained in the Solovki political
sections.[^11]

Prominent anarchist leaders who disappeared during this period include
Alexander Atabekian, German Askarov, Alexei Borovoi, Efim Iarchuk, and
Peter Arshinov, though precise dates and circumstances remain
unclear.[^12]

## Cuba

Following
"<a   href="Fidel_Castro.md" class="wikilink" title="Fidel Castro">"Fidel
Castro</a>'s rise to power in 1959, Cuban anarchists who had fought
alongside Castro against the
"<a   href="Fulgencio_Batista.md" class="wikilink" title="Batista">"Batista</a>
dictatorship faced systematic repression once the regime adopted
Marxism-Leninism. In December 1960, anarchist publications *El
Libertario* and *Solidaridad Gastronómica* were suppressed by the
government.[^13]

### Documented Killings

Multiple anarchists were killed by the Castro regime, including Augusto
Sánchez (imprisoned and murdered), Rolando Tamargo (shot), Ventura
Suárez (shot), Sebastian Aguilar Jr. (shot), Eusebio Otero (found dead
in his room), and Raúl Negrín (burned alive).[^14]

### Imprisonments

Numerous anarchists received lengthy prison sentences for opposing the
regime. Plácido Méndez, a bus driver who had fought against Batista and
been tortured by his regime, was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.
Alberto Garcia, Secretary of the Federation of Medical Workers, received
30 years at hard labor. José Aceña, who had served as treasurer of
Havana Province under the revolutionary government before opposing
Castro, was sentenced to 20 years.[^15]

Many imprisoned anarchists were former members of Castro's
"<a   href="26th_of_July_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="26th of July Movement">"26th of July Movement</a> who had fought
in the Sierra Escambray against Batista. The repression was facilitated
by a deceptive manifesto issued in November 1961 by Manuel Gaona Sousa,
a former anarchist, which falsely claimed anarchists supported the
Castro government and that no anarchists were being imprisoned—claims
repeatedly contradicted by anarchist publications on the island.[^16]

## People's Republic of China

The documentation of anarchists killed under Maoism (1949-1976) is
extremely limited. The Chinese anarchist movement had largely collapsed
before
"<a   href="Mao_Zedong.md" class="wikilink" title="Mao Zedong">"Mao Zedong</a>
took power in 1949, and Chinese state records remain less accessible
than Soviet archives.

Before the establishment of the People's Republic, two anarchist labor
organizers were executed in 1922 by warlord Zhao Hengti in Changsha:
Huang Ai (1897-1922) and Pang Renquan. However, this occurred before the
Communist Party controlled the region.

During the "<a   href="Cultural_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cultural Revolution">"Cultural Revolution</a> (1966-1976), an
estimated 1.6 million people died from violence directly, with 10,402
political prisoners receiving death sentences. However, victims were
typically labeled as "counterrevolutionaries," "rightists," or
"bourgeois elements" rather than specifically as anarchists. By 1949, no
organized anarchist movement remained to be targeted—most anarchists had
either joined the
"<a   href="Chinese_Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink" title="CCP">"CCP</a>,
the "<a   href="Kuomintang.md" class="wikilink" title="KMT">"KMT</a>, or been
killed in earlier conflicts.

The absence of documentation is itself significant, representing the
complete erasure of both the anarchist movement and its historical
memory under Maoist rule.

## Vietnam

The Marxist-Leninist government that came to power in Vietnam
systematically eradicated oppositional currents, labeling them as
traitors. The elaborate history of Vietnam's liberation struggle has
been reduced to a binary narrative: one was either a patriotic Stalinist
or a reactionary collaborator, effectively erasing anarchist
participation from official histories.

"<a   href="Nguyễn_An_Ninh.md" class="wikilink" title="Nguyễn An Ninh">"Nguyễn
An Ninh</a> (1900-1943), a prominent Vietnamese anarchist who
established the Nguyen An Ninh Secret Society in 1926 and advocated for
revolutionary populism based on anarchist principles, was arrested in
1926 and died in 1943, though the precise circumstances remain unclear.
By the time North Vietnam established its government, and particularly
after reunification in 1975, anarchism as an organized movement had been
suppressed, with participants either absorbed into the Communist Party,
killed, or silenced.

Contemporary Vietnamese anarchists describe being "cut off from
\[their\] roots," with many living for decades before even hearing the
word encompassing their ideas, due to the regime's successful historical
erasure.

## Eastern Europe

### Hungary

In the aftermath of World War II, as Soviet forces occupied Hungary,
anarchists faced violent repression. Four anarchist students who opened
fire on Russian troops in 1945 were killed in the ensuing gun battle. In
the factories of Csepel Island, anarchists led the only strike after
liberation from fascism; thirty workers, including 24 anarchists, were
subsequently executed. The libertarian movement in Hungary was
liquidated, with survivors fleeing to Italy and France.

### Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia

While anarchist movements existed in Eastern Europe before and during
World War II, documentation of specific persecution under communist rule
is limited. After decades of repression and vilification, anarchist
organizations only re-emerged openly in the late 1980s during the
collapse of communist regimes, including the Movement for An Alternative
Society (PSA) and Anarchist Intercity (MA) in Poland, Autonomia in
Hungary, the Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists (KAS) in the Soviet
Union, and the Anarchist Working- and Action-Circle of Mockau (AAAM) in
East Germany.

The suppression was effective enough that the movements remained largely
dormant for over four decades, suggesting systematic persecution, though
individual names and incidents remain largely undocumented in accessible
sources.

## North Korea

The Korean anarchist movement was significant during Japanese occupation
(1910-1945), with anarchists forming the Eastern Anarchist Federation
alongside comrades from China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan in 1927. The
Korean Anarchist Communist Federation was formed in November 1929 as a
national underground organization fighting Japanese imperialism.

Following the division of Korea and establishment of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea in 1948, no documentation exists of anarchist
activity or persecution. The complete absence of information likely
indicates thorough suppression of the movement, though specific victims
and circumstances remain unknown.

## African Marxist-Leninist States

### Angola and Mozambique

During the wars of independence against Portuguese colonial rule, many
Angolans and Mozambicans developed anti-authoritarian systems of
"popular power." However, once independence was achieved, the
"<a   href="MPLA.md" class="wikilink" title="MPLA">"MPLA</a> in Angola and
"<a   href="FRELIMO.md" class="wikilink" title="FRELIMO">"FRELIMO</a> in
Mozambique officially adopted Marxism-Leninism. Both governments
suppressed autonomous popular organizations in favor of centralized
state control, though documentation of specific persecution of
anarchists is lacking, likely due to the absence of organized anarchist
movements at the time of independence.

Portuguese anarcho-syndicalists had been deported to Mozambique as early
as the 1890s, with José Estevam establishing the Revolutionary League in
Lourenço Marques in the early 1900s. By the 1920s, Mozambican trade
unions had developed anarcho-syndicalist tendencies. However, following
the 1926 coup in Portugal, this nascent movement was suppressed, and
there is no evidence of organized anarchism surviving to the era of
FRELIMO's Marxist-Leninist government.

## Patterns and Documentation

The persecution of anarchists followed consistent patterns across
Marxist-Leninist states: immediate suppression upon seizure of power,
closure of anarchist publications, arrests of prominent organizers, and
either execution or lengthy imprisonment. Anarchists were frequently
among the first groups targeted, often before other opposition parties,
reflecting the particular ideological threat they posed to
state-socialist projects.

Documentation quality varies dramatically by country and era:

- **Well-documented**: USSR under Lenin (dozens of named victims with
  dates and circumstances), Cuba (specific individuals and sentences)
- **Moderately documented**: USSR under Stalin (many victims identified,
  but circumstances often unclear)
- **Poorly documented**: China under Mao, Vietnam, Eastern Europe
- **Virtually undocumented**: North Korea, most African Marxist-Leninist
  states

This variation reflects both the strength of anarchist movements before
Marxist-Leninist takeover, the openness of state archives, and
deliberate historical erasure by regimes seeking to eliminate
alternative revolutionary narratives. In many cases, the absence of
documentation itself constitutes evidence of successful suppression and
the erasure of anarchist movements from both life and historical memory.

## Historical Memory

Of the dozens of anarchists killed in the Soviet Union, only three have
Wikipedia articles in English:
"<a   href="Lev_Chernyi.md" class="wikilink" title="Lev Chernyi">"Lev
Chernyi</a>,
"<a   href="Fanya_Baron.md" class="wikilink" title="Fanya Baron">"Fanya
Baron</a>, and "<a   href="Maria_Nikiforova.md" class="wikilink"
title="Maria Nikiforova">"Maria Nikiforova</a> (who was actually killed
by White forces rather than Bolsheviks). This stark disparity between
documented victims and historical commemoration reflects the
marginalization of anarchist history within mainstream accounts of
20th-century revolutionary movements.

The persecution of anarchists by Marxist-Leninist states demonstrates a
fundamental incompatibility between anarchist principles of
decentralized, non-hierarchical organization and the Marxist-Leninist
commitment to
"<a   href="Vanguardism.md" class="wikilink" title="vanguard party">"vanguard
party</a> rule and state power. Rather than representing isolated
excesses or deviations from revolutionary principles, these persecutions
were systemic features of state-socialist regimes that viewed any
autonomous working-class organization outside party control as a threat
to their power.
