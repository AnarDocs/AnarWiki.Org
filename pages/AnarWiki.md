# AnarWiki

AnarWiki is an
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
wiki which was initially begun as a project to save the now defunct
<a href="Libertarian_Socialist_Wiki" class="wikilink"
title="Libertarian Socialist wiki">Libertarian Socialist wiki</a> page,
the <a href="Anarchy_In_Action_Wiki" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchy In Action wiki">Anarchy In Action wiki</a>, and the
<a href="Tankie:Introduction" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Tankie wiki">Anti-Tankie wiki</a>. The majority of its
articles come from those sources, but it has since begun to be
supplemented by original articles, as well as ones adapted from
<a href="Wikipedia" class="wikilink" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> and
other wikis where relevant.

The ultimate goal of AnarWiki is to be a comprehensive Anarchist wiki
with wholly original articles following a consistent style and standard
of content.

Among the original material unique to this wiki is an [introduction to
anarchism](http://Introduction%20to%20Anarchism),
