In the summer of 1831, a slave named Nat Turner convened around other
seventy slaves in South Carolina's Southampton County and launched an
uprising that, as Howard Zinn describes, "went on a rampage from
plantation to plantation, murdering at least fifty-five men, women, and
children. They gathered supporters, but were captured as their
ammunition ran out. Turner and perhaps eighteen others were hanged."[^1]

Joel Olson argues that the uprising exemplified "anarchistic tendencies"
in Black freedom struggles and that it should "clearly count as one of
the most important insurrections in American history".[^2]
