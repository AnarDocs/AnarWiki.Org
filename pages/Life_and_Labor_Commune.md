From Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works[^1]:

> It was an agricultural commune established near Moscow in 1921 by
> people following the pacifist and anarchist teachings of Leo Tolstoy.
> Its members, nearly one thousand at their peak, were at odds with the
> Soviet government on account of refusing to perform military service.
> For this reason, the commune was finally shut down by the authorities
> in 1930; but during its existence, the participants created a large
> self-organized community in peace and resistance.
