  <http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=A19BB125BE20BC10B8D614B42B4A7670>
  \[PDF, 9MB, EN\] (this was his PhD research, and he is an historian
  expert on Russian revolution, unlike Brinton, so this work is probably
  more reliable and accurate as a source. Hereâ€™s what Smith wrote via
  email: â€œMy PhD which became my first book - Red Petrogard - derives
  from my wrestling with the libertarian critique of Bolshevism. In key
  respects, my research - and I genuinely had an open mind - showed that
  Brinton and Avrich fundamentally misunderstood the factory committees,
  which only very belatedly began to dabble with ideas of worker
  self-management (being overwhelmingly concerned with not letting
  workers bear the cost of the implosion of the war economy in 1917).
  More importantly I showed - as Goodey had suggested, but not really
  worked through - that the committees were seeking to centralise their
  activities with a view to being the directing centre of something like
  a planned economy, but one rooted in workersâ€™ power. I also showed
  that Lenin - for a few months, until the scale of the collapse of the
  economy hit him - was broadly sympathetic to the concept of workersâ€™
  control. The far left uses Red Petrograd to show (correctly) how
  quickly the factory committee movement in Petrograd rallied around the
  Bolshevik cause. What they ignore is that the Bolshevik leaders showed
  scant interest in the factory committees until after October (...)â€)

### Notes

- Bukharin identifies the next stage in economic development as â€œstate
  capitalismâ€
- Lenin says state need a monopoly on capitalism to transition to
  socialism
- Many people claiming to be Marxist-Leninists donâ€™t read the works of
  their idolized authors when they try to argue with leftcoms and
  anarchists denying the existence of state capitalism
- Many MLs donâ€™t seem to know many of the bureaucrats never said their
  state was communistâ€” only transitioning to communism
- On Soviet industrialisation and economy, R.W. Davies has done
  pioneering work (books are from 1980 to 2018!), especially with his
  series (partly with Stephen Wheatcroft)
