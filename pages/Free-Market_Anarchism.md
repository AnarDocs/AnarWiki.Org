# Market Anarchism

**Market anarchism**[^1] is the branch of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
that advocates a "<a   href="free-market.md" class="wikilink"
title="free-market">free-market</a> economic system based on voluntary
interactions without the involvement of the state; a form of
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>.[^2][^3]

Due to contending definitions of the terms 'markets' and 'capitalism'
which are not used by free-market anti-capitalists,[^4][^5][^6]
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> has been referred to
synonymously as "free-market anarchism," but the ideologies differ
significantly.[^7][^8][^9][^10]

The "<a   href="Center_for_a_Stateless_Society.md" class="wikilink"
title="Center for a Stateless Society">Center for a Stateless
Society</a> (C4SS), which
"<a   href="Kevin_Carson.md" class="wikilink" title="Kevin Carson">Kevin
Carson</a> is associated with, is one such group of free-market
anti-capitalists.[^11] As is
"<a   href="Samuel_Edward_Konkin_III.md" class="wikilink"
title="Samuel Edward Konkin III">Samuel Edward Konkin III</a>'s
"<a   href="agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="agorism">agorism</a>, a
tendency associated with left-libertarianism.[^12]

## Criticism and Terminology

Some anarchist writers, such as
"<a   href="Iain_McKay.md" class="wikilink" title="Iain McKay">Iain McKay</a>,
have been skeptical of this conceptual nomenclature on the grounds that
it still leads to misunderstandings about its similarity to
anarcho-capitalists.[^13][^14]

McKay suggests that
"<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">mutualism</a> is
a preferable term, following
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>'s original
usage, as it more clearly distinguishes genuinely anarchist approaches
to markets from right-wing appropriations of anarchist terminology.

    about 'Free Market Anticapitalism,' the obvious points where
    clarification may be needed are going to be the meaning of
    capitalism, the meaning of markets, and the meaning of freedom in
    the market context... market anarchists have spent a lot of
    time...the possibility of disentangling multiple senses of
    'capitalism'...The meaning of the term is obviously central to any
    free market economics...Pro-capitalist economists have often
    suggested such a broad understanding of 'markets' even if they have
    not fully understood...its implications."

    individualist anarchist, including agorism and mutualism, often with

    "It would be tempting to call such a system of market co-operatives
    'market anarchism' in the same way that Schweickart's calls his
    similar system market socialism, but that would be unwise. This is
    because 'anarcho'-capitalists have appropriated that term in a
    rebranding exercise for their own ideology. (...) Best, I think, to
    call it mutualism, as Proudhon did — that would make it extremely
    difficult for the propertarian right to appropriate it."

    <https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/blog/afaq-version-157.html> "Some
    have starting using the term 'market anarchism' to describe
    Individualist Anarchism and mutualism. This can be considered as an
    equivalent of 'market socialism' but the problem is that the term
    can be used by 'anarcho'-capitalists in yet another attempt to
    smuggle their authoritarian ideology into anarchist circles."
