# Mutual Aid

## Overview

**Mutual aid** is an organizational model where voluntary, collaborative
exchanges of resources and services for common benefit take place
amongst community members to overcome social, economic, and political
barriers to meeting common needs. This can include physical resources
like food, clothing, or medicine, as well as services like breakfast
programs or education. These groups are often built for the daily needs
of their communities, but mutual aid groups are also found throughout
relief efforts, such as in natural disasters or pandemics.

Resources are shared unconditionally, contrasting this model from
"<a   href="charity.md" class="wikilink" title="charity">charity</a> where
conditions for gaining access to help are often set, such as means
testing or grant stipulations. These groups often go beyond material or
service exchange and are set up as a form of political participation in
which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing
political conditions.

Mutual aid groups are distinct in their drive to flatten hierarchy,
searching for collective consensus decision-making across participating
people rather than placing leadership within a closed executive team.
With this joint decision-making, all participating members are empowered
to enact change and take responsibility for the group.

## Origins

The term "mutual aid" was popularized by the anarchist philosopher
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> in his essay collection
*"<a   href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution</a>* (1902), which argued that cooperation, not competition,
was the driving mechanism behind evolution, through biological
mutualism.[^1][^2]

Kropotkin argued that mutual aid has pragmatic advantages for the
survival of humans and animals and has been promoted through natural
selection, and that mutual aid is arguably as ancient as human
culture.[^3] This recognition of the widespread character and individual
benefit of mutual aid stood in contrast to the theories of social
Darwinism that emphasized individual competition and survival of the
fittest.

Kropotkin's work drew on observations of both animal behavior and human
societies throughout history, demonstrating that cooperation was a
fundamental driver of evolution and social progress. His theory provided
a scientific and philosophical foundation for anarchist organizing
principles that continue to influence mutual aid practice today.

## Tendencies

### Core Principles

Mutual aid participants work together to figure out strategies and
resources to meet each other's needs, such as food, housing, medical
care, and disaster relief while organizing themselves against the system
that created the shortage in the first place.[^4]

Typically, mutual-aid groups are member-led, member-organized, and open
to all to participate in. They often have non-hierarchical,
non-bureaucratic structures, with members controlling all resources.
They are egalitarian in nature and designed to support participatory
democracy, equality of member status, power-shared leadership, and
consensus-based decision-making.[^5]

### Historical Forms

In the 1800s and early 1900s, mutual aid organizations included unions,
the "<a   href="friendly_societies.md" class="wikilink"
title="friendly societies">friendly societies</a> that were common
throughout Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,[^6]
medieval craft guilds,[^7] the American fraternity societies that
existed during the Great Depression providing their members with health
and life insurance and funeral benefits,[^8] and the English working
men's clubs of the 1930s that also provided health insurance.[^9]

### Marginalized Communities

In the United States, mutual aid has been practiced extensively in
marginalized communities, notably in Black communities, working-class
neighborhoods, migrant groups, LGBT communities, and
others.[^10][^11][^12][^13]

The "<a   href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>'s urban food
programs in the 1960s were a prominent example of mutual aid in action.
During the AIDS crisis in the United States, many LGBT+ groups started
mutual aid networks to provide medical care, support groups, and
political activism when the government chose to ignore the
community.[^14]

### Contemporary Practice

"<a   href="Common_Ground_Relief.md" class="wikilink"
title="Common Ground Relief">Common Ground Relief</a> organized mutual
aid for disaster relief during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina, demonstrating
the power of decentralized organizing in crisis response.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mutual aid and grassroots solidarity
groups around the world organized distribution networks for food and
personal protective equipment.[^15] The term "mutual aid", previously
associated with anarchism, drifted into public parlance during the
pandemic. Local mutual aid groups, sometimes as local as the street
level, organized to help shop, deliver medicine, create games for kids,
offering civic connection during a time of isolation.[^16]

Around the same time, the "<a   href="Black_Lives_Matter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Lives Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> movement resulted in
multiple protestors detained and arrested by police.[^17] Bail funds,
which are community organizations that pay cash bail for people in need
for free, are another example of mutual aid organizations.[^18]

## Criticism

Some challenges to the success of mutual aid groups include lack of
technical experts, lack of funding, lack of public legitimacy,[^19] and
institutionalization of social hierarchies.[^20]

From a revolutionary perspective, some critics argue that mutual aid can
become reformist if it focuses solely on meeting immediate needs without
challenging the underlying systems of oppression. The key distinction,
as emphasized by many anarchist organizers, is that mutual aid must be
practiced alongside efforts to dismantle hierarchical systems rather
than simply filling gaps left by the state.
