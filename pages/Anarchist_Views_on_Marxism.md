# Anarchist Views on Marxism

## Overview

The relationship between
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> and
"<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> has been
complex and often contentious since the mid-19th century. While both
emerged from the same historical context of opposition to
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and shared certain goals, anarchists have developed substantial
critiques of Marxist theory and practice.

A fundamental distinction exists between the two philosophies: Marxism
primarily constitutes an economic philosophy focused on critiquing
capitalism through "<a   href="historical_materialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="historical materialism">historical materialism</a>, while
anarchism is fundamentally a political philosophy concerned with
opposing
"<a   href="hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a> in
all forms. This difference in focus means that many anarchists
appreciate Marx's economic analysis of capitalism while rejecting
Marxist prescriptions for revolutionary organisation and the
post-revolutionary period.

## Historical Development

### Early Interactions

Anarchism and Marxism both originated in 19th century movements for
democracy, socialism, and working class liberation. As Wayne Price
notes, they "drank at the same proletarian spring" and initially shared
common goals.[^1]

"<a   href="Michael_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Michael Bakunin">Michael Bakunin</a>, despite his fierce
conflicts with
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>,
respected Marx's scientific abilities and even began translating the
first volume of
"<a   href="Capital.md" class="wikilink" title="Capital">Capital</a> into
Russian. Similarly, the Italian anarchist
"<a   href="Carlo_Cafiero.md" class="wikilink" title="Carlo Cafiero">Carlo
Cafiero</a> published a summary of Capital.[^2]

However, the relationship soured dramatically during the
"<a   href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a> (1864-1872), where
Marx and Bakunin's factions came into bitter conflict over questions of
organisation, strategy, and the role of the state. This culminated in
the expulsion of Bakunin and his supporters at the Hague Congress of
1872, effectively splitting the international workers' movement.

### The Great Divide

The "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> and subsequent
"<a   href="Bolshevik.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>
policies deepened the divide between anarchists and Marxist-Leninists.
The Bolshevik suppression of anarchists, the crushing of the
"<a   href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt Rebellion">Kronstadt Rebellion</a>, and the liquidation
of the "<a   href="Makhnovist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> demonstrated in
practice what anarchists had warned about in theory: that
Marxist-Leninist methods would lead to authoritarian dictatorship rather
than workers' liberation.[^3]

This historical experience of Marxist-Leninist hostility - including the
imprisonment, exile, and
"<a   href="Marxist-Leninist_Persecution_Of_Anarchists.md" class="wikilink"
title="execution of anarchists">execution of anarchists</a> in the
Soviet Union and elsewhere - has created lasting divisions within the
revolutionary left.

## Areas of Agreement

Despite profound disagreements, anarchists and Marxists share certain
analytical frameworks and goals:

**Materialist Analysis**: Both traditions employ materialist analysis,
recognising that ideas and social structures are shaped by economic and
social conditions, though anarchists reject rigid
"<a   href="economic_determinism.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic determinism">economic determinism</a>.[^4]

**Critique of Capitalism**: Many anarchists find Marx's economic
analysis of capitalism valuable. As Errico Malatesta observed, "almost
all the anarchist literature of the 19th century was impregnated with
Marxism."[^5]

**Class Struggle**: Both traditions recognise the importance of working
class struggle, though they differ significantly on how such struggles
should be organised and led.

**Ultimate Goals**: Both originally aimed for a classless, stateless
society based on common ownership of the means of production.

## Fundamental Disagreements

### The State

The most fundamental disagreement concerns the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>. While both
traditions claim to seek the abolition of the state, Marxists advocate
for the establishment of a "workers' state" or "dictatorship of the
proletariat" as a transitional phase. Anarchists reject this entirely,
arguing that:

- The state is inherently a centralised, hierarchical institution
  designed for minority rule
- A "workers' state" inevitably becomes the dictatorship of a party over
  the working class
- The state will not "wither away" but will entrench new forms of
  domination
- Post-revolutionary society should be organised through federations of
  workers' councils and communes from the beginning

Bakunin predicted with remarkable accuracy: "The new social order should
not be organised by the free association of peoples' organisations or
unions, local and regional, from the bottom up in accordance with the
demands and instincts of the people, but by the dictatorial power of the
learned minority which presumes to express the will of the people."[^6]

### Vanguardism and Party Organisation

Anarchists reject the
"<a   href="Leninist.md" class="wikilink" title="Leninist">Leninist</a>
concept of the
"<a   href="Vanguardism.md" class="wikilink" title="vanguard party">vanguard
party</a> - a centralised, hierarchical party of professional
revolutionaries that claims the right to lead the working class. They
argue that:

- Workers can and must organise themselves directly
- A hierarchical party reproduces the very structures of domination it
  claims to oppose
- Party dictatorship is incompatible with workers' self-management
- Revolutionary organisations should be federalist, not centralist

As the Workers Solidarity Movement notes, anarchists oppose "the
Leninist top-down vision of socialism" and reject the premise that
workers can only achieve "trade union consciousness" without guidance
from intellectuals.[^7]

### Economic Determinism

Anarchists reject Marxist
"<a   href="economic_determinism.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic determinism">economic determinism</a> - the theory that
economic structures are the ultimate determinant of all social,
political, and ideological phenomena. Bakunin argued that Marx "takes no
account of other factors in history such as the ever-present reaction of
political, juridical and religious institutions on the economic
situation."[^8]

Anarchists emphasise:

- The independent role of the state as not merely a tool of the ruling
  class but a power structure in its own right
- The importance of culture, psychology, and human will in shaping
  history
- That causes and effects continuously interact rather than flowing in
  one direction
- The dangers of historical determinism in undermining revolutionary
  agency

### Revolutionary Strategy

Anarchists advocate
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>, "<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>, and
building alternative institutions in the present, while many Marxists
have emphasised:

- Electoral participation and parliamentary strategies
- Centralised planning and nationalisation
- Postponing workers' control until after the seizure of state power
- Supporting "progressive" capitalist development as a necessary stage

Anarchists argue these strategies have repeatedly led to the co-option
of revolutionary movements and the creation of new forms of oppression.

## Libertarian Marxism

Not all Marxists have followed the authoritarian path. Libertarian or
autonomist Marxist tendencies - including
"<a   href="council_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="council communism">council communism</a>, certain strands of
"<a   href="Situationism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationism">Situationism</a>, and autonomous Marxism - share
significant overlap with anarchism. Figures like
"<a   href="Rosa_Luxemburg.md" class="wikilink" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa
Luxemburg</a>, while nominally Marxist, developed theories of
revolutionary spontaneity and workers' councils that closely paralleled
anarchist positions.[^9]

Daniel Guérin argued that "a synthesis of anarchism and Marxism is not
only necessary but inevitable," proposing a "libertarian communism" that
draws on both traditions.[^10]

## Contemporary Perspectives

Modern anarchists maintain that while Marx's economic analysis may offer
useful insights, anarchists are no more obliged to master Marxist theory
than a biologist is required to study sociology. Both may be valuable,
and they may overlap in places, but they are fundamentally different
fields of inquiry. Marxism cannot refute anarchism because they address
different questions: one primarily concerns the economic structure of
capitalism, the other concerns the political structures of domination
and how to organise society without hierarchy.

As Thom Holterman argues, much of what Marx predicted based on his
supposedly scientific method "didn't come to pass," and the premise that
"<a   href="Dialectics.md" class="wikilink"
title="dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a> enables one
to predict the future "shouldn't claim that he developed a scientific
method for understanding the capitalist system and infallibly predicting
the future."[^11]

Contemporary anarchists recognise that Marxist-Leninist experiments in
state socialism have consistently produced authoritarian, often
totalitarian regimes that murdered millions while failing to abolish
either capitalism or the state. This historical record vindicates the
anarchist critique while demonstrating that libertarian alternatives are
necessary.

## Criticism

Some anarchists argue that any engagement with Marxism risks co-option
or confusion. Others maintain that anarchists should study Marxist
economic analysis while rejecting its political conclusions. Still
others, like Gaston Leval, have produced detailed critiques arguing that
Marxist theory fundamentally misunderstands historical development, the
nature of the state, and the possibilities for revolutionary
transformation.[^12]
