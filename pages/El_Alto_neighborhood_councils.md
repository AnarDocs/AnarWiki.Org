Over a million people[^1] live in the Bolivian city of El Alto, mostly
indigenous Aymarans whose families have migrated from the countryside
over the past few decades. With the state providing the city with very
little infrastructure, residents have found ways to govern their own
affairs and manage their own economy through neighborhood councils and
unions, especially in the 2000s. Autonomous organizing and
self-management had significantly declined by 2016, reports researcher
Angus McNelly, due to the government's combination of co-option and
carrot-and-stick economic measures.[^2]

# Decisions

Between 500 and 600 neighborhood councils make decisions and confederate
into the Federation of Neighborhood Councils (FEJUVE), which meets
monthly. Regular decisions are made by voting, but very important
decisions require consensus. Positions of political representation are
“compulsory and by rotation.”[^3] Each neighborhood council has about
200 members. Peter Gelderloos notes, “More men than women sit on these
committees; however a greater percentage of women take on leadership
roles in FEJUVE than in other Bolivian popular organizations.”[^4]

# Economy

Neighoborhood councils organize families to get electricity and water,
build sewers, streets and sidewalks, and construct public goods like
parks and schools. Parent's committees manage education of the youth.
Communities run a preventative health clinic, based in traditional and
herbal medicines.[^5]. The neighborhood councils have taken the lead in
building a public university in El Alto.[^6] Collective goods are
usufructory, meaning any individual or family can acquire them simply by
using them.[^7]

The main economic unit in El Alto is the family. The majority of workers
are able to rotate from one job to another, and thus avoid extreme
division of labor. Raúl Zibechi argues that adult men experience no
economic exploitation or alienated labor, but women and children are
still subjugated within their communities.[^8]

Many families sell meat, bread and other groceries at market stalls
managed by the unions. [^9] The *New York Times* describes the large
market:

> Here vendors by the thousands offer a huge array of goods: piles of
> used T-shirts and other clothing that arrive in bales from the United
> States; cars, new or used (and sometimes stolen); neatly arranged
> arms, legs and heads from broken Barbie dolls; electric guitars;
> mummified baby llamas; pickax handles; and myriad other items. Each
> week, millions of dollars pour through the market, which operates in
> an almost total vacuum of government intervention, taxes or
> regulations.[^10]

Due to the lack of state regulation, some observers consider El Alto's
economy a prime example of neoliberalism.[^11]

# Environment

# Crime

In El Alto, the state police are often an accomplice to thieves, rapists
and attackers. Neighborhood councils therefore consider recourse to the
state justice system “unthinkable.” When possible, the councils resolve
conflicts between neighbors. [^12]

Collective self-defense groups hang dolls outside houses that have been
robbed, as a symbolic warning to thieves that they will be killed when
they are caught. Residents sometimes do kill thieves upon catching them.
Zibechi writes, “There is no question that this form of 'El Alto
justice' is too drastic,” but residents are still looking for other
options. If a thief is expelled, he sometimes comes back the next day,
with police on his side, seeking revenge on those who expelled him.
Police and thieves infiltrate community justice meetings and take
revenge on residents based on what they say at the meetings.[^13]

Zibechi posits that rural Aymaran traditions of community justice “may
in time come to fruition in the cities.” The rural Aymara communities,
through popular assemblies, elect communal authorities who administer
punishment. Whenever possible, the aim is to reintegrate the person back
into the community.[^14]

# Revolution

In 2003, people across Bolivia rose up against a plan to export gas to
the US for a cheap price. In October 2003, “residents of El Alto
organized through neighborhood councils and other means, operated as a
neighborhood government that supplanted the delegitimated and absent
state. Descriptions of the insurgency all indicate that there was no
single organization or leadership, and that actions were carried out
directly by the residents of the neighborhoods, overriding all other
institutions and organizations, even the ones created by them
beforehand." In 2006, Evo Morales took power thanks to the strength of
social movements. Morales's administration has since partially
nationalized the country's gas reserves and granted new rights to
indigenous people.[^15]

The Bolivian state has tried to regulate and restrict the El Alto
rebellion. Notably, the Law of Popular Participation shifted some
control from popular assemblies into more restricted and less
participatory councils.[^16]
