# Social Anarchism

**Social anarchism**, also known as **left-wing anarchism** or
**socialist anarchism**, is an
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
tradition that sees
"<a   href="liberty.md" class="wikilink" title="individual liberty">"individual
liberty</a> and
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="social solidarity">"social
solidarity</a> as mutually compatible and desirable.

It advocates for a "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a> to eliminate
hierarchical power structures, such as
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
and the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a>. In
their place, social anarchists encourage
"<a   href="social_collaboration.md" class="wikilink"
title="social collaboration">"social collaboration</a> through
"<a   href="Mutual_aid_(organization_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a> and envision non-hierarchical forms of
"<a   href="social_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="social organization">"social organization</a>, such as
"<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">"voluntary associations</a>.

Identified with the socialist tradition of
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a>, social anarchism is often contrasted with
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">"individualist anarchism</a>.

## Political Principles

### Anti-Capitalism

Social anarchism is opposed to all forms of hierarchical
"<a   href="Power_(social_and_political).md" class="wikilink"
title="power structures">"power structures</a> and
"<a   href="oppression.md" class="wikilink" title="oppression">"oppression</a>,
including (but not limited to) the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> and
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>.[^1]
Social anarchism sees
"<a   href="liberty.md" class="wikilink" title="liberty">"liberty</a> as
interconnected with
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="social solidarity">"social
solidarity</a>,[^2] and considers the maximization of one to be
necessary for the maximization of the other.[^3] As such, social
anarchism seeks to guarantee equal rights to freedom and material
security for all persons.[^4]

Social anarchism envisions the overthrow of capitalism and the state in
a "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a>,[^5] which would
establish a
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federal society">"federal
society</a> of "<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">"voluntary associations</a> and
"<a   href="Local_community.md" class="wikilink"
title="local communities">"local communities</a>,[^6] based on a network
of "<a   href="mutual_aid_(organization_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>.[^7]

The key principles that form the core of social anarchism include
"<a   href="anti-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">"anti-capitalism</a>,
"<a   href="anti-statism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-statism">"anti-statism</a> and
"<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a>.[^8]

As an "<a   href="anti-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalist">"anti-capitalist</a> ideology, social anarchism
is opposed to the dominant expressions of capitalism, including the
expansion of "<a   href="transnational_corporation.md" class="wikilink"
title="transnational corporation">"transnational corporations</a> through
"<a   href="globalization.md" class="wikilink"
title="globalization">"globalization</a>.[^9] It comprises one of the
main forms of
"<a   href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialism">"socialism</a>,
alongside "<a   href="utopian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian socialism">"utopian socialism</a>,
"<a   href="democratic_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic socialism">"democratic socialism</a> and
"<a   href="authoritarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian socialism">"authoritarian socialism</a>.[^10] Social
anarchism rejects private property, particularly private ownership of
the "<a   href="means_of_production.md" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">"means of production</a>, as the principal
source of "<a   href="social_inequality.md" class="wikilink"
title="social inequality">"social inequality</a>.[^11] As such, social
anarchists typically oppose "<a   href="propertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="propertarianism">"propertarianism</a>, as they consider it to
exacerbate social and "<a   href="economic_inequality.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic inequality">"economic inequality</a>, suppress
"<a   href="Agency_(philosophy).md" class="wikilink"
title="individual agency">"individual agency</a> and require the
maintenance of hierarchical institutions.[^12]

Social anarchists argue that the abolition of private property would
lead to the development of new social
"<a   href="mores.md" class="wikilink" title="mores">"mores</a>, encouraging
mutual "<a   href="respect.md" class="wikilink" title="respect">"respect</a>
for individual freedom and the satisfaction of individual needs.[^13]
Social anarchism therefore advocates the
"<a   href="Monopoly#Breaking_up_monopolies.md" class="wikilink"
title="breaking up of monopolies">"breaking up of monopolies</a> and the
institution of "<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">"common ownership</a> over the means of
production.[^14] Instead of capitalist markets, with their profit
motives and wage systems, social anarchism desires to organise
production through a
"<a   href="collective.md" class="wikilink" title="collective">"collective</a>
system of "<a   href="worker_cooperative.md" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperative">"worker cooperatives</a>,
"<a   href="agricultural_commune.md" class="wikilink"
title="agricultural commune">"agricultural communes</a> and
"<a   href="Syndicate#Labor_syndicates.md" class="wikilink"
title="labour syndicates">"labour syndicates</a>.[^15]

While social anarchism has rejected the statism of
"<a   href="Orthodox_Marxism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Orthodox Marxism">"Orthodox Marxism</a>, it has also drawn from
Marxist critiques of capitalism, particularly
"<a   href="Marx&#39;s_theory_of_alienation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marx&#39;s theory of alienation">"Marx's theory of alienation</a>.[^16]
Social anarchists have also been reluctant to adopt the Marxist centring
of the "<a   href="proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="proletariat">"proletariat</a> as revolutionary agents, instead
identifying the revolutionary potential of the
"<a   href="Social_exclusion.md" class="wikilink"
title="socially excluded">"socially excluded</a> segments of
society.[^17]

### Anti-Statism

As an "<a   href="anti-statism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-statist ideology">"anti-statist ideology</a>, social
anarchism opposes the concentration of power in the form of a
state.[^18] To social anarchists, the state is a type of coercive
hierarchy designed to enforce private property and to limit individual
self-development.[^19] Social anarchists reject both
"<a   href="centralised_government.md" class="wikilink"
title="centralised">"centralised</a> and
"<a   href="limited_government.md" class="wikilink"
title="limited forms of government">"limited forms of government</a>,
instead upholding "<a   href="social_collaboration.md" class="wikilink"
title="social collaboration">"social collaboration</a> as a means to
achieve a "<a   href="spontaneous_order.md" class="wikilink"
title="spontaneous order">"spontaneous order</a>, without any
"<a   href="social_contract.md" class="wikilink"
title="social contract">"social contract</a> supplanting
"<a   href="social_relations.md" class="wikilink"
title="social relations">"social relations</a>.[^20] Social anarchists
believe that the abolition of the state will lead to greater
""<a   href="freedom.md" class="wikilink" title="freedom">"freedom</a>,
"<a   href="flourishing.md" class="wikilink"
title="flourishing">"flourishing</a> and
"<a   href="Social_justice.md" class="wikilink" title="fairness">"fairness</a>".[^21]

In the place of a state structure, social anarchists desire
"<a   href="anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchy">"anarchy</a>, which
can be defined as a society without government.[^22] Social anarchists
oppose the use of a state structure to achieve their goals of a
"<a   href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless">"stateless</a> and
"<a   href="classless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="classless society">"classless society</a>,[^23] as they consider
statism to be an inherently
"<a   href="Political_corruption.md" class="wikilink"
title="corrupting influence">"corrupting influence</a>.[^24] They thus
have criticised the Marxist conception of the
""<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a>", which they consider to be
"<a   href="elitism.md" class="wikilink" title="elitist">"elitist</a>,[^25] and
have rejected the possibility of a
""<a   href="withering_away_of_the_state.md" class="wikilink"
title="withering away of the state">"withering away of the state</a>".[^26]

However, some social anarchists such as
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">"Noam
Chomsky</a> sometimes hold state hierarchy to be preferable to economic
hierarchy, and thus lend their support to
"<a   href="welfare_state.md" class="wikilink" title="welfare state">"welfare
state</a> programs like "<a   href="universal_health_care.md" class="wikilink"
title="universal health care">"universal health care</a> that can improve
people's material conditions.[^27]

### Prefigurative Politics

Alongside its opposition to political and economic hierarchies, social
anarchism upholds "<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a>, considering
it necessary for the means to achieve anarchy be consistent with that
end goal.[^28] Social anarchism prefigures itself through
"<a   href="Public_participation_(decision_making).md" class="wikilink"
title="participatory">"participatory</a> and
"<a   href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">"consensus decision-making</a>, which
are capable of generating the diversification of
"<a   href="Diversity_(politics).md" class="wikilink"
title="political values">"political values</a>,
"<a   href="diversity_of_tactics.md" class="wikilink"
title="tactics">"tactics</a> and
"<a   href="Identity_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="identities">"identities</a>.[^29]

Social anarchism therefore promotes
"<a   href="self-organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-organization">"self-organization</a> and the cultivation of a
"<a   href="participatory_culture.md" class="wikilink"
title="participatory culture">"participatory culture</a>, encouraging
individuals to ""<a   href="Do_it_yourself.md" class="wikilink"
title="do things for themselves">"do things for themselves</a>".[^30]
Social anarchism upholds
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a> as a means for people to themselves resist oppression,[^31]
without subordinating their own agency to
"<a   href="representative_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic representatives">"democratic representatives</a> or
"<a   href="vanguardism.md" class="wikilink"
title="revolutionary vanguards">"revolutionary vanguards</a>.[^32] Social
anarchists thus reject the "<a   href="political_party.md" class="wikilink"
title="political party">"political party</a> model of organization,[^33]
instead preferring forms of "<a   href="flat_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="flat organization">"flat organization</a> without any fixed
leadership.[^34]

## Schools of Thought

Characterised by its loose definition and ideological diversity,[^35]
social anarchism has lent itself to
"<a   href="syncretism.md" class="wikilink" title="syncretism">"syncretism</a>,
both drawing from and influencing other ideological critiques of
oppression,[^36] and giving way to a number of different
"<a   href="anarchist_schools_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist schools of thought">"anarchist schools of thought</a>.[^37]

While early forms of anarchism were largely individualistic, the
influence of
"<a   href="Young_Hegelians.md" class="wikilink" title="Left Hegelianism">"Left
Hegelianism</a> infused anarchism with socialistic tendencies, leading
to the constitution of social anarchism.[^38] Over time, the question of
the economic makeup of a future anarchist society drove the development
of social anarchist thought.[^39]

The first school of social anarchism was formulated by
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, whose theory
of "<a   href="mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">"mutualism</a> retained a form of private
property,[^40] advocating for enterprises to be
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed">"self-managed</a> by
"<a   href="worker_cooperative.md" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperative">"worker cooperatives</a>, which would
compensate its workers in
"<a   href="labour_voucher.md" class="wikilink" title="labour voucher">"labour
vouchers</a> issued by ""<a   href="Cooperative_banking.md" class="wikilink"
title="people&#39;s banks">"people's banks</a>".[^41]

This was later supplanted by "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>'s
"<a   href="collectivist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist anarchism">"collectivist anarchism</a>, which
advocated for the "<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">"collective ownership</a> of all property,
but retained a form of
"<a   href="To_each_according_to_his_contribution.md" class="wikilink"
title="individual compensation">"individual compensation</a>.[^42]
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> is considered a founding
figure of collectivist anarchism and was instrumental in developing the
social anarchist tradition.

This finally led to the development of
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">"anarcho-communism</a> by
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a>, who considered that resources should be freely
distributed ""<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs">"from
each according to their ability, to each according to their needs</a>",
without money or wages.[^43]
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> is regarded as the founding figure of communist anarchism
and made significant contributions to anarchist theory.

Social anarchists also adopted the strategy of
"<a   href="syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalism">"syndicalism</a>, which saw
"<a   href="trade_unions.md" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">"trade
unions</a> as the basis for a new
"<a   href="Socialist_economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="socialist economy">"socialist economy</a>,[^44] with
"<a   href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">"anarcho-syndicalism</a> growing to its
greatest influence during the
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">"Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>.[^45]

The main division within social anarchism is over the means for
achieving anarchy, with
"<a   href="philosophical_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="philosophical anarchists">"philosophical anarchists</a> advocating
for peaceful persuasion,[^46] while
"<a   href="insurrectionary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionary anarchists">"insurrectionary anarchists</a>
advocated for ""<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">"propaganda of the deed</a>".[^47] The
former have upheld an "<a   href="anarchism_and_education.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist form of education">"anarchist form of education</a>,
free from
"<a   href="coercion.md" class="wikilink" title="coercion">"coercion</a> and
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">"dogmatism</a>, in order
to establish a self-governing society.[^48] The latter have participated
in rebellions in which they
"<a   href="expropriative_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="expropriated">"expropriated</a> and
"<a   href="collectivization.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivised">"collectivised</a> property, and replaced the state
with a network of autonomous and federally-linked communes.[^49] The aim
was to build a socialist society, without using the state, from the
bottom-up.[^50]

Principles of social anarchism, such as decentralisation,
anti-authoritarianism and mutual aid, later held a key influence on the
"<a   href="new_social_movements.md" class="wikilink"
title="new social movements">"new social movements</a> of the late-20th
century.[^51] It was particularly influential within the
"<a   href="New_Left.md" class="wikilink" title="New Left">"New Left</a> and
"<a   href="green_politics.md" class="wikilink" title="green politics">"green
politics</a>,[^52] with the
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchist">"green
anarchist</a> tendency of
"<a   href="social_ecology_(Bookchin).md" class="wikilink"
title="social ecology">"social ecology</a> drawing directly from social
anarchism.[^53] Social anarchist strategies of direct action and
spontaneity also formed the foundation of the
"<a   href="black_bloc.md" class="wikilink" title="black bloc">"black bloc</a>
tactic, which has become a staple of
"<a   href="contemporary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="contemporary anarchism">"contemporary anarchism</a>.[^54] The
social anarchist principle of prefiguration has also been shared by
sections of anti-state Marxism, particularly that of
"<a   href="autonomism.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomism">"autonomism</a>.[^55]

In the contemporary era, anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism are
the dominant tendencies of social anarchism.[^56]

## Distinction from Individualism

Social anarchism is commonly distinguished from
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">"individualist anarchism</a>,[^57] the
latter of which favours "<a   href="Self-ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="individual sovereignty">"individual sovereignty</a> and
"<a   href="Private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="property">"property</a>,[^58] and can even oppose all forms of
"<a   href="social_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="social organization">"social organization</a> altogether.[^59]
While individualists worry that social anarchism could lead to
"<a   href="tyranny_of_the_majority.md" class="wikilink"
title="tyranny of the majority">"tyranny of the majority</a> and forced
"<a   href="collaboration.md" class="wikilink"
title="collaboration">"collaboration</a>, social anarchists criticise
individualism for encouraging "<a   href="competition.md" class="wikilink"
title="competition">"competition</a> and
"<a   href="Social_alienation.md" class="wikilink"
title="atomizing">"atomizing</a> individuals from each other.[^60]
Individualism was heavily criticised by classical social
anarchists,[^61] such as Bakunin and Kropotkin, who held that the
liberty of a few individuals was potentially harmful to the equality of
all mankind.[^62]

However, this distinction is also contested,[^63] as anarchism itself is
often seen as a synthesis of
"<a   href="Individualism#Liberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="liberal individualism">"liberal individualism</a> and
"<a   href="Egalitarianism#Social_egalitarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="social egalitarianism">"social egalitarianism</a>.[^64] Some
social anarchists, such as
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a> and
"<a   href="Herbert_Read.md" class="wikilink" title="Herbert Read">"Herbert
Read</a>, were even directly inspired by the individualist philosophy of
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">"Max
Stirner</a>.[^65] Social anarchism generally attempts to reconcile
individual freedoms with the freedom of others, in order to maximise the
freedom of everyone and allow for individuality to flourish.[^66]
Individualists and social anarchists have even been able to cooperate by
upholding "communal individuality", emphasising both individual freedom
and community strength.[^67] Some social anarchists have argued that the
divisions between them and the individualists can be overcome, by
emphasising their shared commitment to anti-capitalism and
anti-authoritarianism.[^68] But others draw the line at forms of
individualism that uphold hierarchical power relations.[^69]

In his 1995 book, *Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism*,
"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">"Murray Bookchin</a> defined social anarchism in
contrast to what he called "lifestyle anarchism".[^70] According to
Bookchin, it was impossible for the two tendencies to coexist, claiming
there to be an "unbridgeable chasm" that separated them from each
other.[^71] Bookchin held social anarchism to be the only genuine form
of anarchism, considering individualism to be inherently
oppressive.[^72] But his separation of the two tendencies has been
criticised and even rejected entirely by other anarchists.[^73] His
analysis has been criticised as "reductive" and "undialectical", due to
his failure to recognise the many connections and interrelations between
the two tendencies.[^74]

Although sometimes considered a form of individualist anarchism,[^75]
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">"anarcho-capitalism</a> is typically rejected
as a legitimate "<a   href="anarchist_school_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist school of thought">"anarchist school of thought</a> by
social anarchists, who uphold "<a   href="anti-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">"anti-capitalism</a> as a central principle.[^76]
The two have engaged in a contested debate over the term
""<a   href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian">"libertarian</a>", which was initially a synonym for
the ""<a   href="Left-libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="left-libertarian">"left-libertarian</a>" social anarchism but was
later also claimed by ""<a   href="Right-libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-libertarian">"right-libertarian</a>" anarcho-capitalists,
with each rejecting the "libertarian" credentials of the other.[^77] In
contrast, social anarchists accept
"<a   href="Individualist_anarchism_in_the_United_States.md" class="wikilink"
title="American individualist anarchists">"American individualist
anarchists</a> like "<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a> and
"<a   href="Lysander_Spooner.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lysander Spooner">"Lysander Spooner</a> as genuine, due in part to
their opposition to capitalism.[^78] In turn, modern anti-capitalist
individualists like
"<a   href="Kevin_Carson.md" class="wikilink" title="Kevin Carson">"Kevin
Carson</a> have drawn inspiration from social anarchism, while retaining
their "<a   href="market_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="pro-market views">"pro-market views</a>.[^79] Libertarian scholar
Roderick T. Long has thus suggested that left-wing market anarchists
could use their position to
"<a   href="Mediation.md" class="wikilink" title="mediate">"mediate</a> between
social anarchists and anarcho-capitalists, arguing for an
"<a   href="Ecumenism.md" class="wikilink" title="ecumenical view">"ecumenical
view</a> of anarchism and libertarianism.[^80]

## Equality

Social anarchism values "<a   href="social_equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="social equality">"social equality</a>, in that it is opposed to
the inequalities produced by hierarchies. It is not opposed to all
inequality, instead seeing inequalities based on need, that require
fundamentally different treatment, to be acceptable and sometimes
desirable. Social anarchism sees inequalities of rank or hierarchy, or
gross material inequalities, as damaging to society and
individuals.[^81] Social anarchists believe that a society organised
non-hierarchically would eliminate much of the inequality that presently
exists.[^82] The goal of social anarchism cannot be understood to be
equality alone.[^83]
