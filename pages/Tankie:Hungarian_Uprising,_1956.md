### Notes

- The Open Society Archives are a good place to find primary source
  documents, just put in the right search terms.
- Among their main arguments is that Soviet forces intervened to protect
  Jews and Communists from being lynched en masse. What many of these
  sources (in English and Hungarian) prove is that while antisemitism
  did exist, it was marginal and that Jews generally supported the
  Revolution. In any chaotic mass-movement, bad elements might come to
  the surface, but generally the Revolutionaries suppressed such things
  within their own ranks whenever possible.
- Also, the Kádár regime itself admitted that of the 201 officials
  killed by the Revolutionaries, only nine were not affiliated with the
  secret police. Policemen are the legitimate targets of revolutionary
  violence in these sorts of circumstances.
- One of their main claims is of the Revolution’s “fascist” character:
  again, all wrong. Main ringleaders like Pál Maletér, Sándor Kopácsi,
  József Dudas had taken part in the anti-fascist resistance in World
  War II. Imre Nagy and the people surrounding him were reform
  Communists, and they were joined by democratic politicians of the
  postwar period such as Béla Kovács and Zoltán Tildy. And most of the
  street fighters were simple ordinary people, with no “fascist”
  records, who in many cases pledged their allegiance to “socialism” of
  some sort. The closest thing to such a person is General Béla Király,
  who served in the Hungarian Army during WWII. But he is confirmed as
  having used his influence to save Jews and is even a Righteous Among
  Nations, and the Communist Party employed him in 1945-51.
- Another main accusation is that the Revolution was started from
  outside the country, aided and abetted by the CIA/Western intelligence
  with exiles flown in from Austria to fight. However, the CIA had one
  agent in the entire country, as per declassified documents. The
  Austrian authorities also stringently prevented exiles from entering
  the country and patrolled the border against armed incursions.
- “Hungarian nationalists and fascists celebrate it today” – they also
  celebrate the 1848 Revolution, Prince Rákóczi’s Revolt of 1703, the
  Siege of Eger, Grand Prince Árpád, etc. It would be hard to find any
  self-proclaimed “Hungarian patriot,” fascist or otherwise, who doesn’t
  celebrate 1956 or any of the other things. That doesn’t besmirch any
  of those events/people.

- Outside of Soviet propaganda, their main source is *The Truth About
  Hungary* by Herbert Aptheker. Shane Mage’s pamphlet debunks this
  book’s methodology in one of its sections. \[I will post further
  material debunking certain specific arguments from this book\]
