# Marxist-Leninist States

## Overview

This page provides a comprehensive directory of Marxist-Leninist states
throughout history, organized by their current status.
"<a   href="Marxist_Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninism">"Marxist-Leninism</a>, as a political ideology
and system of governance, has been implemented in numerous countries
since the establishment of the
"<a   href="Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics.md" class="wikilink"
title="Union of Soviet Socialist Republics">"Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics</a> in 1922. This directory categorizes these states into
existing states, defunct states that collapsed or were dissolved, failed
revolutionary attempts, and states that transitioned away from
Marxist-Leninism through reform or internal political change.

other political systems through internal reform, liberalization, or

Leninist states. That is a failure rate of 87.5%. Excluding North Korea
that is a 90% failure rate (or a 10% success rate).

## Marxist-Leninist and Socialist Parties That Abandoned Revolutionary Politics

These political parties were founded as revolutionary Marxist,
Marxist-Leninist, or Trotskyist organizations but underwent major
ideological transformations, abandoning their revolutionary politics for
social democracy, right-wing politics, or market-oriented reformism.
Unlike the states listed above, these parties transformed through
internal political evolution rather than external defeat or collapse.

  Bengal: 34 years, 1977-2011)

### Pattern Analysis

The ideological transformation of Marxist and socialist parties follows
several patterns:

1.  **Eurocommunism to Social Democracy**: Most major Western European
    communist parties (Italy, France, Spain) adopted Eurocommunism in
    the 1970s, distancing from Soviet Union, then further moderated into
    social democracy or dissolved entirely in the 1990s
2.  **Post-1989 Adaptation**: Eastern European communist parties rapidly
    transformed into social-democratic parties following the fall of the
    Berlin Wall, retaining organizational continuity but abandoning
    Marxism-Leninism
3.  **Gradual Market Liberalization**: Traditional social democratic
    parties (Germany, Sweden, UK) progressively abandoned socialist
    economic goals for market-oriented policies, particularly during the
    neoliberal era of the 1980s-1990s
4.  **Revolutionary to Electoral**: Some communist parties (CPI-M
    Kerala, JSP) abandoned revolutionary politics for parliamentary
    participation while initially maintaining socialist commitments

These transformations represent the political counterpart to the
state-level transitions and collapses documented above, demonstrating
that Marxist-Leninist and revolutionary socialist politics faced crisis
not only where they achieved state power, but also within democratic
political systems where they operated as opposition parties.
