The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 or Hungarian Uprising of 1956
(Hungarian: 1956-os forradalom or felkelés) was a spontaneous nationwide
revolt against the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and its
Soviet-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956.
It was the first major threat to Soviet control since the USSR's forces
drove out the Nazis at the end of World War II and occupied Eastern
Europe. Despite the failure of the uprising, it was highly influential,
and came to play a role in the downfall of the Soviet Union decades
later.

The revolt began as a student demonstration, which attracted thousands
as they marched through central Budapest to the Parliament building,
calling out on the streets using a van with loudspeakers via Radio Free
Europe. A student delegation entering the radio building to try to
broadcast the students' demands, was detained. When the delegation's
release was demanded by the demonstrators outside, they were fired upon
by the State Security Police (ÁVH) from within the building. When the
students were fired on, a student died and was wrapped in a flag and
held above the crowd. This was the start of the revolution. As the news
spread, disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital.

The revolt spread quickly across Hungary and the government collapsed.
Thousands organised into militias, battling the ÁVH and Soviet troops.
Pro-Soviet communists and ÁVH members were often executed or imprisoned
and former prisoners were released and armed. Radical impromptu workers'
councils wrested municipal control from the ruling Hungarian Working
People's Party and demanded political changes. A new government formally
disbanded the ÁVH, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw
Pact, and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October,
fighting had almost stopped and a sense of normality began to return.

After announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet
forces, the Politburo changed its mind and moved to crush the
revolution. On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and
other regions of the country. The Hungarian resistance continued until
10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in
the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and
denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new
Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These
Soviet actions, while strengthening control over Eastern Europe,
alienated many Western Marxists."[^1]

# Hungarian Revolution of 1956

The **Hungarian Revolution of 1956** was a spontaneous working-class
uprising against the Soviet-backed Stalinist government of Hungary. From
23 October to 10 November 1956, Hungarian workers, students, and
soldiers fought against both the Hungarian secret police (ÁVH) and
Soviet troops, establishing revolutionary workers' councils that took
control of factories and entire cities. The revolution represented a
direct challenge to state capitalism, with workers demanding genuine
socialism based on direct democracy and workers' self-management rather
than party dictatorship.

## Background

Following World War II, Hungary fell under Soviet domination. The
Hungarian Communist Party, led by Mátyás Rákosi, established a brutal
Stalinist regime. Between 1950 and 1953, the ÁVH secret police
imprisoned 26,000 people, with 13,000 interned in concentration camps
and 229 executed. The regime imposed forced collectivization on
peasants, nationalized industry under bureaucratic control, and
subjected workers to production norms and unpaid overtime to "celebrate"
party anniversaries.

Living standards collapsed as the government prioritized heavy industry
over consumer needs. By 1955, workers' disposable income had fallen to
two-thirds of 1938 levels. Theft from state enterprises became
widespread as workers struggled to survive. The regime responded with
further repression rather than reform. As one Hungarian worker later
recalled: "Under Communism, we should have a share in governing Hungary,
but instead we're the poorest people in the country. We're just regarded
as factory fodder."[^2]

The regime maintained control through the ÁVH, whose minimum pay
exceeded workers' wages by three times. The ÁVH had their own subsidized
stores and holiday villages while ordinary Hungarians queued for
rationed bread and sugar. Workers developed a saying: "We are a
three-class society — those who have been there \[in prison\], those who
are there, and those who are heading there."[^3]

## The Uprising

On 22 October 1956, students at Budapest Technical University drafted
sixteen demands including removal of Soviet troops, free elections,
workers' control of factories, and the right to strike. The next day,
students marched to the statue of Polish General Józef Bem, a hero of
the 1848 revolution. Workers leaving factories joined the demonstration,
which swelled to 200,000 people by evening.

When demonstrators gathered at the Radio building to broadcast their
demands, the ÁVH opened fire, killing several students. This massacre
sparked the revolution. Workers raided arsenals and arms factories,
distributing weapons. Hungarian soldiers, refusing to fire on the
crowds, handed over their weapons and joined the uprising. By morning,
workers from the industrial districts of Csepel and Újpest arrived with
lorries full of ammunition.

The fighting was led primarily by young workers. Hospital casualty lists
showed that 80-90% of the wounded were workers, with half under thirty
years old. A doctor noted: "There were any number of youngsters amongst
the fighters who knew nothing about the Petőfi Circle or who hadn't even
heard of it, and who replied to the question as to why they had risked
their lives in the fighting with such answers as, 'Well, is it really
worth living for 600 forints a month?'"[^4]

The revolution had no central leadership. As one fighter explained:
"There was no organisation whatsoever, consequently there was no
discipline either, but there was astonishingly good teamwork." Another
stated: "Some people got together, fought, went home, then others came
and continued the fight."[^5]

## Revolutionary Discipline and Mutual Aid

Despite the violence of the uprising, a remarkable moral discipline
characterized the revolution. Economist Peter Wiles, who visited Hungary
during the revolution, noted what he called an "astonishing moral
purity":

> Poland had less chance to show this than Hungary, where for weeks
> there was no authority. In a frenzy of anarchist self-discipline the
> people, including the criminals, stole nothing, beat no Jews, and
> never got drunk. They went so far as to lynch only security policemen
> (AVH) leaving other Communists untouched... The moral achievement is
> perhaps unparalleled in revolutionary history... Their sole initiative
> was the astonishing and deeply moving despatch of free food to
> Budapest after the first Soviet attack had been beaten.[^6]

A Hungarian eyewitness described the spontaneous solidarity that emerged
in the streets:

> May I tell you one thing about this common sense of the street, during
> these first days of the revolution? Just, for example, many hours
> standing in queues for bread and even under such circumstances not a
> single fight. One day we were standing in a queue and then a truck
> came with two young boys with machine guns and they were asking us to
> give them any money we could spare to buy bread for the fighters. All
> the queue was collecting half a truck-full of bread... Another
> example: naturally all the shop windows broke in the first day, but
> not a single thing inside was touched by anybody. You could have seen
> broken-in shop windows and candy stores, and even the little children
> didn't touch anything in it. Not even camera shops, opticians or
> jewellers. Not a single thing was touched for two or three days... And
> in these first days it was a custom to put big boxes on street corners
> or on crossings where more streets met, and just a script over them
> 'This is for the wounded, for the casualties or for the families of
> the dead,' and they were set out in the morning and by noon they were
> full of money.[^7]

Signs appeared on shops with broken windows: "This is how we loot" —
pointing to undisturbed merchandise. The revolution maintained strict
discipline without police, with disputes settled by revolutionary courts
rather than mob violence. Peasants organized food convoys to feed the
cities, and bakers worked throughout to ensure fighters and strikers had
bread.

## Workers' Councils

Within days, revolutionary workers' councils formed throughout Hungary.
The first Budapest council appeared at the United Lamp factory on 24
October, representing 10,000 workers. By 26 October, councils existed in
Miskolc, Győr, Debrecen, and other industrial centers. These councils
assumed both economic and political power, dismissing communist
managers, establishing factory militias, and coordinating resistance to
Soviet forces.

On 31 October, delegates from Budapest's councils met to establish the
Parliament of Workers' Councils. Their nine-point program declared that
factories belonged to the workers, who would elect their own management
and control all major decisions regarding production, wages, and
profits. The councils represented genuine workers' democracy, with
delegates subject to immediate recall if they diverged from their
mandate.

The Borsod Workers' Council declared it "resolutely condemns the
organisation of political parties,"[^8] reflecting the councils'
rejection of both communist party rule and capitalist parliamentary
systems. In 1,170 communities, revolutionary councils dismissed local
administrators, sacked communist bosses, and burned party records.
Workers destroyed symbols of Soviet domination — red stars, Stalin
statues, and communist literature.

## Soviet Invasion and Defeat

The Soviet Union initially withdrew troops from Budapest on 28 October,
creating an illusion of victory. Prime Minister Imre Nagy announced
Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and declared neutrality.
However, this prompted Moscow to order a massive second intervention.

On 4 November, 17 Soviet divisions with over 2,000 tanks attacked
Budapest and other Hungarian cities. The workers' councils immediately
declared a general strike. Heaviest resistance came from working-class
districts, particularly Csepel, where workers held out until 11 November
despite overwhelming Soviet firepower.

Between 2,500 and 3,000 Hungarians died, along with 700 Soviet troops.
The Hungarian army largely refused to fight for the Soviets, with
soldiers either joining the revolution or remaining neutral. Soviet
troops encountered resistance in every major industrial area, requiring
artillery and air strikes to overcome worker positions.

## The Counter-Revolution

János Kádár established a puppet government with Soviet backing,
immediately targeting the workers' councils. On 8 December, the Kádár
government arrested the Central Workers' Council leadership and declared
striking punishable by death. Soviet troops occupied major factories,
forcing workers to labor at gunpoint.

The councils refused to surrender voluntarily. When threatened with
arrest, councils resigned en masse rather than legitimize the regime,
declaring "sabotage and passive resistance are the order of the day."
Workers' councils led continued resistance through strikes and slowdowns
until mid-1957, disrupting the economy and demonstrating that real power
still rested with the working class.

The repression was severe: 26,000 arrested, 22,000 sentenced and
imprisoned, 13,000 interned, and 229 executed. Imre Nagy, along with
Defense Minister Pál Maléter and journalist Miklós Gimes, was executed
in 1958 after a secret trial. Approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled to
Austria. The last internment camps closed only in June 1960.

## Western "Support" and the Counter-Revolutionary Lie

The Soviet Union and Kádár government claimed the revolution was a
fascist counter-revolution organized by Western imperialists. This
narrative served to justify the brutal repression and became standard
propaganda throughout the Eastern Bloc.

The evidence contradicts this claim entirely. The revolution began
spontaneously with student demonstrations that attracted workers leaving
their shifts. No Western organization planned or coordinated the
uprising. The participants were overwhelmingly workers and students, not
dispossessed capitalists or aristocrats. Hospital records confirm that
casualties were primarily young workers from industrial districts.

The revolutionaries' demands were explicitly anti-capitalist. Workers'
council programs called for social ownership of factories under worker
control, not capitalist restoration. Béla Kovacs of the Smallholders
Party stated: "No one, I believe, wants to re-establish the world of the
aristocrats, the bankers and the capitalists. That world is definitely
gone."[^9] Even the Catholic Party leader declared support for
maintaining "the social victories which have been realised since 1945."

Western governments provided no material support during the revolution.
Despite earlier rhetoric about "rolling back" communism in Eastern
Europe, the United States explicitly told the Soviet Union during the
uprising: "We do not see these states as potential military
allies."[^10] The concurrent Suez Crisis prevented any Western
intervention even had it been contemplated.

The supposed "support" came only in the form of Radio Free Europe
broadcasts and later refugee assistance. While RFE broadcasts may have
raised false hopes, they provided no weapons, supplies, or military
intervention. As Hungarian politician Géza Jeszenszky noted, the same UN
that intervened in Korea took no action in Hungary.

The accusation of fascism was particularly dishonest. The
revolutionaries explicitly rejected nationalism and anti-Semitism. When
right-wing papers attempted to publish, printers refused to touch them.
The revolution maintained its socialist and internationalist character
throughout, with foreign students and workers joining the fighting
alongside Hungarians.

The real "counter-revolution" was the Soviet invasion itself, which
restored capitalist social relations under state control and crushed
workers' power. As one participant observed: "The Hungarian workers were
fighting for the principle of direct democracy" and declared "all power
should be transferred to the Workers Committees of Hungary."[^11]

## Legacy

The Hungarian Revolution demonstrated that workers could organize
society, run production, and maintain order without capitalist owners or
communist bureaucrats. The councils proved that direct democracy and
workers' self-management represented a genuine alternative to both
Western capitalism and Soviet state capitalism.

The revolution influenced communist parties worldwide. In Italy and
France, thousands resigned from communist parties in protest. In
Britain, the Communist Party lost members when leadership supported the
Soviet invasion. Even within the USSR, the repression sparked dissent
among intellectuals and reformers.

For anarchists and libertarian socialists, Hungary 1956 vindicated the
critique of authoritarian communism and demonstrated the revolutionary
potential of workers' councils. The revolution showed that the working
class remained the agent of social transformation, even under supposedly
"socialist" regimes. The councils' combination of economic control and
political power through direct democracy offered a model for genuine
socialism from below.

The Hungarian workers raised the banners of democracy and national
independence that Stalin had said the progressive bourgeoisie had
abandoned. They fought not for capitalism or fascism, but for genuine
socialism based on workers' power. Though militarily defeated, their
example inspired liberation movements and working-class struggles for
decades afterward.
