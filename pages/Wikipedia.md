**Wikipedia** is an "<a   href="Open_Source_Software.md" class="wikilink"
title="open-source">"open-source</a> project on the internet designed to
make knowledge
"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="accessible to all">"accessible
to all</a>. It was founded in
"<a   href="Timeline_of_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="2001">"2001</a>
and has since grown to have versions in nearly 300 languages with
48,000,000 articles between them all.[^1] According to
"<a   href="Peter_Gelderloos.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">"Peter Gelderloos</a> (writing in 2010):

> Open Source and participatory technology are steadily becoming
> accessible to an extent unprecedented by proprietary software.
> Wikipedia exemplifies this. Started recently, in 2001, on Open Source
> "<a   href="Linux.md" class="wikilink" title="Linux">"Linux</a> software,
> Wikipedia is already the largest and most accessed encyclopedia in the
> world, with over 10 million articles in more than 250 languages.
> Rather than being the exclusive domain of paid experts from a
> particular academic subculture, Wikipedia is written by everyone.
> Anyone can author an article or edit an existing article, and by
> allowing this openness and trust it provides a forum for
> instantaneous, multiple-peer review. The interests of the broader
> Wikipedia community of millions provide a self-regulating function, so
> vandalism — false editing and bogus articles — are quickly cleaned up,
> and facts lacking citations are challenged. Wikipedia articles avail
> themselves of a vastly greater body of knowledge than the small and
> generally elitist circle represented by academia. In a blind,
> peer-reviewed study it was judged to be as accurate as
> <em>Encyclopedia Britannica.</em>

> Wikipedia is “self-organizing” and edited by an open body of
> peer-elected administrators. There have been a few publicized cases of
> intentional sabotage, such as when the televised news comedy show
> <em>The Colbert Report</em> rewrote history in one Wikipedia article
> as a gag for their show; but the prank was quickly fixed, as most
> false information on the site tends to be. A more lingering problem is
> posed by corporations who use Wikipedia for public relations purposes,
> tasking paid personnel to maintain a clean image in the articles about
> them. However, contradicting interpretations of the facts can be
> registered in the same article, and Wikipedia contains much more
> information on corporate misdeeds than any traditional
> encyclopedia.[^2]
