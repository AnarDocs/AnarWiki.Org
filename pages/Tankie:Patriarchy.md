### Notes

- Abortion was banned in the USSR as a natalist measure (to increase the
  birth rate) in 1933. Criminalization of homosexuality in the same year
  was motivated by the same logic
- In “Socialist” Romania, natalist anti-abortion policies from 1966-1989
  led to overcrowding of orphanages (2 million unwanted children) and
  severe violations of women’s and children’s rights (10,000 women died
  as a result of anti-abortion decree)
- While people with uteruses were equal to people without uteruses in
  the workplace, they still had to perform free gendered labour of
  raising children at home
