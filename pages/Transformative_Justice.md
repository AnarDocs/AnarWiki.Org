# Transformative Justice

**Transformative justice** is a spectrum of social, economic, legal, and
political practices and philosophies that aim to focus on the structures
and underlying conditions that perpetuate harm and injustice.[^1] Unlike
<a href="restorative_justice" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a>, which seeks to
repair harm within existing systems, transformative justice imagines and
puts into practice alternatives to the formal, state-based
<a href="criminal_justice" class="wikilink"
title="criminal justice">criminal justice</a> system while
simultaneously working to dismantle the structural hierarchies that
create conditions for harm.

## Overview

As defined by American activist
<a href="Mariame_Kaba" class="wikilink" title="Mariame Kaba">Mariame
Kaba</a>, transformative justice is a framework that focuses on
community-building and collective solidarity against the repressive
mechanisms of the carceral state.[^2] First popularized by Queer, Black,
Indigenous, Latinx, and other marginalized communities who perceived
they were unable to rely on police and courts to obtain justice after
being victimized by interpersonal harm, it prioritizes the relationships
between the individual, the communities to which they are accountable,
and the broader systems in which we are implicated.[^3]

Contemporary transformative justice theorizing traces its lineage to
anti-carceral and abolitionist social movements led by Black,
Indigenous, and other racialized communities who are often directly
harmed by the carceral state. It aims to resist and divest from
traditional methods of state-sanctioned punishment such as police,
prisons, the judiciary, and juvenile delinquency programs, recognizing
that these institutions frequently inflict compounding harm through
surveillance and social control.

Transformative justice rests on the belief that interpersonal harm
interacts with and reflects systemic and institutional mechanisms of
oppression. Sexual assault, for instance, mirrors patriarchal
conceptions of women as devoid of personal agency. Therefore, addressing
individual interpersonal harm must simultaneously aim to dismantle
systemic structures of power such as
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>,
cisheteronormativity,
<a href="racism" class="wikilink" title="racism">racism</a>, ableism,
and <a href="colonialism" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">colonialism</a>.

## Anarchist Perspective

<a href="Anarchist_criminology" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist criminology">Anarchist criminology</a> tends to favour
holistic transformative justice approaches over restorative justice,
arguing that the latter remains too beholden to existing criminal
justice systems.[^4] From an anarchist viewpoint, transformative justice
represents a fundamental challenge to
<a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> authority and
hierarchical power structures that perpetuate violence and oppression.

Anarchists recognize that institutions like police and prisons are not
"broken" systems in need of reform, but rather structures designed to
reinforce social inequities and protect existing power hierarchies. The
<a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> uses these
institutions to criminalize dissent, arrest and harass human rights
activists, and maintain control over marginalized populations. The
violence unleashed by the state and dominant groups is rarely considered
violence, while those who protest oppressive structures face swift
criminalization.

The anarchist approach to transformative justice emphasizes that true
justice cannot be achieved through state mechanisms but must emerge from
autonomous community responses that address root causes of harm. This
involves dismantling not only the carceral system but also the broader
structures of
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
patriarchy, and other hierarchical systems that create conditions for
violence and exploitation.

## Principles and Practices

Transformative justice applies a systems approach, seeking to understand
problems not only as evidence of harm but as catalysts that reveal
deeper structural issues. It recognizes that addressing harm requires
transformative, relational, and educational interventions for all
parties - those who experienced harm, those who caused harm, and the
broader community.

Writer and practitioner <a href="adrienne_maree_brown" class="wikilink"
title="adrienne maree brown">adrienne maree brown</a> emphasizes that
transformative justice cannot occur if responses to transgression
involve public takedowns reminiscent of
<a href="cancel_culture" class="wikilink" title="cancel culture">cancel
culture</a>. Instead, she advocates for:

- Deliberate listening with the goal of understanding contexts that
  enabled specific harm
- Learning from each conflict to facilitate introspection
- Considering alternatives to public confrontation, such as personal
  exchange to build trust, resilience and interdependence[^5]

Transformative justice focuses on consequences rather than punishment.
Unlike punishment, which deprives people of basic needs for living,
consequences identify positions of power that enabled harm and remove
access to prevent repetition. These consequences should be proportional
to harm caused and focused on transformation rather than retribution.

## Distinction from Restorative Justice

While transformative justice and
<a href="restorative_justice" class="wikilink"
title="restorative justice">restorative justice</a> share some
ideological underpinnings, they differ fundamentally in their
relationship to existing systems and their scope of intervention.
Restorative justice typically operates within or alongside existing
state structures, often maintaining collaborative relationships with law
enforcement and criminal justice systems. Many restorative justice
programs take place within jails or involve state-sponsored justice
systems, leaving them vulnerable to co-optation by carceral logic.

Transformative justice, by contrast, explicitly operates outside state
mechanisms and focuses on addressing harm at its structural roots. Where
restorative justice seeks to return victims to their initial state
before harm occurred, transformative justice questions whether pre-harm
conditions were themselves equitable and just. It recognizes that simply
restoring people to previous situations does nothing to address
underlying systems of oppression that create ongoing vulnerability to
harm.

The key distinction lies in transformative justice's commitment to
systemic change. As <a href="adrienne_maree_brown" class="wikilink"
title="adrienne maree brown">adrienne maree brown</a> illustrates, if
someone steals money to buy food due to systemic inequality, returning
the money with an apology does nothing to address the hunger or economic
system that created the desperation. Transformative justice requires
"the work of addressing harm at the root, outside the mechanisms of the
state, so that we can grow into right relationship with one
another."[^6]

## Applications

### Sexual Violence

Transformative justice aims to recognize and respond to the needs of
survivors of <a href="sexual_violence" class="wikilink"
title="sexual violence">sexual violence</a> while acknowledging the
interconnectedness of individual and social justice. It holds that
experiences of intimate partner violence and sexual violence are linked
to broader hierarchies of power based on race, class, gender, sexuality,
ability, and legal status.

Generation FIVE identifies four principles for transformative justice
responses to sexual violence:

- Survivor safety, healing and agency
- Offender accountability and transformation
- Community response and accountability
- Transformation of community and social conditions that perpetuate
  sexual violence[^7]

### Anti-Carceral Organizing

Transformative justice connects closely with
<a href="prison_abolition" class="wikilink"
title="prison abolition">prison abolition</a> movements, recognizing
that true safety cannot be achieved through systems designed to cause
harm. <a href="Prison_abolition" class="wikilink"
title="Prison abolition">Prison abolition</a> is not simply about
closing jails but represents a framework for eliminating all forms of
coercion including capitalism, patriarchy, and other hierarchical
systems.

Abolitionists work to address root causes of harm through community
investment, ensuring access to housing, healthcare, education, and
living wages. This approach recognizes that most harms stem from
structural conditions rather than individual pathology, requiring
systemic solutions rather than individual punishment.

## Criticism

Some feminist critics note that victim-survivors may desire retributive
solutions, and transformative justice practitioners must remain
attentive to the profound nature of certain harms while maintaining
commitment to non-carceral responses.[^8] Others question the practical
implementation of transformative justice in cases involving severe
repeated harm.

Transformative justice advocates acknowledge these concerns while
maintaining that current punitive systems demonstrably fail to provide
safety or healing. They emphasize that transformative justice is not
about ignoring harm or avoiding accountability, but rather creating more
effective and humane responses that address root causes.
