# Libertarian Youth

The **Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth** (Spanish: *Federación
Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias*, **FIJL**), commonly known as
**Libertarian Youth** (*Juventudes Libertarias*), is an
"<a   href="Anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalist">"anarcho-syndicalist</a> youth organization
founded in 1932 in
"<a   href="Madrid.md" class="wikilink" title="Madrid">"Madrid</a>. The
organization represents the youth wing of the broader Spanish anarchist
movement and has historically maintained close ties with the
"<a   href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">"Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT) and the
"<a   href="Iberian_Anarchist_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Iberian Anarchist Federation">"Iberian Anarchist Federation</a>
(FAI), while maintaining its organizational independence.

## History

### Origins

The FIJL was created in 1932 in Madrid during the period of the
"<a   href="Second_Spanish_Republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="Second Spanish Republic">"Second Spanish Republic</a>.[^1] Unlike
some youth organizations that functioned as subordinate sections of
parent organizations, the FIJL established itself as the third
independent branch of the Spanish libertarian movement, alongside the
CNT and FAI. This organizational independence would prove crucial in
maintaining ideological coherence during later political crises.

The organization's statement of principles declared its aim "to invest
young people with a libertarian conviction, as to equip them
individually to struggle against authority in all its forms, whether in
trade union matters or in ideological ones, so as to attain a
libertarian social arrangement."[^2]

### Spanish Civil War

In February 1937, the FIJL organized a plenum of regional organizations,
representing its second congress. By October 1938, the organization
participated in a national plenum of the libertarian movement in
Barcelona alongside the CNT and FAI, demonstrating its equal standing
within the broader movement.[^3]

During the "<a   href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">"Spanish Civil War</a> and
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">"Spanish Revolution</a>, the FIJL played a
vital role in both military resistance to fascism and revolutionary
transformation. The organization maintained its revolutionary principles
throughout the conflict, even as elements of the CNT-FAI leadership made
controversial decisions to participate in government structures.

During the May Days of 1937, when conflicts erupted between anarchists
and
"<a   href="Stalinism.md" class="wikilink" title="Stalinists">"Stalinists</a>
in Barcelona, many FIJL members were murdered by forces acting under
Stalin's orders.[^4] The organization suffered severe repression but
continued its resistance activities.

The FIJL's most famous member was
"<a   href="Federico_Borrell_García.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federico Borrell García">"Federico Borrell García</a>,
immortalized in
"<a   href="Robert_Capa.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Capa">"Robert
Capa</a>'s photograph *The Falling Soldier*, which captured the moment
of his death during the war in 1936.

### Exile and Clandestinity

Following the Republican defeat in 1939, the FIJL operated on two
fronts: a section in exile based in
"<a   href="Paris.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris">"Paris</a>, and a
clandestine domestic organization under Franco's dictatorship. Some FIJL
members became associated with the militant
"<a   href="First_of_May_Group.md" class="wikilink"
title="First of May Group">"First of May Group</a>, which carried out
direct action operations against the Franco regime.[^5]

The French government banned the FIJL in 1963 as part of broader
repression of Spanish republican exile organizations.[^6]

### 21st Century

During the early 2000s, the FIJL evolved toward
"<a   href="Insurrectionary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionist">"insurrectionist</a> positions, influenced by
black bloc tactics in anti-globalization protests and developments in
the Italian and Greek anarchist movements. This shift created tensions
with the traditional anarcho-syndicalist approach and led to a period of
state repression and organizational inactivity.[^7]

In 2006, a new generation of anarchist youth established a reformed FIJL
that critically defended anarcho-syndicalism while differentiating
itself from the insurrectionist tendency. After discovering the original
insurrectionist FIJL still existed, this group renamed itself the
Iberian Federation of Anarchist Youth (FIJA) in 2007, while claiming to
represent the ideological heritage of the historic FIJL.[^8]

When the insurrectionist FIJL disbanded in March 2012, FIJA reclaimed
the FIJL name. The contemporary organization maintains a presence in
Asturias, Cádiz, San Sebastián, Granada, Lorca, and Madrid.

## Publications

### Ruta

The primary publication of the FIJL was *Ruta* (Road), which began as
*Juventud Libre* (Free Youth) before adopting its more famous name in
October 1936. The paper exemplified the independent character of the
libertarian youth movement.

Initially, the Catalan Libertarian Youth (JJ.LL) had functioned as the
"Cultural and Propaganda Section of the FAI," which created tensions
with other regional youth groups until unity was achieved around the
FIJL structure.[^9]

Throughout the civil war, *Ruta* maintained an uncompromising anarchist
position. As Victor Garcia wrote, "her columns never failed to proclaim
the orthodox position of all anarchists: war on the state, authority,
privilege, religion, right up to militarism." This principled stance
occurred even when the CNT and FAI made "shameful collaborationist
blunders" by accepting government positions.[^10]

The paper's management was held successively by Fidel Miró, José
Peirats, Manuel Pérez, Santana Calero, Benito Milla, and Benjamin Cano
Ruiz. Under Peirats's direction especially, *Ruta* maintained its
revolutionary purity, critiquing the compromises of the adult
organizations while facing "coercion and threats from the two 'sister'
organisations."[^11]

*Ruta* featured prominent anarchist writers including Felipe Alaiz,
Higinio Noja Ruiz, Lucía Sánchez Saornil (founder of
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">"Mujeres
Libres</a>), and many others. The paper continued publication in
Barcelona until 26 January 1939, when fascist forces captured the city.

In exile, *Ruta* was reestablished in Marseilles before moving to
Toulouse, continuing to push "the classic revolutionary and
anti-government line of anarchism" against continuing collaborationist
tendencies in the exile movement. The exiled *Ruta* was eventually
published from Venezuela, where it continued into the 1960s.[^12]

### Other Publications

The FIJL published the newspaper *El Fuelle* in the contemporary period.
Historically, libertarian youth across Spain maintained numerous local
publications as part of the broader anarchist press network.

## Anarchist Youth Movements Internationally

### United States

The 1930s saw significant anarchist youth organizing in the United
States, primarily driven by second-generation immigrants seeking to
break through linguistic barriers erected by their parents' generation.
These young anarchists, often educated in rationalist schools like the
"<a   href="Ferrer_Modern_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ferrer Modern School">"Ferrer Modern School</a>, produced
English-language publications to reach beyond ethnic enclaves.

#### Vanguard Group

The **Vanguard group** formed in New York at the end of 1931, consisting
of ten young working-class anarchists and their mentor Mark Schmidt.
With an average age of just under 22, they published *Vanguard: A
Libertarian Communist Journal* beginning in April 1932.[^13]

The group explicitly criticized older comrades who were "cooped up
within the confines of little national colonies" and risked relegating
anarchism to "the museum of antiquities." Their declaration of
principles proclaimed: "there is a new type of youth coming to the fore
in American life; Rebellious, critical, iconoclastic, and contemptuous
of the smug generalities of the older generation."[^14]

*Vanguard* maintained high theoretical standards while critiquing both
capitalism and the growing influence of
"<a   href="Stalinism.md" class="wikilink" title="Stalinism">"Stalinism</a>.
The journal devoted significant space to developments in Spain during
the civil war and maintained an uncompromising anarcho-communist
position. At its peak in 1938, *Vanguard* claimed 6,000
subscribers.[^15]

The Vanguard group also supported the **Rebel Youth**, a teenage wing
that published its own newspaper *Rebel Youth* between 1933 and 1934,
using anarchist literature to promote discussion and political education
among young people.[^16]

#### Challenge

**Challenge** emerged in 1938 after Abe Bluestein returned from
Barcelona disillusioned with CNT-FAI compromises. Published weekly and
priced at five cents, *Challenge* described itself as "the fighting
organ for those workers who do not want to be hoodwinked, oppressed by
'Economic Royalists' or dominated by dictators and politicians – left,
right or center."[^17]

The newspaper included a youth section providing information on
establishing a "Libertarian Youth Federation" inspired by the FIJL
model. Unlike *Spanish Revolution*, *Challenge* took a more critical
stance toward anarchist participation in government, though it
ultimately tempered its criticism out of solidarity with the Spanish
movement's difficult position.[^18]

*Challenge* achieved remarkable regularity for an anarchist periodical,
appearing late only twice in its 68 issues, and maintained a circulation
of approximately 5,000.[^19]

### Common Characteristics

Anarchist youth movements across different countries shared several
characteristics:

**Independence**: Youth organizations consistently sought autonomy from
parent organizations while maintaining solidarity with the broader
movement. This independence allowed them to maintain ideological purity
during periods when adult organizations made compromises.

**Publications**: Periodicals served as crucial organizing tools,
creating networks connecting activists across geographic boundaries,
providing theoretical education, and maintaining movement cohesion. As
one analysis noted, periodicals were "vital in forging links between
activists and shaping activist identities" in the absence of formal
institutional structures like political parties.[^20]

**Language Barriers**: Second-generation anarchists in immigrant
communities faced the challenge of their parents' insularity. The
failure of a Midwest Anarchist Conference in the late 1920s exemplified
this problem, with one observer noting: "the Italians don't believe in
conventions and the two Jews are not on speaking terms."[^21]

**Financial Precarity**: Youth publications operated on minimal budgets,
relying on sales and donations. Many ceased publication due to lack of
funds rather than lack of interest or commitment.

**Cultural Activity**: Youth groups organized dances, picnics, lectures,
and social events that combined fundraising with community building.
These events were "as good an occasion as any to stage a politically
subversive exhibition, to state the groups' oppositional character in an
open space, and to display solidarity and defiance."[^22]

## Organization

The FIJL maintained a federalist structure consistent with anarchist
principles of organization. Regional groups federated into a peninsular
organization coordinated by a committee, with decisions made through
plenums and congresses that respected local autonomy while enabling
coordinated action.

The organization emphasized both practical struggle and theoretical
development, combining street-level organizing with serious engagement
with anarchist philosophy and current events. This dual focus
distinguished libertarian youth from both reformist youth movements and
authoritarian socialist youth organizations.

## Criticism

The evolution toward insurrectionism in the early 2000s drew criticism
from anarcho-syndicalists who argued this represented a departure from
the organization's historic commitment to mass organizing and workplace
struggle. The split between insurrectionist and syndicalist tendencies
reflected broader debates within global anarchism about strategy and
tactics.

Some critics argued that the FIJL's independence, while ideologically
valuable, sometimes limited its practical effectiveness by fragmenting
anarchist youth organizing. However, supporters maintained that this
independence was precisely what allowed the organization to avoid the
compromises that damaged the CNT and FAI during the civil war.
