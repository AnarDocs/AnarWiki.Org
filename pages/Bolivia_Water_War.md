> At the end of the ‘90s, the World Bank threatened not to renew a major
> loan on which the Bolivian government depended if they did not agree
> to privatize all water services in the city of Cochabamba. The
> government conceded and signed a contract with a consortium headed up
> by corporations from England, Italy, Spain, the US, and Bolivia. The
> water consortium, lacking knowledge of local conditions, immediately
> raised the rates, to the point where many families had to pay a fifth
> of their monthly earnings just for water. On top of this they enforced
> a policy of shutting off the water of any household that did not pay.
> In January 2000, major protests erupted against the water
> privatization. Primarily indigenous peasants converged on the city,
> joined by retired workers, sweatshop employees, street vendors,
> homeless youth, students, and anarchists. Protestors seized the
> central plaza and barricaded major roads. They organized a general
> strike which paralyzed the city for four days. On February 4 a major
> protest march was attacked by police and soldiers. Two hundred
> demonstrators were arrested, while seventy people and fifty-one cops
> were injured.
>
> In April people again seized the central plaza of Cochabamba, and when
> the government began arresting organizers, protests spread to the
> cities of La Paz, Oruro, and Potosí, as well as many rural villages.
> Most major highways throughout the country were blockaded. On April 8,
> the Bolivian president declared a 90 day state of siege, banning
> meetings of more than 4 people, restricting political activity,
> allowing arbitrary arrests, establishing curfews, and putting the
> radio stations under military control. Police occasionally joined the
> demonstrators to demand higher pay, even participating in some riots.
> Once the government raised their salaries, they returned to work and
> continued beating and arresting their erstwhile comrades. Across the
> country people fought against the police and military with stones and
> molotov cocktails, suffering many injuries and multiple deaths. On
> April 9, soldiers trying to remove a roadblock encountered resistance
> and shot two protestors to death, injuring several others. Neighbors
> attacked the soldiers, seized their weapons, and opened fire. Later
> they stormed a hospital and seized an army captain they had wounded,
> and lynched him.
>
> As violent protests only showed signs of growing despite, and often
> because of, repeated killings and violent repression by the police and
> military, the state cancelled its contract with the water consortium
> and on April 11 annulled the law that had authorized the privatization
> of water in Cochabamba. Management of the water infrastructure was
> turned over to a community coordinating group that had arisen from the
> protest movement. Some participants in the struggle subsequently
> travelled to Washington, D.C. to join antiglobalization protestors in
> the demonstration intended to shut down the annual World Bank
> meeting.[^1]

> The complaints of the protestors moved far beyond water privatization
> in one city. The resistance had generalized to a social rebellion that
> included socialist rejections of neoliberalism, anarchist rejections
> of capitalism, farmers’ rejections of their debts, poor people’s
> demands for lower fuel prices and the end of multinational ownership
> of Bolivia’s gas, and indigenous demands for sovereignty. Similarly
> fierce resistance in subsequent years defeated Bolivia’s political
> elite on a number of occasions. Farmers and anarchists armed with
> dynamite took over banks to win the forgiveness of their debts. Under
> intense popular pressure, the government nationalized the extraction
> of gas, and a powerful union of indigenous farmers defeated the
> US-backed program of coca eradication. The coca farmers even got their
> leader, Evo Morales, elected president, giving Bolivia its first
> indigenous head of state. Because of this, Bolivia is currently facing
> a political crisis the government may be incapable of resolving, as
> the traditional elite, located in the white, eastern areas of the
> country, refuse to submit to the progressive policies of the Morales
> government. In the rural areas, indigenous communities used more
> direct means to preserve their autonomy. They continued blockading
> highways, and sabotaged attempts of government control of their
> villages through daily acts of resistance. On no fewer than a dozen
> occasions when a particular mayor or other government official proved
> especially intrusive or abusive, he would be lynched by the villagers.
