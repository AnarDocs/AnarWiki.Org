**Buurtzorg Nederland** is a
<a href="Healthcare_in_the_Netherlands" class="wikilink"
title="Dutch">Dutch</a> home-care organization that demonstrates many
<a href="Anarchist" class="wikilink" title="Anarchist">Anarchist</a>
principles in practice, including
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>,
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and <a href="Anti-Authoritarianism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> organizing. Founded in
2006, the organization has grown to over 10,000 nurses working in 850
self-managing teams, providing community-based healthcare while
rejecting traditional hierarchical management structures.

The name *buurtzorg* translates to "neighborhood care" in Dutch,
reflecting the organization's emphasis on

<a href="Decentralization" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a> organizing.

## Origins

Buurtzorg was founded in 2006 in
<a href="Almelo" class="wikilink" title="Almelo">Almelo</a> by Jos de
Blok and three other professional nurses who became disillusioned with
the <a href="Bureaucracy" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucratic">bureaucratic</a> and profit-driven healthcare
system that had emerged in the Netherlands.[^1] The Dutch healthcare
reforms of the 1990s had introduced
<a href="New_Public_Management" class="wikilink"
title="New Public Management">New Public Management</a> principles that
stripped nurses of professional autonomy and fragmented care into
standardized tasks allocated by external bureaucrats.

This transformation exemplified what
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
critique about
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
and <a href="State" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>
intervention in natural human relationships - the reduction of caring
work to profit-maximizing "products" delivered by interchangeable
workers rather than relationships between whole human beings.[^2]

## Organizational Structure

### Self-Managing Teams

Buurtzorg operates through teams of 10-12 highly skilled nurses who
collectively manage all aspects of their work without traditional
managers or supervisors. Each team serves approximately 50 patients in a
geographically defined neighborhood, embodying the anarchist principle
of
<a href="Federation" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a> -
autonomous units cooperating without centralized control.[^3]

Teams are responsible for:

- Patient intake and assessment
- Scheduling and vacation planning
- Administrative tasks
- Choosing office locations and workspace design
- Recruitment and hiring decisions
- Community relationship building
- Performance monitoring and improvement

This structure eliminates the traditional employer-employee hierarchy
that anarchists view as inherently exploitative, instead creating
<a href="Workers&#39;_Cooperative" class="wikilink"
title="cooperative">cooperative</a> relationships where workers control
their own labor.[^4]

### Decision-Making Process

Buurtzorg teams use a <a href="Consensus" class="wikilink"
title="consensus-based">consensus-based</a> decision-making method
called "Solution-Driven Methods of Interaction." The process involves:

- Choosing a rotating facilitator who can only ask questions, not make
  statements
- Listing all proposals on a flipchart
- Reviewing and refining proposals collectively
- Adopting solutions based on consent rather than consensus - meaning no
  principled objections rather than universal enthusiasm

This approach reflects anarchist principles of
<a href="Direct_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and
<a href="Prefigurative_Politics" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a> - creating the
more egalitarian world anarchists envision through present practice.[^5]

### Conflict Resolution

The organization has developed sophisticated approaches to handling
conflict without relying on external authorities or punitive measures.
When trust breaks down within a team, members first attempt
collaborative resolution. If unsuccessful, they may request a regional
coach or external mediator to facilitate discussion.[^6]

Only as a final resort can teams ask founder Jos de Blok to mediate or
end someone's contract. This process demonstrates
<a href="Restorative_Justice" class="wikilink"
title="restorative">restorative</a> rather than punitive approaches to
workplace conflict, consistent with anarchist critiques of punitive
authority.

## Anarchist Principles in Practice

### Mutual Aid

Buurtzorg's care model exemplifies
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
by:

- Training patients and families in self-care to reduce dependence
- Mobilizing informal networks of neighbors, friends, and community
  organizations
- Nurses providing emotional and social support beyond medical tasks
- Sharing knowledge freely between teams through BuurtzorgWeb platform

This approach recognizes that human wellbeing emerges from strong
community relationships rather than professional service provision,
aligning with anarchist theory about
<a href="Community" class="wikilink" title="community">community</a>
resilience.

### Anti-Authoritarianism

The organization consciously rejects traditional management hierarchies:

- No middle management layer between teams and leadership
- Teams cannot be ordered to adopt new practices - innovations spread
  organically if they prove valuable
- Regional coaches have no decision-making authority over teams
- Information transparency rather than surveillance for performance
  management

### Decentralization

With 850 teams serving local neighborhoods, Buurtzorg demonstrates how
complex organizations can operate without centralized control. The
headquarters employs only 45 people (compared to thousands in comparable
organizations) for administrative functions like payroll, allowing
maximum autonomy for frontline workers.[^7]

## Outcomes

Buurtzorg has achieved remarkable results that challenge assumptions
about the necessity of hierarchical organization:

**Patient Outcomes:**

- Patient satisfaction scores 30% above national average (9.1/10)
- Patients receive care for average 5.5 months vs 7.5 months industry
  standard
- Hospital admissions reduced by one-third with shorter average stays

**Worker Outcomes:**

- Staff satisfaction of 8.7/10 with 9.5/10 for involvement
- Won Dutch "Best Employer" award four times between 2010-2016
- Staff turnover of 10% vs 15% industry average
- Sickness absence rates half the industry average

**Economic Outcomes:**

- 40% reduction in care hours per patient compared to traditional
  providers[^8]
- Overhead costs of 8% vs 25% industry average
- Estimated potential savings of €2 billion annually if model expanded
  nationally

## International Expansion

The Buurtzorg model has spread to over 24 countries, demonstrating the
universal applicability of anarchist organizing principles. Notably, Jos
de Blok freely shares organizational knowledge with competitors,
reflecting anarchist values of <a href="Commons" class="wikilink"
title="commons-based">commons-based</a> rather than proprietary
approaches to innovation.[^9]

## Criticism

Some critics argue that Buurtzorg's success depends on the specific
cultural context of the Netherlands and may not translate to other
healthcare systems. Others point to higher medical follow-up costs for
Buurtzorg patients as evidence that savings may be shifted rather than
eliminated.

From an anarchist perspective, the organization still operates within
capitalist market structures and receives government funding, limiting
its ability to fully challenge the systems that create health inequities
in the first place.

## Significance for Anarchist Theory

Buurtzorg provides concrete evidence that large-scale organizations can
operate effectively using anarchist principles of
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="self-management">self-management</a>,
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and <a href="Anti-Authoritarianism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-hierarchy">anti-hierarchy</a>. The organization demonstrates
how rejecting managerial control can simultaneously improve outcomes for
workers, service users, and broader society.

The model challenges both capitalist assumptions about the necessity of
hierarchical control for efficiency and statist assumptions about the
need for bureaucratic regulation to ensure quality services. Instead, it
shows how autonomous workers with appropriate skills and resources can
self-organize to meet human needs more effectively than traditional
institutional forms.
