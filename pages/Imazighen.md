Harold Barclay, People Without Government[^1]:

> Throughout the Middle East there are several different ethnic groups
> which have been referred to as 'inhabiting lands of insolence' because
> they live in defiance of centralised government authority. They are
> 'tribally' organised, with patrilineages and highly decen­tralised,
> acephalous polities. Imazighen who dwell in northern Algeria and in
> the Moroccan highlands probably demonstrate the more anarchic of these
> peoples. A most appropriate example is the so-called 'Kabyle' -
> Imazighen farmers of northern Algeria and a group noted with favour by
> Kropotkin.
>
> The fundamental social unit in Kabyle society is the family household.
> Several adjacent households comprise a neighbourhood within a village
> and this is equivalent to a common patrilineage, although it may
> include persons who are not true kinsmen. The patrilineage, in sum, is
> a constituent of a clan. Ordinarily there are two clans in a village
> each identified with a sof or moiety - that is, one particular half of
> the village. Villages are independent entities. From ten to 20
> comprise a tribe, but this has no effective function , being at best a
> voluntary association or alliance called into being on rare occasions
> for mutual defence. About a dozen tribes are to be found in Kabylia.
>
> Each lineage in a village has a chief spokesperson who participates in
> a village council which deliberates on all matters of communal
> importance: legislating, mediating and judging. The council is
> expected to defend the honour of the community and to see to it that
> its decisions are carried out. Here, as in other cases encountered in
> this survey, we may note the weakness of true governmental features
> since there are no specific policemen. Rather the council usually
> seeks to mediate between disputants trying to find some basis for
> compromise and exhorting them to reach an agreement. Once again the
> aim seems to be not so much to determine guilt as to re-establish
> group harmony. The council is, in fact, the voice of public opinion
> and communal sanctions, since it is composed of representatives of
> each kin group, also because it acts only when agreement is unanimous,
> that is, by consensus. The two primary forms of punishment which may
> be imposed by this body are banishment from the village and ostracism.
> The council, as has been said, is essentially the voice of village
> public opinion and if it chooses to ostracise a fellow villager, all
> others tend to fall in line to enforce the punishment which is seen as
> a symbolic putting to death. Similar diffuse and collective sanctions
> operate in banishing a member.
>
> The collective oath is resorted to as a final resort, when every other
> method of settlement has failed. This entails the members of a group
> jointly swearing to the truth of their claims on pain of the wrath of
> God if perjury is committed. Thus a refusal to swear is an admission
> of guilt.
>
> Aside from the council of the whole village, the males of a lineage on
> occasion may meet as a body, but more important is the council of the
> clan which controls the time of commencement of various seasonal
> activities such as the beginning of ploughing, harvesting and other
> communal labour, as well as the religious festivals. Throughout,
> councils always operate on the basis of a well-known collection of
> customary regulations peculiar to the village. These delineate the
> recognised 'crimes' and their appropriate punishments. In addition
> councils are guided by a Kabyle code of honour.
>
> Bourdieu calls the Kabyle system a 'gentilitial democracy' since it is
> a group of kinsmen who administer their lives through an assembly of
> all the 'fathers' in the village. Yet it seems to lack some essential
> attributes of democracy. First, the majority does not rule: consensus
> is the basis for decision-making. Secondly, ideally at least, power is
> so decentralised that every kin group in the community is represented.
> Delegation of authority, a characteristic of democracy, can hardly be
> said to exist. Thirdly, enforcement of decisions is not through
> policemen and the council is not a judicial body so much as it is a
> mediatory one. Ultimate power rests in the expression of the diffuse
> sanctions of the community. Finally, the social intercourse is more in
> the nature of a relationship between kinsmen than it is a political
> affair. In these respects then we have an institution which seems more
> anarchic than it is democratic.
>
> Among Moroccan Imazighen a patrilineage system along with the
> respective councils is also characteristic. Yet the structure at the
> higher levels of integration is more distinct and powerful, such that
> tribal councils are clearly in evidence as governing bodies. A tribal
> council consists of the patriarchs from each of the several clans
> which make up the tribe. These patriarchs, who are similar to Big Men,
> often constitute a kind of nobility from which the higher nobility or
> chiefs are drawn and these are entrusted with the affairs of the whole
> tribe. If the council cannot agree on a chief, one is selected by lot.
>
> In some parts of Morocco an important political device is the alliance
> in which a patriarch and his followers, who include members of his
> extended family as well as those who may not be related to hm,
> affiliate with others as a lift. Feuding within the tribe can be
> controlled, since if one clan attacks another, this would be the call
> for the members of the alliance to come to the aid of their brethren.
> And of course members of the same alliance do not feud with each
> other. As long as the alliances remain strong, a tribal chiefs power
> is curtailed since booty acquired in fighting has to be shared by all
> members of an alliance.
>
> Occasionally a tribal chief is able to secure an adequate following
> with sufficient fire power so that he can impose his will on his tribe
> and extend it over others. This invariable entails his being able to
> gain control of the two alliances, and to assassinate rival chiefs as
> well as to provoke local conflict which he might manipulate to his
> advantage. After gaining domination over an area he could then seek to
> reinforce his position by being appointed a qaid (agent) by the
> Moroccan sultan. Whether or not he is able to ascend this far on the
> ladder of political success, his autocratic rule is usually
> short-lived. Establishing a dynasty is next to impossible due to the
> fact that the chief is faced with constant revolt which ultimately
> becomes successful and returns the system to the old decentralised
> anarchic order. In any event, the system creates the rudiments of
> government and a tenuous autocratic state structure. It provides an
> historical process of cyclic oscillation between archy and anarchy.
>
> Some Moroccan Imazighen have an interesting mediation technique. While
> minor disputes are left to the local chiefs and councils, major
> disputes involving members of differing tribes are submitted to 'holy
> men' or Igurramen. These hereditary saints are ideally descendants of
> the Prophet and so possess baraka or holiness. They have magical
> powers and are known to be good and pious men. They do not fight, or
> engage in feuds or litigation, but are non-combatants and permanently
> neutral pacifists who comprise their own separate patrilineages. They
> are the mediators between potentially hostile groups. Aside from this
> task they supervise the election of chiefs among the several tribes in
> their vicinity, provide sanctuary, protection for strangers and act as
> centres of information.
>
> An important part of their mediator judicial role is to witness
> collective oaths. As was mentioned for the Kabyle, the collective oath
> is deemed effective because one swears on pain of divine punishment
> should perjury be committed. But Gellner suggests that this is not
> ultimately the reason for the effectiveness of this method of
> adjudication, since individuals do perjure themselves. To Gellner the
> effectiveness of the collective oath is that if a group wishes to
> stand behind one of its own it will be able to do so ; it will swear
> collectively to the innocence of the alleged culprit. But it can also
> use the mechanism to punish one of its own who is too much of a
> trouble-maker, by some or all of his kinsmen refusing to take the oath
> in which case the plaintiff wins.
>
> The saints are mediators of disputes, not judges, since they cannot
> enforce their decisions, but depend upon the acceptance of the verdict
> by those involved . Those who refuse to abide by a verdict face
> considerable danger due to the moral authority of the saints. Public
> opinion and especially that of the saints and their clients would be
> turned against such persons.
>
> In addition to the fact that Imazighen society may be characterised by
> a hierarchical structure which distinguishes prestigious tribal
> council members from lesser lights, there is a more clear cut class or
> even caste-like division. Thus Imazighen have a small population of
> slaves. In addition tiny communities of Jews have resided in the land
> and these too have been a subordinate 'pariah' caste. Among some
> Imazighen, such as those of the desert oases, there has existed a
> Haratin caste of serf cultivators, usually having distinct Negroid

> regimes. They are suggestive as well of interesting non-governmental
> techniques for social control. Recent decades, in part because of
> improved military technology, have brought all Imazighen much more
