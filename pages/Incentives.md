# Incentives

**Incentives** are mechanisms designed to influence behavior by offering
rewards or imposing costs. From an anarchist perspective, the design and
implementation of incentive systems reveal fundamental questions about
power, autonomy, and social organization. While capitalist and statist
societies rely heavily on coercive incentives (the profit motive, legal
punishment) and manipulative techniques (nudging, choice architecture),
anarchist alternatives emphasize intrinsic motivation, mutual aid, and
freely chosen cooperation.

## Types of Incentive Systems

### Capitalist Incentives

In capitalist systems, the primary incentive structure revolves around
the **profit motive**—the drive to maximize financial gain.[^1] This
creates a society where:

- **Survival depends on monetary exchange**: People work primarily to
  earn money for basic needs, not from intrinsic interest or community
  benefit
- **Wealth accumulation becomes the measure of success**: Social status,
  power, and security are tied to financial assets
- **Competition replaces cooperation**: Individuals and firms compete
  against each other rather than collaborate for collective wellbeing

Critics argue the profit motive leads to exploitation, environmental
destruction, and the subordination of human needs to capital
accumulation. As Michael Moore argued regarding healthcare: "We should
have no talk of profit when it comes to helping people who are sick. The
profit motive should be nowhere involved in this."[^2]

### State-Based Incentives

State systems employ both **positive incentives** (tax breaks,
subsidies, public recognition) and **negative incentives** (fines,
imprisonment, loss of rights). Anarchists criticize these as:

- **Coercive by nature**: State incentives ultimately rest on the threat
  of violence
- **Hierarchical**: Designed by elites to control populations
- **Alienating**: They treat people as subjects to be managed rather
  than autonomous agents

### Libertarian Paternalism and Nudging

**Libertarian paternalism** and **nudging** represent a supposedly
"soft" approach to behavioral control. Developed by Richard Thaler and
Cass Sunstein, these techniques involve designing "choice architecture"
to steer people toward particular decisions while preserving the
appearance of free choice.[^3]

Examples include:

- Setting organ donation to "opt-out" rather than "opt-in"
- Placing healthy foods at eye level in cafeterias
- Default enrollment in retirement savings plans
- Framing tax payments as "contributions" rather than "obligations"

#### Anarchist Critique of Nudging

From an anarchist perspective, nudging is problematic for several
reasons:

**1. Hidden Manipulation**: While presented as preserving "freedom of
choice," nudges are explicitly designed to manipulate behavior without
the subject's conscious awareness. This violates principles of
transparency and informed consent.

**2. Technocratic Elitism**: Nudging requires "choice architects" who
decide what behaviors are desirable for others. This creates a class of
experts with power over ordinary people, replicating hierarchical
structures.

**3. Circumventing Genuine Autonomy**: Rather than helping people
develop critical thinking and make genuinely autonomous decisions,
nudging bypasses rational deliberation to produce predetermined
outcomes.

**4. Susceptible to Authoritarian Abuse**: The same techniques used to
encourage healthy eating can be deployed by authoritarian governments
for social control, as seen in the 1938 Austrian Anschluss referendum
and 1978 Chilean consultation, where ballot design "nudged" voters
toward desired outcomes.[^4]

**5. Addressing Symptoms, Not Causes**: Nudging accepts existing power
structures and tries to modify individual behavior within them, rather
than challenging the systemic causes of problems.

As critics note, "nudging is also a euphemism for psychological
manipulation as practiced in social engineering."[^5]

## Behavioral Engineering: The Case of Walden Two

B.F. Skinner's 1948 novel *Walden Two* presents a utopian community
based on **behavioral engineering**—the systematic application of
operant conditioning to shape human behavior.[^6] The community's
founder, Frazier, designs an environment where:

- Children are raised communally using "behavioral engineering"
  techniques
- A "Walden Code" encourages members to credit achievements to the
  community rather than individuals
- Work assignments operate on a credit system rewarding unpleasant tasks
  with more leisure time
- A small group of "Planners" design the social structure based on
  behavioral science

### Anarchist Concerns with Walden Two

While Skinner presented Walden Two as non-coercive, anarchists identify
several troubling features:

**1. Technocratic Control**: Despite claims of avoiding
authoritarianism, Walden Two relies on behavioral experts (Planners and
Scientists) who design the environment to produce predetermined
outcomes. As one critic noted, Frazier "has sole control over the
political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work,
education, and sleep."[^7]

**2. Manufactured Consent**: The community produces compliance through
environmental manipulation rather than genuine voluntary agreement.
Members are "engineered" to want what the system needs them to want.

**3. Rejection of Autonomy**: The system explicitly rejects free will
and human agency, viewing people as purely products of environmental
conditioning. This contradicts anarchist emphasis on self-determination.

**4. Rigid Social Engineering**: Despite rhetoric about experimentation,
the fundamental structure (behavioral conditioning by experts) remains
fixed. This limits genuine social innovation.

**5. Philosopher-King Problem**: Like Plato's Republic, Walden Two
requires wise, benevolent rulers (the Planners) who somehow remain
uncorrupted by their power over others.

Real-world attempts to create Walden Two communities, such as Twin Oaks,
have largely abandoned Skinner's behavioral engineering model while
retaining some cooperative economic structures.

## Anarchist Alternatives: Incentives in The Dispossessed

Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* (1974) offers a compelling
contrast by depicting an anarchist society (Anarres) where incentives
function without state coercion or capitalist accumulation. The novel
contrasts two worlds:

### Urras (Capitalist/State Society)

On the propertarian planet Urras, incentives include:

- **Financial need and profit**: Work is motivated primarily by money
  and material accumulation
- **Social status and power**: Wealth grants influence and domination
  over others
- **Careerism**: Professional advancement and recognition drive
  scientific work
- **Security**: Fear of poverty and precarious existence compels
  compliance

### Anarres (Anarchist Society)

On the anarchist moon Anarres, where money and government don't exist,
incentives are fundamentally different:

- **Pride and enjoyment in work**: People work because they find
  intrinsic satisfaction in contributing
- **Mutual aid**: Strong sense of collective responsibility motivates
  necessary work, especially during crises
- **Social solidarity**: Desire for peer approval and fear of being seen
  as a "shirker" provide social regulation without coercion
- **Individual initiative**: Freedom to pursue passions and form
  voluntary work syndicates
- **Freedom itself**: The pursuit of genuine freedom—not just freedom
  from want, but freedom to act—is a core motivation
- **The permanent revolution**: Drive to prevent stagnation and
  continually realize founding ideals

Le Guin's novel demonstrates how anarchist incentive systems can be:

- **Intrinsic rather than extrinsic**: Motivated by internal
  satisfaction rather than external rewards
- **Social rather than individual**: Based on relationships and
  community rather than isolated self-interest
- **Ethical rather than material**: Grounded in values and principles
  rather than accumulation
- **Dynamic rather than fixed**: Encouraging innovation and preventing
  calcification

Importantly, Le Guin doesn't romanticize Anarres—she shows how even
anarchist societies can develop informal hierarchies and bureaucratic
tendencies that must be continually challenged.

## The Myth of Rational Self-Interest

### Ayn Rand's Egoism

Ayn Rand's *The Virtue of Selfishness* (1964) presents perhaps the most
extreme defense of self-interest as a moral principle. Rand argues that:

- Selfishness is "a moral good"
- Each person must act as "the beneficiary of his action"
- Altruism is immoral because it subordinates the individual to others

### Anarchist Critique

Anarchists reject Rand's framework for multiple reasons:

**1. False Dichotomy**: Rand presents a false choice between dominating
selfishness and self-sacrificing altruism, ignoring the reality of
mutual aid, where helping others also benefits oneself.

**2. Justification for Exploitation**: By elevating self-interest above
all else, Rand's philosophy provides moral cover for exploitation,
property accumulation, and refusal to address systemic injustice.

**3. Ignores Social Nature of Humanity**: Humans are fundamentally
social beings whose wellbeing depends on relationships and community.
Pure self-interest is neither possible nor desirable.

**4. Confuses Autonomy with Isolation**: Rand mistakes individual
autonomy (which anarchists support) for atomized selfishness (which
anarchists opposes). True autonomy emerges through free association, not
isolation.

**5. Naturalizes Capitalism**: By presenting self-interest as a timeless
human nature, Rand obscures how current economic systems actively create
and reward selfish behavior while punishing cooperation.

As Kropotkin demonstrated in \*Mutual Aid\*, cooperation and solidarity
have been far more important to human evolution and survival than
competitive self-interest. The widespread existence of cooperative
behaviors—from childcare to barn-raising to labor unions—shows that
humans are naturally inclined toward mutual support when not constrained
by hierarchical systems.

## Toward Anarchist Incentive Systems

Anarchist approaches to incentives emphasize:

### 1. Intrinsic Motivation

Rather than external rewards or punishments, anarchist systems cultivate
internal drives:

- Joy in creative work
- Satisfaction from helping others
- Pride in craft and excellence
- Curiosity and learning

### 2. Social Solidarity

Community bonds provide motivation without coercion:

- Mutual respect and recognition
- Reciprocity within gift economies
- Desire to maintain relationships
- Collective problem-solving

### 3. Direct Democracy

When people participate in decisions that affect them, they're motivated
to implement those decisions:

- No division between rulers and ruled
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Consensus and federation
- Right of exit from associations

### 4. Meeting Needs Directly

When basic needs are met unconditionally, people are free to pursue
higher motivations:

- Guaranteed access to food, housing, healthcare
- Commons-based resource sharing
- From each according to ability, to each according to need
- Reduction of bullshit jobs

### 5. Cultural Transformation

Changing the stories we tell about human nature and society:

- Education for critical thinking, not obedience
- Art and media that celebrate cooperation
- Rituals and traditions supporting solidarity
- Languages that encode mutual aid (as in Pravic, the language of
  Anarres)

## Conclusion

Incentive systems reflect and reproduce fundamental social relations.
Capitalist incentives based on profit and accumulation create
exploitation and alienation. State incentives based on rewards and
punishments maintain hierarchical control. Manipulative techniques like
nudging preserve elite power while appearing to respect choice.

Anarchist alternatives demonstrate that humans can be motivated by
intrinsic satisfaction, social solidarity, and ethical principles when
freed from coercive structures. Rather than engineering behavior through
hidden manipulation or overt force, anarchist incentive systems aim to
create conditions where people freely choose cooperation because it
genuinely serves their wellbeing and that of their communities.

The challenge is not to design perfect incentive systems that produce
predetermined outcomes, but to create spaces where people can
experiment, learn, and collectively develop ways of living that honor
both individual autonomy and social interdependence. As \*The
Dispossessed\* reminds us, this requires constant vigilance against the
tendency for any system—even an anarchist one—to calcify into new forms
of domination.
