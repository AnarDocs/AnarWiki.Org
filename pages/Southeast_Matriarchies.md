"The great Native American civilizations of the Southeast of the
present-day United States—importantly including the

Choctaw, Chickasaw, Muscogee, and
"<a   href="Seminole_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Seminole">Seminole</a>—were
matriarchal societies. In them, women, as equals of the men, had power
and influence. All of this changed with the coming of the Europeans, who
assumed that Native people lived as Europeans did, in patriarchal
systems, in which elite men defined the ‘appropriate way’ for women to
behave. They failed to understand the equality of the sexes in Native
American so- cieties, where women enjoyed high economic, social, and
political status."[^1]

# Muscogee

Since at least the 6th century CE, the Muscogee people and their
ancestors have made decisions through consensus-based councils. That
century saw the appearance of circular "council houses" able to fit
hundreds of people. The council structure "provides a formalized space
for decisions of community councils, regional councils, clan mothers,
beloved men and women, and other community members drawn from a diverse
set of autonomous institutions." Decisions were guided by the "laws of
nature". A council executive known as a *Mekko* with no authority
outside of the council, was chosen "on the basis of personal qualities,
competency, and potential to effectively take on the responsibilities of
the role." Although there were village councils, multi-village local
councils, and regional councils, there was no hierarchy of "higher"
councils over "lower" ones.[^2]
