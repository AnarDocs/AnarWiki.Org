# Market Anarchism

**Market anarchism** is the branch of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a>
that advocates a "<a   href="free-market.md" class="wikilink"
title="free-market">"free-market</a>
"<a   href="economic_system.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic system">"economic system</a> based on voluntary
interactions without the involvement of the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a>; a
form of "<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">"individualist anarchism</a>.[^1]

Due to contending definitions of the terms 'markets' and 'capitalism'
which are not used by free-market anti-capitalists,[^2]
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">"anarcho-capitalism</a> has been referred to
synonymously as "free-market anarchism," but the ideologies differ
significantly.[^3][^4][^5][^6]

The Center for a Stateless Society (C4SS), which
"<a   href="Kevin_Carson.md" class="wikilink" title="Kevin Carson">"Kevin
Carson</a> is associated with, is one such group of free-marked
anti-capitalists.[^7] As is
"<a   href="Samuel_Edward_Konkin_III.md" class="wikilink"
title="Samuel Edward Konkin III">"Samuel Edward Konkin III</a>'s
"<a   href="agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="agorism">"agorism</a>, a
tendency associated with left-libertarianism.[^8]

## Origins

Market anarchism emerged from the
"<a   href="individualist_anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">"individualist anarchist</a> tradition of
the 19th century, drawing on the work of thinkers who sought to combine
anti-state politics with free-market economics. The movement
distinguishes itself from "<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">"anarcho-capitalism</a> by rejecting what it
sees as the capitalist emphasis on private property in land and capital
accumulation through wage labor.

## Tendencies

Market anarchism encompasses several related but distinct approaches:

- **"<a   href="Mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
  title="Mutualism">"Mutualism</a>** - Based on the work of
  "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, emphasizing
  mutual aid and cooperative ownership
- **"<a   href="Agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="Agorism">"Agorism</a>** -
  "<a   href="Samuel_Edward_Konkin_III.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Samuel Edward Konkin III">"Samuel Edward Konkin III</a>'s
  strategy of counter-economics and black market activity
- **Geo-libertarianism** - Combining free markets with
  "<a   href="Georgism.md" class="wikilink" title="Georgist">"Georgist</a> land
  value taxation principles
- **Left-libertarianism** - Market-oriented approaches that emphasize
  social justice and opposition to corporate privilege

## Criticism

Market anarchism faces criticism from multiple directions. Traditional
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communists">"anarcho-communists</a> argue that any market
system will inevitably lead to inequality and exploitation. Some
"<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">"Marxist</a> critics
argue that market mechanisms are inherently capitalist and cannot be
separated from capitalist social relations.

Critics also point to fundamental problems with markets as information
and distribution systems. Markets communicate the needs of people only
in a delayed, indirect, and distorted way. The information about
products gets mostly reduced to a single number - the price - which
adapts to purchases rather than actual consumption or need. This means
speculation and hoarding can skew prices, as can monopolies.

Markets incentivize hiding important information such as environmental
impact or production conditions. They tend to result in externalized
environmental damage through negative externalities that are not
accounted for in prices. Products must perform well on the market and
often break soon afterward rather than fulfilling genuine needs, as
production focuses on exchange value rather than use value.

The market system creates coordination problems between producers. If
company A plans to change their production requiring more of product X,
the price of X will increase until company B increases production. With
markets, company A won't communicate their plans to company B in order
to profit from lower prices, whereas direct communication could avoid
shortages entirely.

Markets have no inherent societal goal - they do not guarantee that all
needs are met. They require active participation through wage labor,
product research, and potentially bargaining, thus excluding those who
cannot fit these requirements. Many anarchist critics argue these
systemic issues make markets incompatible with genuine liberation and
equality.[^9]
