Located in the inland Niger Delta of modern-day Mali from 250 BCE to
1400 CE, the Jenne-jeno (meaning ancient Jenne) civilization was
stateless, decentralized, and showed no obvious economic inequality. The
city had over 11,000 people into 12 square kilometers.[^1]

Based on the distribution of settlements into tight clusters,
archeologist Susan Keech McIntosh argues that there was political
decentralization with relatively autonomous neighborhoods uniting in
loose federations.[^2] The civilization did not become dependent on
domesticated cereals at the expense of wild ones,[^3] meaning that they
didn't become overly dependent on crops that are easily legible and
taxable by states.

Residents ate wild brachiaria and domestic rice, millet and sorghum,
along with meat from domestic cows, sheep, goats and from wild antelope
and water fowl. They lived in pole-and-mat huts until 400 CE and then in
mud-brick huts.[^4]

Jenne-jeno went into decline when it came into contact with North Africa
around 900 CE.[^5]
