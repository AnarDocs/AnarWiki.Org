**Capitalism** is a way of organizing resources and people in order to
produce a
"<a   href="Surplus_Value.md" class="wikilink" title="profit">"profit</a> for
those who control profit-producing capital (such as property). It has
three major traits:

## History

The "<a   href="History_of_Capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="history of capitalism">"history of capitalism</a> is a key area to
understanding how capitalism works and its disturbing history.
Capitalism evolved out of early "<a   href="Mercantilism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mercantilism">"Mercantilism</a> and is characterised by its
"<a   href="Markets.md" class="wikilink" title="market economies">"market
economies</a>.

### Origins and Precursors

Several historical developments created the conditions that birthed
capitalism. The rise of Venetian merchants in the 14th-15th centuries
established advanced trading networks and modern banking systems,
creating a new merchant class. The European voyages of discovery and
"<a   href="Colonialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">"colonialism</a> to the Americas, Africa and Asia
during the 15th-16th centuries allowed the exploitation of new resources
and lands for capital accumulation.

The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century created a new Calvinistic
work ethic that justified individual wealth accumulation. The creation
of
"<a   href="Liberalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Liberalism">"Liberalism</a>
in the 17th-18th centuries provided the philosophical justification for
the kind of individualism necessary for capitalism to operate.

### From Feudalism to Capitalism

Capitalism emerged from
"<a   href="Feudalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Feudalism">"Feudalism</a>,
but the transition was neither smooth nor inevitable. Under feudalism,
lords controlled land and extracted value through rent and feudal
obligations. However, changes in Anglo-Saxon England began transforming
this system, as lords were increasingly required to make profits from
their estates rather than simply extracting traditional dues.

The example of
"<a   href="Madeira.md" class="wikilink" title="Madeira">"Madeira</a> in the
15th century typified early capitalism. Portuguese colonizers
established sugar plantations using enslaved labor, creating one of the
first modern commodity-production systems oriented entirely toward
market profit rather than subsistence or feudal obligation. This model
would be replicated throughout the colonial world, establishing patterns
of exploitation that became central to capitalist development.

### The Glorious Revolution and Private Capital

A crucial turning point came with the
"<a   href="Glorious_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Glorious Revolution">"Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, when the
Bills of Rights became law on 16 December 1689, enshrining modern
property rights. This legal framework enabled private capital ownership
in a fundamentally new way, protecting capital from arbitrary seizure by
monarchs and establishing the legal foundations for corporate ownership.

Before this, capital was held and could be lost at the potential whim of
monarchs under feudalism. The world's first corporation, the English
East India Company, was created on 31 December 1600, but labored for
decades under the precarious situation of competing against feudalism
and the risk of capital being taken by the king.

### Slavery and Enclosure

Two brutal processes were essential for capitalism's growth and survival
in its early stages. The International Africa/European Slave Trade,
particularly from 1518 when it was used for cross-Atlantic labor until
its end in the UK in 1807, gave capitalism captive workers until wage
labor became the norm.

The "<a   href="Enclosure.md" class="wikilink"
title="English Enclosure Acts">"English Enclosure Acts</a> during the
18th-19th centuries created a landless working class by privatizing
"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="common lands">"common lands</a>,
inventing homelessness and insecure wage labor. Peasants who had
previously sustained themselves on common lands were forced into wage
labor to survive, creating the desperate workforce capitalism required.

### Industrial Capitalism

The "<a   href="Industrial_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Revolution">"Industrial Revolution</a> in Britain
during the late 18th to early 19th century moved society from a feudal
rental/produce economy to a commodity one. Capitalism finally reached
full adulthood on 24 June 1846, when the Corn Laws were repealed,
liberalizing trade policies and opening ownership and trade beyond royal
control. For those who believe capitalism cannot exist without 'free'
markets, this date marks its true birth.

By the early 19th century, capitalism had become the dominant economic
system in much of Western Europe and was spreading globally through
colonialism and imperialism.

## Definition

British Anarchist
"<a   href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">"William
Godwin</a> first used 'capitalist' in English in his Political Justice
(1793), describing capitalists as part of "the higher and governing part
of the community" who "take a very disproportionate share of the
produce" and act as "voracious" exploiters who "might, under a different
mode of society, be dispensed with."

The initial use of the term 'capitalism' in its modern sense is
attributed to French "<a   href="Utopian_Socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Utopian Socialist">"Utopian Socialist</a>
"<a   href="Louis_Blanc.md" class="wikilink" title="Louis Blanc">"Louis
Blanc</a> in 1850: "What I call 'capitalism' that is to say the
appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others." French
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchist">"Anarchist</a>
Socialist "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> further
popularized it in 1861: "Economic and social regime in which capital,
the source of income, does not generally belong to those who make it
work through their labour." He had first used the term 'capitalist' in
1840 in *What Is Property?*, using similar imagery to Godwin: "the
robber, is the capitalist who takes all, who gets the lion's share."

From these original definitions, capitalism meant an economic system in
which capital does not belong to the workers, although they often create
it or support it through their labor. Capitalists were understood to be
a superfluous class who take from workers through exploitation. All
three men who gave these early definitions were Socialists and
understood that under capitalism, capital was owned by a few rather than
in the hands of workers and society in general as in
"<a   href="Socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="Socialism">"Socialism</a>.

### Later Definitions

The word gradually entered mainstream dictionaries and encyclopedias by
the early 20th century. The Chambers dictionary defined a capitalist in
1867 as "one who has capital or money," though it wasn't until 1908 that
it added the word capitalism, meaning "condition of possessing capital:
the economic system which generates capitalists."

"<a   href="Adam_Smith.md" class="wikilink" title="Adam Smith">"Adam Smith</a>,
often called the "father of capitalism," never used the word capitalism
himself, as it was invented later by Socialists. Instead he spoke of
"stocks" and "commercial society." His seminal work *The Wealth of
Nations* (1776) described many concepts associated with capitalism,
including private property, markets, self-interest, profit motive,
division of labor, and capital accumulation, though Smith himself was
highly critical of many aspects of the emerging system.

## Anti-Capitalism

Numerous criticisms of capitalism exist which argue capitalism is
detrimental to human

"<a   href="Ecocide.md" class="wikilink" title="the environment">"the

solve big issues like
"<a   href="poverty.md" class="wikilink" title="poverty">"poverty</a> or
"<a   href="hunger.md" class="wikilink" title="hunger">"hunger</a>. Others have
pointed out a link between capitalism and authoritarianism, noting the
methods to create capitalism involved stealing
"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="common land">"common land</a>
from "<a   href="Indigenous_People.md" class="wikilink"
title="indigenous">"indigenous</a> groups via

title="colonialism">"colonialism</a> and from medieval
"<a   href="peasants.md" class="wikilink" title="peasants">"peasants</a> via
"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">"enclosure</a>.
Additionally, capitalism has had a strong association with
"<a   href="fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="fascism">"fascism</a> and the
destruction of "<a   href="Social_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">"social democracy</a> in the third world.

### Economic Exploitation and Inequality

Capitalism creates systematic exploitation through the appropriation of
"<a   href="Surplus_Value.md" class="wikilink" title="surplus value">"surplus
value</a> from workers. Under capitalism, workers do not own the means
of production and must sell their labor power to survive. The
capitalist, who owns the capital (factories, land, machinery), pays
workers less than the value they produce, keeping the difference as
profit. This fundamental relationship creates a class divide where
wealth concentrates in the hands of a few while the many work to enrich
them.

As Adam Smith observed, "For one very rich man there must be at least
five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence
of the many." He recognized that civil government under capitalism "is
in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or
of those who have some property against those who have none at all."

The tendency of capitalism is to drive wages down to subsistence levels.
In Smith's words, in a fully capitalist country "the competition for
employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of
labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of
labourers." This prediction has proven grimly accurate in many parts of
the world.

### Violence and Death

Capitalism has been responsible for more deaths than any other economic
system. The system's origins required massive violence: the
transatlantic slave trade killed millions of Africans; the enclosures
displaced and impoverished countless peasants; colonial conquests
slaughtered indigenous populations worldwide. This violence was not
incidental but essential to creating the conditions capitalism
required—a desperate, landless workforce and access to resources for
exploitation.

Capitalism continues to kill through structural violence: workers dying
in unsafe conditions, people denied access to healthcare or food due to
inability to pay, communities poisoned by pollution from profit-seeking
corporations, wars fought over resources and markets. The profit motive
creates incentives to externalize costs onto the most vulnerable
populations.

### Environmental Destruction

Capitalism treats nature as a resource to be exploited for profit rather
than as a "<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">"commons</a>
to be stewarded. The drive for endless growth and profit maximization
leads inevitably to "<a   href="Ecocide.md" class="wikilink"
title="environmental destruction">"environmental destruction</a>.
Corporations pollute air and water, destroy forests and ecosystems, and
drive species to extinction because preventing these harms would reduce
profits.

The capitalist system's need for perpetual growth is fundamentally
incompatible with the finite resources of the planet.
"<a   href="Climate_Change.md" class="wikilink" title="Climate change">"Climate
change</a>, driven primarily by fossil fuel capitalism, represents an
existential threat to human civilization, yet the system proves
incapable of addressing it because doing so would require sacrificing
short-term profits.

### Alienation and Mental Health

Under capitalism, workers are alienated from the products of their
labor, from the labor process itself, from their fellow workers, and
from their own human nature. People spend their lives working to enrich
others, producing commodities they cannot afford, in jobs that feel
meaningless. This alienation contributes significantly to epidemics of
"<a   href="Mental_Health.md" class="wikilink"
title="depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems">"depression,
anxiety, and other mental health problems</a>.

The competitive, individualistic ethos of capitalism isolates people
from each other, replacing community solidarity with market relations.
Everything becomes commodified, including human relationships and care
work. The constant pressure to work longer hours, increase productivity,
and compete with others for survival creates chronic stress and burnout.

### Inefficiency and Waste

Despite claims of efficiency, capitalism produces massive waste. The
profit motive leads to "<a   href="Planned_Obsolescence.md" class="wikilink"
title="planned obsolescence">"planned obsolescence</a>, where products
are deliberately designed to fail so consumers must buy replacements.
Enormous resources go into advertising—convincing people to buy things
they don't need.
"<a   href="Food_Waste.md" class="wikilink" title="Food is destroyed">"Food is
destroyed</a> rather than given to hungry people because doing so would
not be profitable.

Capitalism cannot effectively address poverty or hunger not because
resources are scarce, but because solving these problems is not
profitable. Empty homes outnumber homeless people, food gets thrown away
while people starve, life-saving medicines are priced out of reach—all
because the system prioritizes profit over human needs.

### Authoritarianism and Fascism

Capitalism has consistently aligned with authoritarian regimes when
democratic movements threaten capitalist interests. Wealthy capitalists
funded the rise of fascism in Italy, Germany, and Spain when faced with
socialist movements. In the post-World War II era, capitalist powers
overthrew democratic governments throughout the Global South, installing
dictatorships to protect corporate interests and prevent
"<a   href="Socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialist">"socialist</a>
reforms.

The workplace itself functions as a dictatorship under capitalism.
Workers have no democratic control over their labor conditions, what
they produce, or how profits are distributed. Orders flow from the top
down, and workers must obey or face unemployment. This authoritarian
structure contradicts any claim that capitalism promotes freedom or
democracy.

### Moral Corruption

Capitalism corrupts moral sentiments by encouraging admiration of the
wealthy and contempt for the poor, regardless of how that wealth was
acquired or that poverty created. As Adam Smith observed, "This
disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful,
and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean
condition, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of
the corruption of our moral sentiments."

The system rewards selfish behavior and punishes altruism. Corporations
that pollute, exploit workers, or deceive customers often profit more
than those that behave ethically. This creates a race to the bottom
where moral considerations become obstacles to profit maximization.

### Historical Alternatives

Contrary to capitalist propaganda, capitalism is neither natural nor
inevitable. Throughout history, humans have organized economic life in
many different ways.
"<a   href="Gift_Economy.md" class="wikilink" title="Gift economies">"Gift
economies</a>, "<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="commons-based systems">"commons-based systems</a>, and various
forms of
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
have functioned successfully in different societies. Even today, much
essential work—childcare, community organizing, friendship,
love—operates outside capitalist exchange.

The fact that capitalism had to be violently imposed through enclosures,
colonialism, and slavery demonstrates that it was not a natural
evolution but a deliberate project that required destroying existing
forms of social organization. Understanding this history reveals that
alternatives are possible and that a
"<a   href="Post-Capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="post-capitalist">"post-capitalist</a> future based on cooperation,
mutual aid, and democratic control of production is achievable.
