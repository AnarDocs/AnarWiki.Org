Prince Shakur is a radical writer, organizer, educator, and multimedia
artist whose work explores Black liberation through intersecting lenses
of queerness, diasporic identity, and anti-colonial thought. His
practice spans journalism, literature, film, and digital media, with a
focus on uplifting Black histories, challenging systemic oppression, and
reimagining liberatory futures.

## Career

Shakur’s writing has been featured in publications such as Teen Vogue,
AfroPunk, The Cut, and others. His journalism and essays frequently
explore the personal and systemic impacts of incarceration, state
violence, and Black political struggle, with a strong commitment to
prison abolition and anti-capitalist frameworks. Through his work,
Shakur interrogates the cultural glorification of Black icons while
uncovering the violence and erasure often present in their lives and
legacies.

Shakur is also active on YouTube, where he operates two channels. His
travel and documentary series, Two Woke Minds, encourages decolonial
curiosity through global travel and storytelling. On his second channel,
he discusses his experiences as a debut author, challenges stereotypes
about Black writers and travelers, and offers political commentary from
a Black anarchist perspective.

As an organizer, Shakur has been involved in a wide range of movements.
While a student at Ohio University, he brought attention to racial
justice issues through organizing and writing. He later worked in
Seattle as a boycott organizer defending worker rights, and at Compass
Housing Alliance supporting unhoused communities. Shakur has
participated in environmental movements, including Standing Rock, and
has organized abolitionist trainings, protests, and cultural events as
part of the Black Queer and Intersectional Collective (BQIC). He has
also raised funds for migrant justice efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border
and contributed to anti-fascist organizing through art and political
action.

## Writing and Memoir

Shakur’s debut memoir, When They Tell You To Be Good (Tin House, 2022),
is a non-linear exploration of his life as a queer Jamaican-American
navigating personal grief, diasporic masculinity, and radicalization.
The memoir traces his political awakening from a closeted youth to a
globe-traveling anarchist writer, exploring the enduring impact of his
father’s murder, his family's immigration, and the intergenerational
scars of colonialism and patriarchy. The book blends elements of
afro-surrealism, queer resilience, and diasporic longing, offering a
radical reimagining of coming-of-age in an anti-Black world.

The memoir has been noted for its genre-defying approach and raw
vulnerability, crossing the boundaries of traditional narrative to
grapple with themes of identity, escapism, and survival. Through travels
across the Philippines, France, South Korea, and other locations, Shakur
interrogates both internal and external landscapes, situating personal
narrative within broader political struggles.

## Teaching and Residencies

Shakur’s writing has been recognized by the Society for Features
Journalism and the Hurston/Wright Foundation. He has held artist
residencies with Sangam House, Twelve Arts, Pages Program, The Studios
of Key West, Norton Island, Atlantic Center for the Arts, and La Maison
Baldwin. He has served as an English professor at Lehman College and has
facilitated workshops through the Lambda Literary LGBTQ Writers in
Schools program, where his teaching is rooted in radical approaches to
craft and political analysis.

He has also written, co-produced, and directed a forthcoming short film
centered on two childhood friends confronting a pivotal life event. His
multimedia practice continues to bridge literature, film, education, and
organizing.

## Other Projects

Shakur is the founder of the Millennial Writer Life newsletter, an
"Authortuber" sharing insights about publishing and writing, and host of
The Creative Hour Podcast, where he engages with other writers and
artists on creative process, politics, and craft. He is also the co-host
of the Black anarchist podcast, The Dugout.
