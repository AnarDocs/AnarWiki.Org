**Tankie Wiki time, grab a drink.**

A collection of kind of ragefans of the
"<a href="Tankie" class="wikilink" title="tankie">tankie</a>" subculture
documenting some of their greatest hits. Also arguably, tankie culture
is a bit of a fandom itself, and tends to attempt to ingratiate itself
in all other media based sub-cultures, and as such is worthy for
documentation here on Fandom, in order to help users be aware of this
phenomenon.

## What are “Tankies?”

Originally “tankie” was coined as a way to describe members of the
Communist Party of Great Britain who supported crushing the Hungarian
uprising in the 1950s and followed the Moscow line. This event caused a
split amongst communist parties. Support for this action destroyed the
credibility of the CPGB amongst other Marxists.

Modern use of the term “tankie” varies widely but tends to refer to
those who white-wash or fully deny the crimes of both historical
authoritarian-communist regimes, current tenuously-socialist regimes,
and, in the name of anti-imperialism, sometimes literally any state at
least nominally opposed to the US and its allies. Usage also includes
right-wing regimes appropriating communist histories. More on the
history and modern use of the term can be found here.

Maybe a better question is "why are tankies?".

**Note:** Reading Lenin or being a Marxist-Leninist does not make
someone a “tankie”. Some of the resources provided are from
Marxist-Leninists themselves who are against “tankieism”. Additionally,
the existence of “tankies” is not an excuse to be racist. Similarly,
there is a large diversity of Marxist thought especially amongst BIPoC
authors and activists.

## About Us

*This document is maintained by a small but diverse network of marxists,
anarchists, progressives, and other aligned leftists. Everyone tends to
work on their own little section independently or follows their own
interests. Wherever possible native speakers have also included links in
original languages or worked on sections relevant to their own
backgrounds.*

*We also include a range of different perspectives, wherever possible
including state documents or the perspectives of communists and leftists
from affected areas, so as to decentralize US-centric tankieism in left
discourses. This goal is especially important around more pressing
topics, such as genocide revisionism and the mass repression of complex
social movements. We also hope to help update conversations around
certain key events into the current moment.*

*We trust the reader to employ critical thinking about the biases of any
piece in this document and instead seek to form an understanding beyond
the many different angles presented here. As much as possible, we
attempt to name the biases of different outlets as stated in the
accessibility description.*

*The larger communities with which much of this information was
developed are mostly not from the US, are heavily queer, and largely
non-white/western.*

**Accessibility**: Info about accessibility, eg. languages, subtitles,
translations, file sizes, file formats, audio / video lengths in square
brackets, \[ \]. Information why someone might not click on a link,
political / corporate biases, content notes or content warnings in
parentheses, ( ).

If a Sci-Hub URL or a LibGen URL does not work, please check their
social media feeds to see if they moved domains. We will fix the links
when notified.

Also note, we regularly back up the wiki and will just revert the
changes of any vandalism. Even if this got taken down, we'd just self
host which would, if anything, be a more secure option.

entries</small>*
