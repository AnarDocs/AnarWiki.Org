# Centralism

## Overview

Centralism is the theory and practice of concentrating decision-making
power and organisational authority in centralised bodies, typically
leadership committees or planning bureaus, with the power to issue
binding directives to lower levels of organisation. Within socialist
movements, centralism has been most associated with
"<a   href="democratic_centralism.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic centralism">"democratic centralism</a> - the
organisational principle adopted by Leninist parties - and central
economic planning as practiced in the Soviet Union and other state
socialist countries.

Advocates of centralism argue that concentrating authority is necessary
for effective coordination, rational planning, and revolutionary
defence. Critics, particularly anarchists, argue that centralism
fundamentally undermines socialist and communist aims by creating new
ruling classes, enabling corruption and bureaucratic degeneration, and
making movements more vulnerable to defeat.

## Theory of Centralism

### Democratic Centralism

The most influential form of centralism in revolutionary movements has
been democratic centralism. First used by the German socialist
Schweitzer in the General Association of German Workers (which
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a> and
"<a   href="Friedrich_Engels.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">"Friedrich Engels</a> actually criticized in
their September 1868 letters), the concept was later adopted by Russian
Social Democrats.[^1]

"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">"Vladimir Lenin</a>'s 1906 formulation defined it
as "freedom of discussion, unity of action." By 1917, the Sixth Party
Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolshevik)
codified democratic centralism to include that "all decisions of higher
bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all Party
members."[^2]

Lenin argued this structure was necessary for professional revolutionary
organization under conditions of illegality and authoritarian
repression. He advocated for:

- Paid professional revolutionaries removed from wage labor
- Rigorous division of labor with specialized functions
- Centralized decision-making to enable rapid, coordinated action
- Discipline requiring minorities to submit to majority decisions
- Binding authority of higher bodies over lower bodies[^3]

### Justifications for Centralism

Centralist theorists have offered several arguments for concentrated
authority:

**Revolutionary Defence:** Centralists argue that defeating
counter-revolution requires unified command. Marxist-Leninists claim
that "the only guarantee of defence against counterrevolution is the
centralised dictatorship of the proletariat."[^4]

**Rational Planning:** Central planning is portrayed as necessary for
organizing production according to social needs. Centralists argue that
without top-down coordination, economic activity would be chaotic and
inefficient.

**Vanguard Leadership:** Lenin and Kautsky argued workers would only
achieve "trade union consciousness" without guidance from revolutionary
intellectuals. They claimed a centralized party was needed to bring
socialist consciousness to the working class.[^5]

**Organizational Efficiency:** Centralists claim that concentrated
decision-making prevents the paralysis of endless debate and enables
swift, coherent action in response to changing conditions.

## Anarchist Critique of Centralism

### Centralism Creates New Ruling Classes

Anarchists argue that centralism inevitably concentrates power in the
hands of a few, creating a new ruling class rather than liberating
workers. As "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> predicted, centralized
revolutionary organization produces dictatorship over the proletariat
rather than of the proletariat.

The Russian Revolution proved this critique accurate. The Bolsheviks
centralized power into party structures, systematically dismantling
workers' democracy. From spring 1918 onwards - before the civil war
escalated - the Bolsheviks disbanded soviets with non-Bolshevik
majorities and crushed working-class opposition to party directives.[^6]

As "<a   href="Ngo_Van.md" class="wikilink" title="Ngo Van">"Ngo Van</a>, a
Vietnamese revolutionary who participated in Leninist parties,
concluded: "the so-called 'workers' parties' (Leninist parties in
particular) are embryonic forms of the state. Once in power, these
parties form the nucleus of a new ruling class and bring about nothing
more than a new system of exploitation."[^7]

### Professional Revolutionaries Become Bureaucrats

Lenin's concept of paid professional revolutionaries inevitably creates
a separate class with interests distinct from the working class they
claim to serve. This mirrors how union bureaucracies, though originating
from the working class, develop interests opposed to workers through
their position as professional mediators.

"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">"Max
Nettlau</a> warned in 1909 that centralized organizations develop "a
group of pure interests that sets itself up opposite everyone,"
functioning like trusts whether capitalist or worker-controlled.[^8]
Left ideologies provide no protection against this transformation - the
separation of paid officials from the struggles of ordinary workers
gives them distinct material interests and perspectives.[^9]

In practice, centralist organizations develop "pronounced hierarchy"
with power concentrated in executive committees or political bureaus. In
the New Communist Movement in the United States, "real power rested with
an even smaller subgroup" who "retained authority to choose which
individuals would be assigned to the most important organizational
posts."[^10]

### Centralism Enables Systematic Corruption

Centralized planning and command structures are inherently vulnerable to
corruption. The Soviet experience demonstrated how central planning
created systematic falsification and bribery rather than meeting human
needs.

Soviet factory managers faced impossible quotas set by distant
bureaucrats who had no understanding of actual conditions. To meet these
demands while avoiding punishment, managers engaged in:

- Bribing officials to accept lower production numbers
- Skimming workers' wages to purchase products from other factories
- Falsifying reports to create the appearance of meeting quotas
- Trading favors and goods rather than following official plans[^11]

As "<a   href="Romeo_Kokriatski.md" class="wikilink"
title="Romeo Kokriatski">"Romeo Kokriatski</a> describes, the entire
system functioned on the principle that "the trick is not to actually do
things – doing things is dangerous, risky, and could bring down the
secret police – but to seem like things are done."[^12]

This corruption was structural rather than incidental. Centralizing
decision-making separates those with power from those with knowledge of
actual conditions, while giving central authorities coercive power over
subordinates. This creates systematic incentives for deception and
manipulation.

The result was that "the values then delivered, were not the wholesome
socialist values of hard work, integrity, and honesty and generosity to
your fellow man, but lies, deceit, and corruption."[^13]

### Centralism Suppresses Critical Thinking

Centralized organizations systematically undermine the development of
capable, independent revolutionaries. Members become order-takers rather
than creative militants.

In democratic centralist groups studied across multiple tendencies:

- Members were assigned tasks by central bodies rather than developing
  their own initiatives
- Expressing disagreements to non-members was forbidden
- In some cases, discussing differences with comrades outside one's
  immediate unit was prohibited
- Central bodies controlled information, filtering what members learned
  about political developments[^14]

One participant described democratic centralism in cultural work:
"Here's the line, write a song with the line. Period. You don't write
anything else that's not the line."[^15]

Rather than developing independent analysis, members learned to ask
leadership "what 'we' think" about major developments, accepting
whatever position would be revealed. This cultivation of subservience
makes movements vulnerable - without independent assessment
capabilities, revolutionaries cannot respond effectively to changing
conditions or resist manipulation.[^16]

### Centralism Weakens Revolutionary Defence

Contrary to centralist claims, concentrated authority weakens rather
than strengthens revolutionary movements. Centralism makes movements
more vulnerable to:

**Decapitation:** Concentrating leadership in central committees creates
single points of failure. Repression can destroy movements by targeting
leadership, whereas decentralized movements can continue despite losses.

**Alienation from Mass Base:** Centralized decision-making separates
leadership from the workers and communities they claim to represent.
This alienation undermines the popular support necessary for sustained
resistance.

**Internal Opposition:** By suppressing internal democracy and critical
thinking, centralism creates internal tensions and factional struggles
that weaken movements.

The
"<a   href="Makhnovist.md" class="wikilink" title="Makhnovist">"Makhnovist</a>
movement demonstrated that decentralized organization could effectively
defend revolution. Operating under conditions as difficult as the
Bolsheviks faced, the Makhnovists maintained soviet democracy and
freedom of organization while successfully defeating White
counter-revolutionary forces.[^17]

## Why Decentralization is Superior

### Decentralization Prevents Bureaucratic Degeneration

Decentralized organization prevents the emergence of permanent
leadership with independent interests.
"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">"Max
Nettlau</a> argued that centralized bodies inevitably function like
states: "such an organism has never gone away on its own: it is there,
it remains and it tends to extend itself; the State has done it and the
syndicate will do it."[^18]

He compared centralized revolutionary organizations to revolutionary
armies - both may be necessary for defense, but both tend to act for
themselves rather than the revolution they claim to serve. Just as
Napoleon's armies strangled the French Revolution, centralized workers'
organizations strangle social revolution through bureaucratic
takeover.[^19]

Decentralization prevents this by ensuring power remains distributed in
the hands of workers themselves rather than concentrated in permanent
bodies that develop independent interests.

### Decentralization Enables Effective Coordination

Anarchists do not oppose coordination or large-scale organization, but
reject centralized command structures. As
"<a   href="Luigi_Fabbri.md" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Fabbri">"Luigi
Fabbri</a> explained, anarchists oppose "the marxists' utopian idea of
production organized in a centralized way" while supporting broad
national and international organizations coordinated through
federation.[^20]

The key is distinguishing coordination from command:

**Coordination** means autonomous units voluntarily working together,
adjusting their activities through mutual agreement. Participants retain
decision-making power.

**Centralization** means higher bodies issuing binding directives that
lower bodies must follow. Participants are subordinated to central
authority.

Federalist coordination operates through mandated, recallable delegates
who coordinate activities without possessing independent authority.
Workers' councils, neighborhood assemblies, and workplace committees
make decisions for their own spheres, sending delegates to coordinate
wider issues while retaining ultimate control.[^21]

### Decentralization Develops Revolutionary Capacity

Decentralized organization develops the capacities of all participants
rather than concentrating expertise in professional leadership. This is
essential for revolution, which requires the active participation and
initiative of masses of people.

As
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> argued from 1890 onwards, large-scale modern production is
"interwoven and mutually dependent," requiring coordination. But this
coordination can be achieved through workers directly managing their own
affairs rather than submitting to central planning.[^22]

"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">"Max
Nettlau</a> emphasized that effective organization requires "full
liberty, the liberty of trial and experiment, as it exists in science;
which means that it is possible only in anarchy."[^23] Decentralized
experimentation allows appropriate organizational forms to emerge
through practice rather than being imposed from above.

### Decentralization Finds Appropriate Scale

Different activities function best at different scales. Some work best
locally, others require broader coordination. Centralized planning
cannot determine optimal proportions because planners are separated from
actual conditions and develop interests in maintaining their authority.

"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">"Max
Nettlau</a> argued the crucial issue is finding appropriate proportions
for each organizational function. These proportions must emerge through
voluntary experimentation: "For every organism there must be a certain
minimum of proportion in order for it to be viable, and beyond that, it
is possible, a higher degree of proportion in order for that organism to
be at least as durable, progressive."[^24]

Decentralized organization allows this discovery process, with different
units trying different approaches and learning from each other's
experiences.

## Decentralizing Centralized Groups

### Recognizing the Need for Change

Centralized groups face recurring problems that indicate the need for
transformation:

- Leadership becomes unaccountable or develops interests opposed to the
  base
- Members feel unable to take initiative or think critically
- Internal suppression of dissent creates factional conflicts
- The organization becomes isolated from the movements it claims to
  represent
- Decisions made by leadership fail because they ignore local conditions

Recognizing these patterns as structural rather than personal failures
is the first step toward decentralization.

### Distributing Decision-Making Power

The core of decentralization is shifting decision-making power from
central bodies to those directly affected by decisions:

**Workplace Decisions:** Those who do the work decide how to organize
it, rather than receiving directives from managers or committees.

**Local Issues:** Communities directly affected by issues make decisions
about them, rather than central bodies imposing solutions.

**Strategic Questions:** Coordination occurs through assemblies or
congresses of mandated delegates who can be instantly recalled, rather
than permanent leadership with independent authority.

This requires transforming the role of former leadership from
decision-makers to facilitators who support the decision-making of
others.

### Establishing Accountability Mechanisms

Decentralization requires robust accountability:

**Mandated Delegates:** Representatives receive specific mandates from
their base and can only negotiate within those mandates. They report
back before finalizing agreements.

**Instant Recall:** Delegates can be recalled at any time if they exceed
their mandate or lose the confidence of those they represent.

**Rotation:** Positions rotate regularly to prevent the development of
permanent leadership with specialized knowledge others lack.

**Transparency:** Decision-making processes and information are
accessible to all members, preventing the monopolization of knowledge by
leadership.

### Developing Member Capacities

Centralized groups concentrate skills and knowledge in leadership.
Decentralization requires spreading these capacities:

**Political Education:** All members engage in theoretical study and
analysis, not just designated intellectuals or leadership.

**Skill Sharing:** Those with specialized skills actively teach others
rather than monopolizing functions.

**Initiative Taking:** Members are encouraged to develop and implement
proposals rather than waiting for leadership direction.

**Critical Discussion:** Open debate and disagreement are encouraged as
necessary for developing strong analysis, rather than suppressed as
threats to unity.

### Building Horizontal Coordination

Replacing vertical command structures requires developing horizontal
coordination methods:

**Federation:** Autonomous units coordinate through voluntary agreements
rather than subordination to higher bodies.

**Working Groups:** Task-specific groups form and dissolve as needed,
with membership based on interest and commitment rather than appointment
by leadership.

**Information Sharing:** Regular communication between units allows
learning from each other's experiences without requiring central
approval.

**Mutual Aid:** Units support each other based on solidarity and shared
purpose rather than hierarchical obligation.

### Practical Challenges

Groups attempting to decentralize face several challenges:

**Existing Power Relations:** Former leaders may resist losing
authority. This requires political struggle, not just structural
changes.

**Skill Disparities:** Unequal development of members' capacities can
recreate informal hierarchies. Intentional capacity-building must
address this.

**Coordination Complexity:** Horizontal coordination requires more
active participation than following directives. This is a feature, not a
bug - it develops members' capabilities.

**External Pressure:** Centralized opponents may exploit the transition
period. However, decentralized organization ultimately proves more
resilient.

## Historical Examples

### Makhnovist Ukraine

The
"<a   href="Makhnovist.md" class="wikilink" title="Makhnovist">"Makhnovist</a>
movement demonstrated decentralized revolutionary organization during
the Russian Civil War. Operating in conditions as difficult as the
Bolsheviks faced, the Makhnovists maintained soviet democracy and
workers' self-management while successfully defending their territory.

When liberating towns, Makhnovists called meetings of workers and asked
them to organize management of industry "by their own means and under
their own control." They called Regional Congresses to discuss problems
facing the revolution, maintaining that "it is an inviolable right of
the workers and peasants, a right won by the revolution, to call
congresses on their own account, to discuss their affairs."[^25]

While Makhno occasionally made arbitrary decisions under battle
pressures, these violations were exceptional and contested, not elevated
to ideological doctrine as Bolshevik party dictatorship was. The
Regional Congresses held the army accountable for such decisions.

### Revolutionary Spain

In "<a   href="Revolutionary_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Spain">"Revolutionary Spain</a>, anarchists
implemented decentralized coordination across regions. Workers and
peasants directly managed collectivized industries and agriculture
through assemblies and federations rather than central planning bureaus.

This decentralized organization proved effective at organizing
production and defense until crushed by the combined forces of fascism
and Stalinism - the latter imposing centralized control that undermined
revolutionary defense in the name of "anti-fascist unity."

### Bolshevik Suppression of Alternatives

The Bolshevik response to decentralized alternatives demonstrates
centralism's authoritarian logic. The Workers' Opposition and Democratic
Centralist factions within the Bolshevik Party argued for workers'
self-management of the economy through unions and soviets rather than
party dictatorship. Lenin crushed these factions, implementing the ban
on party factions that became a tool for totalitarian control.[^26]

Externally, the Bolsheviks destroyed the Makhnovist movement despite its
crucial role in defeating the White armies. They also violently
suppressed the Kronstadt sailors - once the vanguard of the revolution -
when they demanded soviet democracy and workers' control.[^27]

These actions revealed that centralism requires suppressing
working-class democracy to maintain concentrated authority.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Centralism in Low-Level Struggle

In periods of low social movement activity, centralist organization
proves particularly harmful. When the left is isolated from mass
struggle, centralizing leadership means "centralizing deformed
leadership and making concrete the left's alienation from
struggle."[^28]

Democratic centralism in contemporary conditions intensifies the worst
dynamics of isolated political sects, creating bureaucratic structures
divorced from actual working-class organizing.

### False Compromises

Some propose "balancing" centralization and decentralization, or
distinguishing democratic centralism from bureaucratic centralism. These
efforts fail because they preserve the fundamental problem: directive
power concentrated in bodies above the base of organization.

As one critic argues: "centralist social structures are basically
incompatible with any kind of egalitarian socialism."[^29] The issue is
not finding the right amount of centralism but eliminating hierarchical
power concentration entirely.
