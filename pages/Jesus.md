# Jesus As Anarchist

The concept of **Jesus As Anarchist** is a theological and political
interpretation that views Jesus Christ as advocating for
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
principles, including the rejection of
<a href="hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical authority">hierarchical authority</a>, opposition to
state power, and the promotion of voluntary cooperation and
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.
This perspective has been argued by various thinkers, theologians, and
political philosophers from the 19th century to the present day.

## Historical Development

The interpretation of Jesus as an anarchist figure emerged prominently
in the 19th and early 20th centuries, gaining traction among Christian
anarchists and radical theologians. Early proponents included Leo
Tolstoy, who argued that Christianity in its true sense "puts an end to
the State" and that Christ was crucified for this very reason.[^1]

## Biblical Foundations

### Challenge to Political Authority

Proponents of this interpretation point to several biblical passages as
evidence of Jesus's anarchist tendencies. In Matthew 22:21, Jesus states
"Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's," which
some interpret as avoiding endorsement of state authority rather than
supporting it. Similarly, in John 18:36, Jesus declares "My kingdom is
not of this world," suggesting a rejection of earthly political systems.

### Rejection of Religious Hierarchy

Jesus's teachings frequently challenged established religious authority.
In Matthew 23:8-12, he instructs his followers: "But you are not to be
called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers...
whoever exalts himself will be humbled." This passage is interpreted as
advocating for egalitarian relationships rather than hierarchical
structures.

### Economic Justice and Mutual Aid

The early Christian community described in Acts 2:44-47 practiced
communal ownership, with believers holding "all things in common" and
distributing resources according to need. Jesus's direct teachings on
wealth, including his instruction in Matthew 19:21 to "Sell what you
possess and give to the poor," are seen as fundamentally
anti-capitalist.

### Civil Disobedience

Jesus's actions in the temple, overturning the tables of money changers
(Matthew 21:12-13), and his pattern of healing on the Sabbath despite
religious prohibitions, demonstrate what anarchist interpreters see as
principled civil disobedience against unjust authority.

## Anti-Capitalist Interpretation

### Condemnation of Wealth

Several passages are cited as evidence of Jesus's opposition to
capitalist accumulation of wealth. In Matthew 6:24, Jesus states "No one
can serve two masters... You cannot serve both God and mammon (money)."
The famous passage in Matthew 19:24 declares it "easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the
kingdom of God."

### Economic Justice Teachings

The parable of the sheep and goats in Matthew 25:31-46 emphasizes care
for "the least of these," while Luke 4:18 describes Jesus's mission as
bringing "good news to the poor." These teachings are interpreted as
advocating for economic justice and redistribution of wealth.

## Notable Advocates

### 19th and Early 20th Century

Several prominent figures have explicitly identified Jesus as an
anarchist:

- <a href="Leo_Tolstoy" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
  Tolstoy</a> argued that Christianity fundamentally opposes state
  authority, writing that "Christianity in its true sense puts an end to
  the State."[^2]

<!-- -->

- <a href="Elbert_Hubbard" class="wikilink" title="Elbert Hubbard">Elbert
  Hubbard</a> declared: "I AM an Anarchist. All good men are Anarchists.
  All cultured, kindly men; all gentlemen; all just men are Anarchists.
  Jesus was an anarchist."[^3]

<!-- -->

- Ernest Renan described Jesus as having "no idea of civil government"
  and dreaming of "a great social revolution, in which rank will be
  overturned."[^4]

### Modern Interpretations

- <a href="Ivan_Illich" class="wikilink" title="Ivan Illich">Ivan
  Illich</a> stated that "Jesus was an anarchist savior. That's what the
  Gospels tell us."[^5]

<!-- -->

- <a href="Dave_Andrews" class="wikilink" title="Dave Andrews">Dave
  Andrews</a> characterized Jesus as "the supreme example of authentic
  anarchy — the creative non-violent anarchist par excellence."[^6]

## Theological Arguments

### Non-Violence and Resistance

Anarchist interpretations emphasize Jesus's teaching of non-violent
resistance. The instruction to "turn the other cheek" and "resist not
evil" (Matthew 5:39) is seen not as passive submission but as active
non-violent resistance to oppression.

### Rejection of Temporal Power

The temptation narrative, where Jesus rejects Satan's offer of worldly
kingdoms, is interpreted as a fundamental rejection of political power
and authority. As Upton Sinclair noted, Jesus "would have nothing to do
with worldly glory, with 'temporal power;' he chose the career of a
revolutionary agitator."[^7]

### Contrast with Pauline Teachings

Some proponents of Jesus as anarchist note a tension between Jesus's
teachings and those of Paul, particularly Romans 13:1, which states "Let
every person be subject to the governing authorities." This contrast is
used to argue that later Christian theology departed from Jesus's
original anarchist message.

## Legacy and Influence

The interpretation of Jesus as anarchist has influenced various
movements, including <a href="Christian_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a>, liberation
theology, and certain strands of the Social Gospel movement. It
continues to be discussed in contemporary theological and political
discourse, particularly among those seeking to reconcile religious faith
with anti-authoritarian political positions.
