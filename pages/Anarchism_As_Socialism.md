# Anarchism As Socialism

Since the 1840s, anarchists have consistently identified themselves as
socialists, positioning anarchism as a branch of the socialist
movement - specifically its stateless, libertarian, and
anti-authoritarian wing. This understanding has been held by virtually
all major anarchist thinkers, from
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> to
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> and "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a>, though it has sometimes
been obscured by modern misunderstandings of the term "socialism."

## Overview

Anarchism has historically been understood as a branch of the broader
socialist movement. As "<a   href="Michael_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Michael Bakunin">"Michael Bakunin</a> described it, anarchism is
"stateless socialism."[^1]
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> wrote in his 1910 entry on "Anarchism" for the
Encyclopedia Britannica that "the anarchists, in common with all
socialists, of whom they constitute the left wing...consider the wage
system and capitalist production altogether as an obstacle to
progress."[^2]

The anarchist-socialist position holds that a truly socialist economy -
characterized by collective ownership of the means of production,
cooperation rather than competition, production for use rather than
profit, and a classless society - can only be achieved without a state.
Anarchists have consistently argued that state socialism, regardless of
the subjective intentions of its advocates, would in practice create
only a form of "<a   href="state_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">"state capitalism</a> with the bureaucracy
acting as a new exploitative ruling class.

As "<a   href="Daniel_Guérin.md" class="wikilink" title="Daniel Guérin">"Daniel
Guérin</a> explained, "Anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The
anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the
exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of
socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for
liberty and haste to abolish the State."[^3]

## Origins

The identification of anarchism with socialism dates to the earliest
anarchist theorists. "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, the first
person to identify himself as an "anarchist," usually described himself
as a socialist. He argued against centralized democracy and
"<a   href="state_socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="state socialism">"state
socialism</a>, calling instead for a decentralized, self-managed,
federal, bottom-up socialism.[^4]

"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> and other early anarchists
developed this tradition further, making explicit that anarchism
represented the libertarian wing of the socialist movement. The great
Italian anarchist "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> wrote in 1897: "From 1871,
when we began our propaganda in Italy, we have always been and have
always called ourselves, socialist-anarchists....We have always been of
the opinion that socialism and anarchy are two words which basically
have the same meaning, since it is impossible to have economic
emancipation (abolition of property) without political emancipation
(abolition of government) and vice versa."[^5]

The "<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">"individualist anarchist</a> tradition in
America also maintained this socialist identification.
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a> wrote in 1893 of "the two
principles...Authority and Liberty" as the basis of "the two schools of
Socialistic thought...respectively, State Socialism and Anarchism."[^6]
In his 1884 essay "Socialism: What It Is," Tucker defended the term
socialism as expressing "the purpose of political and economic progress,
the aim of the Revolution in this century, the recognition of the great
truth that Liberty and Equality, through the law of Solidarity, will
cause the welfare of each to contribute to the welfare of all."[^7]

American anarchist
"<a   href="Adolph_Fischer.md" class="wikilink" title="Adolph Fischer">"Adolph
Fischer</a>, one of the Haymarket Martyrs, articulated the relationship
clearly: "Every anarchist is a socialist, but not every socialist is
necessarily an anarchist."[^8]

## Economic Program

The anarchist economic program has always been fundamentally socialist
in character. Anarchists advocate:

- Taking away the wealth and power of the capitalist elite
- Replacing private ownership of the means of production with
  collectivized, social ownership
- Replacing economic competition with cooperation
- Replacing production for profit with production for use
- Replacing class divisions with a classless society
- Democratic coordination and planning from below

As "<a   href="Gustav_Landauer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gustav Landauer">"Gustav Landauer</a> explained, "Socialism is the
means by which we want to reach and secure...freedom: solidarity,
sharing, and cooperative labor."[^9]

"<a   href="Lorenzo_Kom&#39;boa_Ervin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lorenzo Kom&#39;boa Ervin">"Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin</a> summarized:
"Anarchists are opposed to government, the state and Capitalism.
Therefore, simply speaking, Anarchism is a no-government form of
Socialism. In common with all Socialists, the Anarchists hold that the
private ownership of land, capital and machinery has had its time; that
it is condemned to disappear, and that all requisites for production
must and will, become the common property of society, and be managed in
common by the producers of wealth."[^10]

## Distinguishing From State Socialism

A critical aspect of anarchist socialism is its opposition to
"<a   href="state_socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="state socialism">"state
socialism</a>. Classical anarchists did not condemn "socialism" in
general, but specifically "state socialism" or "authoritarian
socialism." They regarded themselves as being far to the left of the
authoritarian Left.

Kropotkin wrote that to "hand over to the state all the main sources of
economical life...would mean to create a new instrument of tyranny.
State capitalism would only increase the powers of bureaucracy and
capitalism."[^11]

This distinction remains vital for contemporary anarchists. As Wayne
Price argues, revolutionary anarchist-socialists must "oppose all
varieties of state socialism, both reformist (working through the
existing state) and 'revolutionary' (seeking to overturn this state and
to set up a new state—the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' or
whatever)."[^12]

## Contemporary Relevance

The identification of anarchism as socialism remains important for
several reasons:

**Distinguishing from Right-Wing "Libertarianism"**: The growth of
capitalist "libertarianism" makes it necessary for anarchists to
identify as "libertarian socialists" to distinguish themselves from
supporters of capitalism and exploitation.[^13]

**Responding to Democratic Socialism**: The recent growth of interest in
"democratic socialism" presents both opportunities and challenges. While
anarchists should welcome popular hostility to capitalism, they must
also distinguish their revolutionary anti-state position from reformist
state socialism.[^14]

As
"<a   href="Cindy_Milstein.md" class="wikilink" title="Cindy Milstein">"Cindy
Milstein</a> notes, "Anarchism appears to be the only form of
libertarian socialism that speaks to the times and people's
dreams."[^15]

"<a   href="Donald_Rooum.md" class="wikilink" title="Donald Rooum">"Donald
Rooum</a> explains: "Anarchists are extreme libertarian socialists,
'libertarian' meaning the demand for freedom from prohibition, and
'socialist' meaning the demand for social equality....Complete freedom
implies equality, since if there are rich and poor, the poor cannot be
permitted to take liberties with riches. Complete equality implies
freedom, since those who suffer restrictions cannot be the equals of
those who impose them."[^16]

## Criticism

Some anarchists have rejected the socialist label, particularly in
response to the authoritarian character of historical state socialist
regimes. However, classical anarchists like Malatesta addressed this by
maintaining their anarchist-socialist identity while refusing to use the
term "communist" after it became associated with
"<a   href="Leninism.md" class="wikilink" title="Leninism">"Leninism</a>.[^17]

Other critics argue that the term "socialism" has become too associated
with statism to be useful. However, anarchists counter that the term
represents too important a tradition to abandon, and that by identifying
as "anarchist-socialists" or "libertarian socialists," they can both
claim their rightful place in the socialist tradition and distinguish
themselves from authoritarian variants.
