> The Royal Institute of British Architects sponsored a report on the
> methods of organisation in archi­tects' offices.[^1] The survey team
> felt able to distinguish two opposite approaches to the process of
> design, which gave rise to very different ways of working and methods
> of organisation.' One was characterised by a procedure which began by
> the invention of a building shape and was followed by a moulding of
> the client's needs to fit inside this three­ dimensional preconception.
> The other began with an attempt to under­ stand fully the needs of the
> people who were to use the building around which, when they were
> clarified, the building would be fitted.'
>
> For the first type, once the basic act of invention and imagination is
> over, the rest is easy and the architect makes decisions quickly,
> produces work to time and quickly enough to make a reasonable profit.
> 'The evidence suggests that this attitude is the predominant one in
> the group of offices which we found to be using a centralised type of
> work organi­sation, and it clearly goes with rather autocratic forms of
> control.' But 'the other philosophy - from user's needs to building
> form - makes decision making more difficult . . . The work takes
> longer and is often unprofitable to the architect, although the client
> may end up with a much cheaper building put up more quickly than he
> had expected. Many offices working in this way had found themselves
> better suited by a *dispersed* type of work organisation which can
> promote an informal atmosphere of free-flowing ideas . . .' The team
> found that (apart from a small 'hybrid' group of large public offices
> with a very rigid and hierar­chical structure, a poor quality of
> design, poor technical and managerial efficiency) the offices surveyed
> could be classed as either centralised or dispersed types. Staff
> turnover, which bore no relation at all to earnings, was high in the
> centralised offices and low or very low in the dispersed ones, where
> there was considerable delegation of responsibility to assis­tants, and
> where we found a lively working atmosphere'.
>
> This is a very live issue among architects and it was not a young
> revo­lutionary architect but Sir William Pile, when he was head of the
> Architects and Buildings Branch of the Ministry of Education, who
> specified among the things he looked for in a member of the building
> team that 'He must have a belief in what I call the non-hierarchical
> organisation of the work. The work has got to be organised not on the
> star system but on the repertory system. The team leader may often be
> junior to a team member. That will only be accepted if it is commonly
> accepted that primacy lies with the best idea and not with the senior
> man.' Again from the architectural world, Walter Gropius proclaimed
> what he called the technique of 'collaboration among men, which would
> release the creative instincts of the individual instead of smothering
> them. The essense of such technique should be to emphasise indi­vidual
> freedom of initiative, instead of authoritarian direction by a boss .
> . . synchronising individual effort by a continuous give and take of
> its members...[^2]
