# Zionism

**Zionism** or **Jewish Nationalism** is a political ideology which says
that "<a   href="Judaism.md" class="wikilink" title="Jewish people">Jewish
people</a> have a right to a nation in part of or all of the holy land
of "<a   href="Israel.md" class="wikilink" title="Israel">Israel</a>, which
Jews are indigenous to. Supporters argue that this is a necessity to
provide a safe areas for Jewish people to live and practice their
religion in peace and safety (note that Zionism became popular after the
"<a   href="Holocaust.md" class="wikilink" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>),
critics argue that it's a violent ideology used to justify a system of
apartheid and Palestinian oppression.

## Types of Zionism

### Arab Zionism

Zionism as supported by Arab nations. An example would be the Hashemites
during World War 1. They were promised to rule the Middle East by the
British, and they and the Zionists came to a deal where modern-day
Israel, the West Bank, Northern Syria, the Gaza Strip and Jordan would
become a Jewish state (roughly similar to the old one in scope), itself
inside a new Arab state to replace the Ottomans. The Hashemites
abandoned the idea and, with the support of the British, broke with the
Balfour Declaration and San Remo Conference which established modern
Jordan (then called Transjordan) as inside this, and founded the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.

### Christian Zionism

**Christian Zionism** is a belief among some Christians that the return
of Jews to the
"<a   href="Holy_Land.md" class="wikilink" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a> and
the establishment of Israel fulfills biblical prophecy. Christian
Zionists often support Israel based on theological interpretations of
scripture, particularly regarding the End Times. This movement has been
influential in American evangelical politics and has provided
significant political support for Israel, though it is sometimes
criticized by both Jews and other Christians for potentially
instrumentalizing Jewish people for Christian eschatological purposes.

### Cultural Zionism

**Cultural Zionism** or **Spiritual Zionism** emphasized the revival of
Jewish culture and Hebrew language rather than political statehood.
Pioneered by thinkers like
"<a   href="Ahad_Ha&#39;am.md" class="wikilink" title="Ahad Ha&#39;am">Ahad
Ha'am</a>, this movement argued that Palestine should become a spiritual
and cultural center for world Jewry, focusing on Jewish cultural
renaissance and the development of Hebrew literature and education.
Cultural Zionists were often critical of political Zionism's emphasis on
statehood, believing that Jewish spiritual and cultural renewal was more
important than political sovereignty.

### Green Zionism

**Green Zionism** is a synthesis of
"<a   href="Environmentalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="environmentalist">environmentalist</a> and Zionist politics,
arguing that Israel must be a clean and sustainable civilization. It has
been influential in several
"<a   href="Kibbutzim.md" class="wikilink" title="Kibbutzim">Kibbutzim</a>,
which have made efforts to reduce their impact on the environment.

### Kahanism

**Kahanism** is an ultranationalist and theocratic form of Zionism
founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane. Kahanism advocates for the expulsion of
all non-Jews from Israel and the occupied territories, the establishment
of a theocratic Jewish state based on
"<a   href="Halakha.md" class="wikilink" title="Halakha">Halakha</a> (Jewish
religious law), and the rejection of democracy in favor of Torah-based
governance. This ideology has been widely condemned as racist and
fascistic, and Kahane's political party was banned from the Israeli
Knesset. Several organizations inspired by Kahanist ideology have been
designated as terrorist groups.

### Labor Zionism

**Labor Zionism** or **Socialist Zionism** combines Zionist and
socialist politics. Some Labor Zionists argue that the creation of a
socialist society would correct the "inverted pyramid" of Jewish
society. Jews were forced out of normal occupations by Gentile hostility
and competition, using this dynamic to explain the relative predominance
of Jewish professionals, rather than workers. Jewish society, they
argued, would not be healthy until the inverted pyramid was righted, and
a substantial number of Jews became workers and peasants again. This,
they held, could only be accomplished by Jews in their own country.
Labor Zionism has been hugely influential in the creation of the
"<a   href="Kibbutzim.md" class="wikilink" title="Kibbutzim">Kibbutzim</a> and
"<a   href="Moshav.md" class="wikilink" title="Moshavim">Moshavim</a>.

### Anarcho-Zionism

A type of Zionism which supports the right of Jewish people to create
communes inside Israel, and establish them as an escape from
anti-semitism, and holds allowing this to happen is natural and should
be supported in a Anarchist Society. Anarcho-Zionism does not hold the
state as essential to Zionism, but rather the community.

### Muslim Zionism

**Muslim Zionism** refers to historical instances where some Muslims
supported Jewish settlement in Palestine, often for pragmatic or
theological reasons. Some Ottoman officials initially welcomed Jewish
immigration as a way to modernize Palestine, while certain Islamic
scholars argued that Jewish return to the Holy Land fulfilled Quranic
prophecy. However, this support largely disappeared as Zionism became
associated with displacement of Palestinian Arabs and European colonial
interests. Today, the term is primarily used historically rather than to
describe contemporary positions.

### Neo-Zionism

An idea, mainly purported by Anti-Zionists, of a new type of Zionism,
based on mass expansion. No group has ever called itself Neo-Zionist,
and the term was coined alongside Post-Zionism.

### Post-Zionism

**Post-Zionism** is a position that argues Israel has fulfilled its
functions, but it raises further questions about Israel's future, such
as:

- Is the state of Israel indeed a safe shelter for the Jewish nation?
- How does Israel keep its Jewish and Democratic character?
- Should all the blame for the continuation of the conflict fall on the
  Arab side?

Post-Zionists argue that Israel must serve a function as a democratic
and egalitarian state in a region of brutal authoritarianism and
inequality.

### Reform Zionism

**Reform Zionism** emerged from the
"<a   href="Reform_Judaism.md" class="wikilink" title="Reform Judaism">Reform
Judaism</a> movement and initially opposed traditional Zionism, arguing
that Judaism was a religion rather than a nationality and that Jews
should integrate into their host societies. However, following the
"<a   href="Holocaust.md" class="wikilink" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>,
most Reform Jews embraced a form of Zionism that supported Israel while
maintaining that Jews could have dual loyalties to both Israel and their
countries of residence. Reform Zionism typically emphasizes Israel's
democratic values, religious pluralism, and social justice, often taking
more liberal positions on issues like Palestinian rights and territorial
compromise.

### Religious Zionism

**Religious Zionism** or **National Religious** movement combines Jewish
religious observance with Zionist nationalism, viewing the establishment
of Israel as the beginning of divine redemption. Religious Zionists see
the return to the Land of Israel as a religious commandment and often
support settlement expansion in the
"<a   href="West_Bank.md" class="wikilink" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> as
fulfilling biblical promises. This movement has been influential in
Israeli politics through parties like the National Religious Party and
has produced many of the settlers in the occupied territories. Religious
Zionists often oppose territorial compromise, viewing the entire Land of
Israel as divinely promised to the Jewish people.

### Revisionist Zionism

A Zionist which supports Conservative (usually moderate
right-Libertarian) positions, as opposed to Labour Zionism, which was
the status quo at its inception. Revisionist Zionism currently accepts
and supports things like Universal Healthcare and Gay Rights in Israel,
but has advocated for economic deregulation and a more capitalist
structure overall.

## Criticism

Critics of Zionism are generally called **Anti-Zionists**, and
criticisms can divided into 'good' and 'bad' criticisms. Good criticisms
recognise that Jews and Zionists are different groups of people, and are
thus not critical of Jewish people or Jewish religion. Bad criticism
does not recognise that Jews and Zionists are different groups of
people, and is often used as a cover for antisemitism. Bad criticism
also fundamentally rejects Jews as a people, their history in Israel,
and their ethnic or cultural connection to Israel. Criticism such as
denying Zionism uniquely supporting other forms of statism like it falls
into this category.

We stand with all Jews of the world against antisemitism from the left
and right. Along with all other people against any form of bigotry.

### Good Criticism

Good criticism of Zionism focuses on policy and political positions
rather than attacking Jewish identity or denying historical Jewish
connection to the land. Such criticism might include opposition to
ethno-states, theocratic states and the existence of states at all. It
may include the conditions of
"<a   href="apartheid.md" class="wikilink" title="apartheid">apartheid</a>,
the treatment of Palestinians, and the genocidal actions of
\[\[Israel\]_upon_the_people_of_\[\[Gaza\|Israel\] upon the people of
"<a   href="Gaza.md" class="wikilink" title="Gaza">Gaza</a>. However, it
distinguishes between criticism of Israeli actions and antisemitism,
recognises the historical persecution of Jews (without this being a
justification for Israel's actions), but avoids conspiracy theories or
denial of Jewish history.

### Bad Criticism

Bad criticism of Zionism is it conflates the Jewish religion with
Zionism, as not all religious Jews accept or believe in the same form of
Zionism, and many do not believe in it at all. It is unacceptable to
speak of 'Jews' as a single monolithic group, and apply criticism to all
of them, based on the actions of the Israeli state, or even when many
(or even the majority) of Israeli's hold harmful views. There are Jewish
people, some of whom were born in that region, protesting and opposing
the actions of the Israeli state and such views.

## Zionism As A Form Of Racism

In 1975, the
"<a   href="United_Nations.md" class="wikilink" title="United Nations">United
Nations</a> General Assembly passed Resolution 3379, which declared
Zionism "a form of racism and racial discrimination." This resolution
was heavily promoted by the Soviet Union and Arab states during the Cold
War era. However, the resolution was revoked in 1991 by Resolution 4686,
with many arguing that the original resolution had conflated legitimate
criticism of Israeli policies with antisemitism.

Critics who view Zionism as racist point to discriminatory laws in
Israel that privilege Jewish citizens over non-Jewish citizens, the
displacement of Palestinians during Israel's establishment, and policies
in the occupied territories that create different legal systems for
Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents. They argue that ethnic
nationalism inherently creates hierarchies based on ethnicity.
