# Commodification

**Commodification** refers to the transformation of goods, services,
relationships, nature and social practices into commodities for sale
within market systems. Under capitalism, this process extends beyond
simple trade to create a totalizing system where profit extraction
becomes the organizing principle of society, displacing use-value with
exchange-value and subordinating human needs to market logic.

## Origins and Development

The roots of commodification extend deep into civilized history, long
predating modern capitalism. Early state formations in Mesopotamia, the
Indus Valley and elsewhere developed core-periphery dynamics where urban
centers extracted resources from hinterlands, creating specialization,
surplus accumulation and ecological degradation. These ancient systems
established patterns of resource control, social stratification and
environmental exploitation that would intensify through successive
civilizations.

The process accelerated dramatically with colonialism and the rise of
industrial capitalism. What distinguishes capitalist commodification
from earlier forms is its totalizing character and self-reinforcing
logic. Capitalism transforms not merely goods but the very capacity to
labor into a commodity, creating a class compelled to sell their
labor-power to survive while another class monopolizes the means of
production.

## The Mechanics of Commodification

### Enclosure and Alienation

Commodification begins with enclosure - the seizure of commons and
transformation of freely accessible resources into private property.
This historical process, from the English enclosures through colonial
land theft to contemporary privatization schemes, separates people from
direct access to resources necessary for life. Once enclosed, these
resources become available only through market exchange, forcing
populations into wage dependency.

The capitalist relationship rests on a fundamental asymmetry:
capitalists control enclosed resources and charge rents on their use,
extracting value from workers' labor. What workers receive as wages
represents only a fraction of the value they produce, with the remainder
captured as profit. This extracted surplus then finances further
accumulation and enclosure, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of
exploitation and growth.

### The Growth Imperative

Capitalism cannot exist in equilibrium. Competition between firms
creates pressure for continuous expansion - those who fail to grow face
elimination by those who do. Capital accumulation enables increased
production capacity, which in turn allows greater profit extraction,
which finances further accumulation. This growth imperative operates
independent of actual human needs, driven instead by the internal logic
of capital itself.

The consequences are catastrophic. Capitalism's requirement for endless
growth collides inevitably with ecological limits. Every expansion of
production accelerates resource extraction and waste generation beyond
sustainable thresholds. Climate breakdown, mass extinction,
deforestation, ocean acidification and countless other ecological crises
stem directly from commodification's growth imperative.

## Spheres of Commodification

### Nature and the Environment

The commodification of nature treats ecosystems as resource stockpiles
for extraction rather than living systems requiring respect and care.
Forests become timber inventories, rivers become water supplies, animals
become protein units. This reduction destroys ecological complexity
while enabling industrial-scale devastation.

Capitalism has commodified over 90% of large ocean fish populations,
cleared vast forest ecosystems, degraded topsoil globally, and driven
species extinction at rates unseen since the asteroid that killed the
dinosaurs. The logic is inexorable: nature has value only insofar as it
can be converted into profit.

Contemporary "green capitalism" extends commodification further through
carbon markets, ecosystem services valuation and nature-based financial
instruments. Rather than challenging the system destroying the
biosphere, these schemes attempt to save capitalism by pricing
ecological destruction, creating new profit opportunities from
environmental crisis itself.

### Labor and Life

Under capitalism, human labor-power becomes a commodity bought and sold
like any other. Workers must sell their capacity to work to survive,
submitting to authoritarian workplace hierarchies and alienating
conditions. The wage system severs the connection between labor and its
products - workers create but do not control what they make.

This commodification extends beyond formal employment into
"self-commodification." Social media influencers, gig workers and others
increasingly treat themselves as brands, marketing their personalities,
experiences and relationships for profit. The distinction between work
and life dissolves as existence itself becomes oriented toward market
value.

### Knowledge and Culture

Intellectual property regimes commodify knowledge, transforming shared
cultural heritage and collaborative creativity into privately owned
products. Traditional knowledge, indigenous cultural practices, even
genetic sequences become "intellectual property" subject to monopoly
control and profit extraction.

Mass culture industries commodify creativity and experience. Holidays
like Christmas become shopping seasons, authentic cultural practices
become tourist attractions, social movements get reduced to consumer
lifestyle choices. Everything must be monetized, packaged and sold.

### Care and Relationships

Capitalism increasingly commodifies care, relationships and intimacy.
Childcare, eldercare, emotional labor - activities once part of
community mutual aid - become services purchased in markets. Dating
becomes an industry, friendship networks get monetized through platform
capitalism, even death transforms into profit opportunities through
funeral industries.

This process atomizes communities and destroys reciprocal support
systems, replacing them with market transactions that reinforce
inequality and dependence on capital.

## Commodification and the State

The state and capitalism represent two faces of the same system of
domination. Both rest on accumulation and centralized power; both
require hierarchy, coercion and exploitation. The state arose not as a
response to capitalism but as its precursor and foundation, establishing
the conditions for market systems through enclosure, property law
enforcement and violence against resistance.

States maintain the legal frameworks enabling commodification - property
rights, contract enforcement, intellectual property regimes. They
suppress alternatives through criminalization of commoning, persecution
of squatters, destruction of autonomous communities. State violence
backs every eviction, every foreclosure, every seizure of resources from
communities for corporate profit.

The interchangeability of state and capital becomes clear in state
socialist experiments, which maintained commodified wage labor,
productivism and growth imperatives despite changing ownership forms.
Whether under private or state control, commodification's fundamental
dynamics - accumulation, hierarchy, extraction - persist.

## The Impossibility of Reform

Attempts to humanize commodification through state intervention
consistently fail because they preserve the underlying system. Social
democratic reforms may redistribute some wealth but cannot halt
accumulation's logic or growth's ecological consequences. "Green growth"
and "sustainable capitalism" are contradictions - sustainability
requires degrowth and decommodification, which capitalism cannot
tolerate.

Proposed solutions like Universal Basic Income, while potentially
helpful as transitional measures, risk reinforcing rather than
challenging commodification if implemented within capitalist frameworks.
UBI could simply subsidize low wages for employers while maintaining the
wage system itself. Without attacking the roots of commodification -
enclosure, hierarchy, the commodity form itself - reforms merely manage
capitalism's crises without resolving them.

## Decommodification and the Anarchist Alternative

Decommodification means abolishing production for exchange-value and
market distribution, replacing them with production for direct use and
distribution according to need. This requires dismantling capitalism and
the state simultaneously, as both maintain commodification's dominance.

### From Commodity to Commons

Decommodification begins with recommoning - returning enclosed resources
to collective stewardship. Land, housing, water, energy infrastructure,
means of production - all must be freed from private or state control
and placed under community management. This is not state ownership
rebranded but genuine common ownership, with access determined by need
rather than ability to pay.

Recommoning requires expropriating the expropriators - taking back what
capitalism stole. Squatting movements, land occupations, resistance to
privatization and defence of remaining commons all represent practical
moves toward decommodification.

### Production for Use

Capitalist production serves profit maximization, creating massive waste
through planned obsolescence, overproduction, redundant competition and
manufacture of useless commodities. Decommodified production would
orient toward meeting actual needs sustainably.

This means:

- Democratic control of production by workers and communities rather
  than bosses or bureaucrats
- Planning based on needs assessment rather than profit potential
- Design for durability, repairability and ecological sustainability
- Reduction of unnecessary production and elimination of wasteful
  industries
- Transformation of alienating labor into meaningful creative activity

Production for use enables dramatic reduction in overall material
throughput. Most contemporary production serves not human needs but
capital accumulation - eliminating capitalist waste could reduce
resource consumption while improving quality of life.

### Distribution According to Need

Market distribution ensures those with money get more while those
without get less, regardless of need. Decommodified distribution would
operate on the principle "from each according to ability, to each
according to need."

Practical models exist. Libraries loan books freely to all. Emergency
services respond to need, not ability to pay. Fire departments don't
charge or let houses burn. These demonstrate distribution according to
need within commodified societies - scaling this principle across all
provisioning requires ending market distribution entirely.

This does not mean equal shares of everything, but rather social
determination of needs and collective provisioning to meet them.
Handicapped people need more support, not the same as others. Children
need different things than adults. Need-based distribution requires
democratic processes for determining priorities and fair systems for
managing genuinely scarce resources.

### Gift Economies and Mutual Aid

Decommodified societies would operate substantially through gift
economies and mutual aid rather than market exchange. Gift relationships
create social bonds, reciprocity and community resilience that market
transactions destroy.

Indigenous societies worldwide have maintained gift economy practices
for millennia - potlatch systems, elaborate gift networks, commons
management regimes. These demonstrate alternatives to commodified social
relations. Contemporary mutual aid networks, time banks, really really
free markets, food shares and community care systems all prefigure
decommodified futures.

The key is universalizing these practices, making them society's
organizing principles rather than marginal alternatives within
capitalism.

### The Abolition of Money

Money facilitates commodification by abstracting exchange and enabling
accumulation. Its abolition would eliminate the mechanism through which
capital reproduces itself. Without money, hoarding becomes impossible
and production for profit becomes meaningless.

Practical alternatives include labor vouchers (non-transferable
certificates of contribution, destroyed on use), computerized accounting
of contributions and withdrawals, or complete abolition of accounting in
post-scarcity contexts. The specific mechanisms matter less than the
principle: provisioning must not depend on purchasing power.

## Practical Examples of Decommodification

### Water and Essential Services

Water demonstrates commodification's absurdity most clearly. Nature
provides water freely through precipitation and aquifers, yet
corporations claim exclusive access and sell it back to communities.
Private water companies push for laws criminalizing rainwater collection
while opposing community-owned treatment systems that operate far more
cheaply. Privatized water systems charge approximately 35% more than
public alternatives while delivering lower quality water, extracting
profit for shareholders at the expense of human need. Yet even
nationalized utilities can maintain commodified relationships if they
operate on market principles rather than direct provisioning.

Successful decommodification examples exist:

- **Kerala, India** operates community-owned water systems achieving 30%
  lower costs, superior maintenance and higher water quality compared to
  privatized alternatives. Democratic community control ensures
  accountability and need-based distribution.
- **Uruguay** constitutionally enshrined water as a human right, banned
  privatization and achieved universal access while reducing costs by
  40%. This demonstrates how removing profit motives improves both
  access and efficiency.

## Transport and Mobility

Transport commodification creates cascading social and ecological
disasters. Private automobile ownership requires extensive
infrastructure - roads, parking, fuel distribution networks - while
generating massive pollution, urban sprawl and traffic deaths. The
system persists because it profits manufacturers, oil companies and
construction firms, not because it serves human needs efficiently.

Comparison of commodified versus decommodified transport reveals stark
differences:

- **Infrastructure costs:** Rail systems require 60% less infrastructure
  investment than equivalent road networks. A single rail track moves
  50,000 people hourly compared to 2,500 for a highway lane.
- **Safety:** Rail transport causes 0.15 deaths per billion passenger
  miles versus 7.3 for road transport - nearly 50 times safer.
- **Environmental impact:** Rail produces 75% lower emissions while
  using one-third the land area of roads.
- **Maintenance:** Rail infrastructure costs 55% less to maintain than
  road systems.
- Yet most societies prioritize car-based transport because it generates
  more profit, despite being inferior by every rational measure.
- **Luxembourg** implemented nationwide free public transport, achieving
  70% reduction in car usage, improved air quality and reduced
  inequality. The program demonstrates that removing market barriers
  increases mobility while decreasing environmental impact.
- **Tallinn, Estonia** made public transport free, dramatically
  improving mobility for low-income residents and generating net
  economic benefits through reduced healthcare costs, improved
  productivity and decreased infrastructure strain.

European cities demonstrate alternatives to car dependency. In London
and Paris, private vehicles are liabilities rather than necessities -
slower and more expensive than public transport. Half as many Europeans
own cars compared to Americans, not from poverty but because extensive
public transport and community-oriented urban design make cars
unnecessary. These cities house tens of millions who travel primarily on
foot and public transport while accessing everything they need quickly
and conveniently.

### Food and Agriculture

For most of human history, food was not commodified. Even 300-600 years
ago, most workers rarely used money for food procurement.
Commodification transformed food from a direct relationship with land
into a market transaction, forcing dependence on wages and destroying
food sovereignty. Contemporary food commodification creates absurd
outcomes: food waste while people starve, massive transport of identical
goods in opposite directions, destruction of surplus to maintain prices,
and prioritization of profitable crops over nutritious ones. Supermarket
chains and agribusiness corporations extract value while farmers face
poverty and communities lose food security. Decommodified food systems
include community gardens and urban agriculture providing direct access
to food production, food cooperatives eliminating profit-taking
middlemen, community-supported agriculture connecting producers and
consumers directly, autonomous food networks during crises demonstrating
capacity for non-market provisioning, and indigenous food sovereignty
movements reclaiming traditional foodways. These examples show food
decommodification improves nutrition, reduces waste, strengthens
communities and increases resilience.

## Transitional Strategies for Decommodification

### Immediate Demands

While complete decommodification requires abolishing capitalism,
transitional demands can weaken commodification while building popular
power:

- **Universal free access to essentials:** Water, electricity, internet,
  public transport and basic food provision should be free at point of
  use, funded through wealth redistribution from the ruling class.
- **Abolition of artificial scarcity:** Remove intellectual property
  restrictions on medicines, seeds, software and knowledge. Information
  and lifesaving technology should never be commodified.
- **Right to repair and reuse:** Mandate product durability,
  repairability and parts availability. Ban planned obsolescence. This
  challenges commodification's requirement for continuous replacement
  purchases.
- **Housing decommodification:** Implement rent controls, expand social
  housing, support squatting and community land trusts. Housing is for
  living, not investment portfolios.
- **Workplace occupation and conversion:** Support workers seizing and
  operating enterprises as cooperatives. Every factory converted to
  worker control is a space partially freed from commodification.

### Confrontational Tactics Beyond Dual Power

Capitalists will not voluntarily surrender commodity production. Beyond
building alternatives, decommodification requires direct confrontation:

- **Fare strikes and free transit actions:** Collective refusal to pay
  for public transport, forcing its transformation into a free service.
- **Utility payment strikes:** Organized mass refusal to pay for water,
  electricity or other essentials when costs become unbearable.
- **Sabotage of enclosure:** Physical removal of fences, locks and
  barriers that prevent access to commons.
- **Blockades of extraction:** Preventing resource extraction that feeds
  commodity production, from logging blockades to pipeline resistance.

These tactics directly attack commodification while demonstrating
collective power to reorganize provisioning outside market logic.

### The Question of Scale

Critics argue decommodification cannot work at scale - that only markets
can coordinate complex economies. This ignores both historical evidence
and contemporary examples.

Large organizations worldwide operate internally on non-market
principles. Corporations don't use internal markets - departments don't
buy and sell between themselves. They plan. If capitalist firms can plan
internally, planned economies coordinating entire societies are clearly
possible.

Modern computation enables coordination far beyond what markets achieve.
Real-time monitoring of resource flows, needs assessment through
participatory processes, and algorithmic optimization of distribution
networks can coordinate production more efficiently than price signals
while eliminating market failures and profit-driven waste.

The Soviet Union's failures stemmed from maintaining wage labor,
commodity production and hierarchical control - not from planning
itself. Worker-controlled democratic planning would avoid these pitfalls
while achieving coordination impossible under market anarchy.

Decommodification at scale requires international coordination.
Localized attempts face pressure from global capital. Only worldwide
movements can create conditions for thorough decommodification,
demanding international networks of solidarity and mutual support,
sharing resources and knowledge across borders.

## Toward Decommodification: Strategy and Struggle

### Building Dual Power

Decommodification cannot be legislated into existence - it must be built
through struggle. This requires creating alternative institutions that
meet needs outside market logic while organizing to dismantle capitalism
and the state.

Worker cooperatives, community land trusts, solidarity economies,
autonomous zones - these create spaces of relative decommodification
within capitalism. While insufficient alone, they demonstrate
alternatives and build capacity for systemic transformation.

More confrontational approaches - squatting, expropriation, sabotage of
extractive industries, blocking privatization - directly attack
commodification while creating facts on the ground. The ZAD in France,
Zapatista autonomous municipalities, Rojava's experiments, recovered
factories in Argentina, all show aspects of decommodified organization
at various scales.

### Degrowth as Decommodification

The degrowth movement recognizes that ecological sustainability requires
dramatic reduction in overall material and energy throughput,
incompatible with capitalism's growth imperative. Degrowth and
decommodification are inseparable - reducing societal metabolism
requires ending production for profit and capital accumulation.

This means:

- Eliminating wasteful industries - advertising, planned obsolescence,
  financial speculation
- Reducing unnecessary production and consumption
- Shortening work hours while maintaining living standards
- Shifting from private consumption to communal provisioning
- Prioritizing care, creativity and community over accumulation

Degrowth must be achieved through decommodification rather than
austerity. The goal is better lives with less throughput, achievable
only by ending capitalism's dominance.

### Prefigurative Politics

Methods of struggle must embody desired futures - means and ends cannot
separate. Hierarchical revolutionary organizations that plan to abolish
hierarchy after seizing power merely reproduce domination in new forms.
History confirms this - every state socialist revolution preserved
commodification and exploitation while changing their management.

Decommodification requires prefigurative organizing: horizontal
decision-making, mutual aid, direct action, community self-management.
These methods both build capacity for running decommodified society and
prevent reproduction of oppressive dynamics within movements.

## Challenges and Considerations

Decommodification faces serious challenges. Capitalist classes will
violently resist expropriation. State power will suppress alternatives.
Overcoming these requires building popular movements capable of
defending themselves and newly decommodified spaces.

Transition periods will be messy. Complete decommodification cannot
happen overnight - the question is how to move steadily toward it while
meeting immediate needs. This requires tactical flexibility while
maintaining strategic clarity about where we're headed.

Not all decommodification benefits workers equally without conscious
attention to power dynamics. State-run systems can be as oppressive as
private ones. The goal is not merely changing ownership but transforming
social relations completely - eliminating boss-worker, ruler-ruled
divisions entirely.

International solidarity is essential. Localized decommodification faces
pressure from global capital. Only coordinated international movements
can create conditions for decommodification's success.

## Conclusion

Commodification represents capitalism's totalizing logic, transforming
everything into objects for sale and profit extraction. Its growth
imperative drives ecological collapse and social misery. Attempts to
reform commodification while preserving capitalism inevitably fail.

Decommodification offers an alternative: production for use,
distribution according to need, genuine community control of resources.
This requires abolishing both capitalism and the state, replacing them
with horizontal self-management and commons-based organization.

The path toward decommodification runs through struggle - building
alternatives while confronting and dismantling existing power
structures. Only a powerful, self-organized working class movement can
achieve this transformation. The choice is clear: decommodification and
ecological survival, or continued commodification and catastrophe.
