**Social Democracy** (commonly called **Democratic Socialism**, also
known as **Welfare Capitalism**, **Welfare Statism** or **Liberal
Socialism**) is the idea that society should be run by a representative
democracy that guarantees both positive and negative freedoms via a
welfare state, "<a   href="nationalisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of certain industries and
public services and regulations to protect workers.

Although Social Democracy's support for the state and capitalism will
cause an obvious conflict with anarchists, there is a great deal of
division over whether or not to support it. Figures like
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> have argued for limited support in order to win temporary
gains in

have argued that supporting it takes the energy out of other political
projects we could be taking

## History

### Origins

Social Democracy began in the early 1860s as a tendency within the
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> led by theorists who rejected

"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bakunin&#39;s">Bakunin's</a> idea of a violent

and instead advocating for the formation of

reforms to improve the standing of the

### Dominance in the First World

Following
"<a   href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a> and until the 1970s, social democracy became the norm in much of
the first world. Figures like
"<a   href="Gough_Whitlam.md" class="wikilink" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough
Whitlam</a> in Australia,
"<a   href="Olof_Palme.md" class="wikilink" title="Olof Palme">Olof Palme</a>
in Sweden, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson in the USA,
Clement Atlee in the UK and other figures are usually seen as the main
architects of social democracy. This period is correlated with some of
the highest amounts of prosperity and scientific innovation in the first
world.

### Repression in the Third World

However, things were not so bright in much of the third world, as first
world nations organised the assassinations and disruptions of left-wing
economies that threatened to build viable social democracy in the third
world (partially contributed to our unnaturally high amount of extreme
poverty). Leaders like "<a   href="Salvador_Allende.md" class="wikilink"
title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a> in
"<a   href="Chile.md" class="wikilink" title="Chile">Chile</a>, Juan Jose
Aravelo in Guatemala.

### Decline

Beginning in the 1970s, the
"<a   href="Ruling_Class.md" class="wikilink" title="ruling class">ruling
class</a> became increasingly anxious about a
'"<a   href="Crisis_of_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="crisis of democracy">crisis of democracy</a>' within much of the
first world, as protests and strikes began to impede the progress of
capitalism and bring the entire system into question. Police repressed
social movements and trade unions in several major battles, COINTELPRO
and several assassinations destroyed radical opposition to present
society and many other social movements were
"<a   href="Co-optation.md" class="wikilink" title="co-opted">co-opted</a>.
This set the stage for
"<a   href="austerity.md" class="wikilink" title="austerity">austerity</a> and
"<a   href="neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>, disastrous policies which has
led to increasing levels of unemployment, insecure work, mental illness,
low wages, insecure housing, destruction of the environment and
political authoritarianism.

The major exception to this has been Latin America, where in response to
numerous social upheavels and revolutions (the
"<a   href="Zapatista_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista Revolution">Zapatista Revolution</a>,
"<a   href="Bolivian_Water_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolivian Water War">Bolivian Water War</a> and
"<a   href="Argentinazo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Argentinazo">Argentinazo</a>, just to name a few) led to a string
of social democrats and socialists being elected to lead

an event known as the
"<a   href="Pink_Tide.md" class="wikilink" title="Pink Tide">Pink Tide</a>
throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. These governments
successfully reduced poverty in massive waves, had secured greater
rights for minorities and made significant measures to protect the
environment. But by the mid-2010s, most of these states had been hit by
major "<a   href="Capitalist_Crisis.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic crashes">economic crashes</a> or its politicians had
become seduced by corruption, leading to a surge in support for
right-wing and fascist candidates across Latin America known as the
"<a   href="Blue_Tide.md" class="wikilink" title="blue or brown tide">blue or
brown tide</a>.[^1]

### Potential Resurgence

Support for social democracy is growing across most of the population
within first world countries. Popular politicians like Bernie Sanders,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jacinta Ardern and Jeremy Corbyn demonstrate
potential for more social democracy, however, given the still weak
nature of unions and strong belief that voting alone can fix the system,
this seems unlikely.

## Criticisms

According to socialists

title="libertarian">libertarian</a> and
"<a   href="Authoritarian_Socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">authoritarian</a>), social democracy can be
criticised on numerous grounds:

- Social democracy creates a narrative where support for political
  parties in the most practical method to achieve change in the world,
  despite social democracy historically depending on the existence of
  large and strong

  unions</a> willing to carry out

- Social democracy is simply a new method to strengthen capitalism and
  neutralize working class resistance, upon sufficient neutralization of
  the

- Social democracy cannot resolve the fundamental problems of
