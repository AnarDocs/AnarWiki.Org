Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy</a>:

> The sub-tropical and tropical regions of South America were home to a
> multitude of differing cultural groups. Most of them were small in
> population with no political integration beyond a local level. Some
> were clearly anarchic; others were not.
>
> Dole points to several examples of South American forest Indians
> wherein a hereditary chieftainship was extremely powerful. A Sherente
> headman was obeyed when he ordered several other men to kill a man who
> had repeatedly abandoned his wife. Apinaye headmen ordered the
> execution of alleged sorcerers. A Shavante headman held five men to be
> dangerous to communal well-being and had them executed. The Cashinahua
> headman visited every family in his village each day and gave out
> orders for the day's activities. His permission was also required
> before a marriage could be contracted.
>
> Dole suggests that perhaps many of the known anarchic tribes in South
> America were once much less so and considers in some detail the case
> of the Kirikuru, a small group of about 145 persons who live in
> central Brazil.
>
> They have 'headmen' who have no authority or power, although they once
> had more before recent demographic and social disturbances. Disease
> has reduced the population of many groups to the point where they can
> no longer function as self-sufficient and separate entities.
> Consequently various remnant groups consolidate. Thus among the
> Kirikuru there are people from at least four different 'tribes'.
> Headmanship was normally a kind of hereditary office through the male
> line, but a man often dies before his eldest son matures so that one
> from another family is therefore appointed. This man himself may be
> from a family which had provided headmen in another tribe. Thus
> leadership is distributed among various families producing claims to
> succession in several patriliries so that the position becomes
> weakened. Dole argues that the strength of headmanship is tied to
> lineality because it provides a standardised and exclusive channel for
> the exercise and transmission of authority. Where, as with the
> Kirikuru, this disappears, the authority of the headman is undermined.
>
> In lieu of any chiefly power Kirikuru rely upon a number of diffuse
> sanctions. There is gossip, complaining, and ostracism. Alleged
> sorcerers and witches are killed; guilt in connection with a crime or
> evil is determined by divination. Any woman who looks on the secret
> flutes of the tribe is punished by gang rape.
>
> Lowie presents examples of the chiefly role among other South American
> tribes. The Caraja chief is wholly dependent on his villagers'
> goodwill. If they are dissatisfied with him they will only abandon
> him. The Tapuya chief was highly respected when he was leading his
> warriors, but at home he was not so honoured. The modern Taulipang
> "headman has very little to say until hostilities break out with
> another group" (Lowie, 1949, 341). The Jivaro likewise emphasise
> chieftainship only in time of war. Indeed, they have no term for chief
> in their vocabulary and their war leaders are only of a temporary
> kind. Actually over the long term a shaman may be the most influential
> man in a Jivaro community. He is a curer, a maker of love potions, a
> diviner of enemy activity and interpreter of omens of defeat or
> victory in war. At the same time he may also be the war leader.
>
> The more anarchic of the South American polities are made up of groups
> of kinsmen so that social relationships are kinship relationships. The
> chiefly role as Lowie sees it, entails acting as peacemaker,
> representing the group in foreign relations, welcoming visitors,
> directing economic activities and indulging in admonishing harangues
> (Lowie , 1949, 343).
>
> Pierre Clastres has focussed on the more anarchic tribes in South
> America. He asks why the chief should have no power. He recognises the
> chief's importance as a peacemaker and mediator, but argues that these
> functions should not be confused with the nature of chieftainship. To
> explain this nature we must turn to the relationship of the chiefly
> role to reciprocity. The chief is involved in an exchange entailing
> women, words and wealth. Most of these Indians practise polygyny. The
> chief is always the man with the most wives; often the only polygynist
> in the group. At the same time the chief is expected to enthral the
> group with his oratory - no speech, no chief. He must sponsor feasts,
> support the community in hard times and always demonstrate his
> magnanimity and generosity. Through these mechanisms the chief
> continually strives to validate and revalidate his position. But such
> demonstrations are not, as one might think, proper reciprocations to
> the community·.for the excess of wives or the position the chief has.
> Women are of s11tt:h 'consummate' value that all the words and all the
> gifts provided by tpe chief are insufficient to qualify the situation
> as a reciprocal, that is, equal exchange. As such the chief in his
> position defies reciprocity, that basic law of social relations. Such
> an asymmetrical relatibnship is identified with power and that in turn
> with nature. In opposition to them stand reciprocity,[^1] society and
> culture. People in archaic societies, realising this conflict and the
> contradiction of the fundamental social law, see power as enjoying a
> privileged position. It is therefore dangerous and in need of
> restraint:; in fact 'power' should be made 'impotent' . The final
> synthesis in this dialectic is paradoxical. The chief's most
> unreciprocal acquisition of multiple wives puts him in a condition of
> perpetual indebtedness to his people, so that he must become their
> servant.
>
> Clastres' argument is both plausible and logical. Yet reason and logic
> alone are clearly insufficient grounds for accepting a theory. For the
> more empirically-minded, Clastres' explanation, like other
> structuralist explanations, seems strangely detached from the solid
> earth. The use of hard evidence to demonstrate the theory is lacking.
> We are given no idea of what the individuals involved may think. But
> then the structuralists argue that these things are superficial
> appearances, not the world in reality, the deep, underlying structure.
> Structuralism, like Freudianism, Jungianism and, to a lesser extent,
> Marxism, suffers from the problem of testability. A scientific
> hypothesis or theory should be so constructed that it is falsifiable.
> It should be subject to empirical test such that different
> investigators should be able to analyse the same phenomenon and
> validate the hypothesis by independently coming to the same
> conclusions. Strangely enough both Levi­ Strauss and Clastres have
> investigated the chiefly role in South America according to
> structuralist principles, but have apparently reached different
> conclusions about it. In contrast to Clastres, Levi-Strauss offers the
> usual conservative explanation that a true reciprocal relationship is
> involved. (Levi-Strauss, 309). Clastres correctly expresses concern
> about the ethnocentrism inherent in much political anthropology and in
> cultural evolutionary doctrine. He also calls our attention to the
> opposition and tension between reciprocity and leadership.

[^1]: Such emphasis upon reciprocity perhaps implicitly over-emphasises
    the altruism involved, neglecting the fact that many people do not
    give m the 'spint' of reciprocity so much as out of a fear of
    reprisal if they do not give (Colson, 1974, 48).
