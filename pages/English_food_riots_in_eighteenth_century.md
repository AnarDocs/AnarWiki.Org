"The food riot in eighteenth-century England was a highly-complex form
of direct popular action, disciplined and with clear objectives," argues
the historian E.P. Thomspson.[^1] While other scholars had interpreted
food riots as apolitical "rebellions of the belly," Thompson insists
that rioters had agency and that their crowd actions had coherent
political content. Specifically, the rioters resisted the excesses of
market capitalism and wanted to protect an earlier "moral economy" that
protected poor people's rights to subsistence.

Riots broke out in 1709, 1740, 1756-1757, 1766-1767, 1773, 1782, 1785,
and 1800-1801.[^2] Poor folks rose up most immediately in protest of
rising food prices.

"Initiators of the riots were, very often women," Thompson observes. In
1693, a large crowd of women went to the Northampton market with knives,
determined to get corn at fair rates.[^3] In December 1800, the
government introduced the Brown Bread Act banning millers from making
anything but wholemeal flour. Women stormed a mill and cut the meal
cloth into a thousand pieces. "As a result of such actions, the Act was
repealed in less than two months."[^4]

Rioters championed the "moral economy of the poor”—embodied in statute
law, common law, and custom law—that said the following. Farmers should
bring corn in bulk to the market and sell directly to consumer. Markets
should be controlled, and the poor should buy what they need before
dealers are allowed to start buying from the farmers. Millers and bakers
should work for a fair allowance rather than for a profit.[^5] This
vision did, to a large extent, reflect an actual economic arrangement
that had existed prior to increased market liberalization.

The main effects of the riots were long-term. Over hundreds of years,
fears and threats of riots kept prices down. Actual uprisings, however
occasional, gave these threats real power.[^6] Playing on this fear, the
poor commonly made threats against the rich. For example, a 1766 letter
said in rhyme:

> ...there is a small Army of us upwards of three thousand all ready to
> fight & I’ll be dam’d if we don’t make the King’s Army to shite If so
> be the King & Parliment don’t order better we will turn England into a
> Littler & if so be as things don’t get cheaper I’ll be damd if we
> don’t burn down the Parliament House & make all better[^7]
