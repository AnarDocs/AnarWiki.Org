*See Also: <a href="Timeline_of_Anarcho-Syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Timeline of Anarcho-Syndicalism">Timeline of
Anarcho-Syndicalism</a>*

### Precursors

Some argue that <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon&#39;s">Proudhon's</a> writings contain the first hints
of syndicalism. But <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> lay much of the theoretical
groundwork for anarcho-syndicalism. Arguing that workers forming trade
unions and striking would be a necessity for the working class to
realise its potential in running society in a directly democratic way.

Syndicalism's direct roots were in
<a href="Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre Joseph Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a>'s
<a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">mutualism</a>, a form of
<a href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialism">socialism</a>
that focused on cooperation among the community of man. He coined
*<a href="capitalist.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>*
to describe the political class granting itself monopolies on the use of
capital, and wanted workers to oppose this state control through
peaceful means, only using force defensively. Proudhon's ideas were
popular in the <a href="anti-authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> wing of the early
<a href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA), the first international socialist
organization, formed in 1864.

### Origins

Syndicalist unions first emerged in Spain and North America in the
1870s, before rising to prominence in France and later emerging on other
continents. The
<a href="Spanish_Regional_Federation_of_the_IWA.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA">Spanish Regional
Federation of the IWA</a>, which was formed in 1870, was in fact
syndicalist. According to
<a href="Émile_Pouget.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Pouget">Émile
Pouget</a>, a French anarchist and CGT leader, from "the United States,
the idea of the general strike— fertilized by the blood of anarchists
hanged in Chicago ...— was imported to France". In the 1890s, French
anarchists, conceding that individual action such as assassinations had
failed, turned their focus to the labor movement.

### First Organisations

1910 - <a href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT)

1912 - <a href="Unione_Sindacale_Italiana.md" class="wikilink"
title="Unione Sindacale Italiana">Unione Sindacale Italiana</a> (USI)

1922 - <a href="International_Workers&#39;_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workers&#39; Association">International Workers'
Association</a>

### Rise to Prominence

Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, anarcho-syndicalism became the dominant
revolutionary ideology among much of the lower classes in Europe, the
USA and South America. Major syndicalist organizations included the
<a href="General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France).md" class="wikilink"
title="General Confederation of Labor">General Confederation of
Labor</a> (CGT) in France, the
<a href="Confederacion_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo">Confederacion Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT) in Spain, the
<a href="Italian_Syndicalist_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Italian Syndicalist Union">Italian Syndicalist Union</a> (USI),
the <a href="Free_Workers&#39;_Union_of_Germany.md" class="wikilink"
title="Free Workers&#39; Union of Germany">Free Workers' Union of
Germany</a> (FAUD), and the
<a href="Argentine_Regional_Workers&#39;_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Argentine Regional Workers&#39; Federation">Argentine Regional
Workers' Federation</a> (FORA).

### Rapid Decline

Despite their many victories for the working class, anarcho-syndicalist
organisations were rapidly destroyed with the rise of fascism.

### Irrelevance

After the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> and destruction of the
CNT, anarcho-syndicalism had little to no relevance anywhere. They
organised no strikes and didn't really grow as a movement. The 1940s and
1950s saw the rise of <a href="Suburbia.md" class="wikilink"
title="suburbanisation">suburbanisation</a> and
<a href="Social_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a>, meaning that the working
class felt secure and the need for radical unionism ended. The remaining
radical left began to support the USSR, as it remained the only
functioning example of a society produced by leftist ideals, in
comparison to the failure of the Spanish Revolution.

### Resurgence

With the fall of the dictatorship of Spain and return of many CNT exiles
to Spain and the reformation of the union. New groups all across the
world formed in inspiration.

### 21st Century

Anarcho-Syndicalism has steadily grown in the 21st century, even if it
remains relatively small in comparison to other ideologies.

## Organisation

Syndicalists formed different kinds of organizations. Some like the
French radicals worked within existing unions to infuse them with their
revolutionary spirit. Some found existing unions entirely unsuitable and
built federations of their own, a strategy known as *dual unionism*.
American syndicalists formed the IWW, although
<a href="William_Z._Foster.md" class="wikilink"
title="William Z. Foster">William Z. Foster</a> later abandoned the IWW
after a trip to France and set up the
<a href="Syndicalist_League_of_North_America.md" class="wikilink"
title="Syndicalist League of North America">Syndicalist League of North
America</a> (SLNA), which sought to radicalize the established
<a href="American_Federation_of_Labor.md" class="wikilink"
title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>
(AFL).

Syndicalist trade unions declared their political neutrality and
autonomy from political parties. Syndicalists reasoned that political
parties grouped people according to their political views, uniting
members of different classes, while unions were to be purely
working-class organizations, uniting the entire class, and could
therefore not be divided on political grounds.

## Syndicalist Economics

### Critique of Capitalism

Syndicalists held that society was divided into two great classes, the
working class and the bourgeoisie. Their interests being irreconcilable,
they must be in a constant state of
<a href="class_struggle.md" class="wikilink" title="class struggle">class
struggle</a>. According to syndicalist doctrine, this war was aimed not
just at gaining concessions such as higher wages or a shorter working
day but at the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.

Syndicalists agreed with
<a href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s
characterization of the
<a href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> as the
"executive committee of the ruling class". They held that a society's
economic order determined its political order and concluded that the
former could not be overthrown by changes to the latter.

### Workers' Control

In the syndicalist conception, unions played a dual role. They were
organs of struggle within capitalism for better working conditions, and
they were also to play a key role in the revolution to overthrow
capitalism. For unions to fulfill this role, it was necessary to prevent
bureaucrats from inhibiting workers' militant zeal. Battling bureaucracy
and reformism within the labor movement was a major theme for
syndicalists.

Labor unions were seen as being the embryo of a new society in addition
to being the means of struggle within the old. Syndicalists generally
agreed that in a free society production would be managed by workers.
The state apparatus would be replaced by the rule of workers'
organizations. In such a society, individuals would be liberated in the
economic sphere but also in their private and social lives.

## Syndicalist Revolutionary Plans

### Direct Action

Syndicalists advocated
<a href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>, including <a href="working_to_rule.md" class="wikilink"
title="working to rule">working to rule</a>, passive resistance,
sabotage, and strikes, particularly the general strike, as tactics in
the class struggle, as opposed to indirect action such as electoral
politics. The IWW engaged in around 30 mostly successful civil
disobedience campaigns they deemed
<a href="free_speech_fights.md" class="wikilink"
title="free speech fights">free speech fights</a>. Sabotage ranged from
slow or inefficient work to destruction of machinery and physical
violence.

### The General Strike

The final step towards revolution according to syndicalists would be a
general strike. According to
<a href="Victor_Griffuelhes.md" class="wikilink"
title="Victor Griffuelhes">Victor Griffuelhes</a>, it would be "the
curtain drop on a tired old scene of several centuries, and the curtain
raising on another". Syndicalists remained vague about the society they
envisioned to replace capitalism, stating that it was impossible to
foresee in detail.

### Post-Revolutionary Society

Syndicalists generally agreed that in a free society production would be
managed by workers. The state apparatus would be replaced by the rule of
workers' organizations. In such a society, individuals would be
liberated in the economic sphere but also in their private and social
lives. The new society would be organized around industrial federations
coordinating production, with decision-making power resting in the hands
of workers' assemblies.

## Criticism

Syndicalism faced criticism from various quarters.
<a href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> and other Marxists argued that
syndicalists' rejection of political action weakened the revolutionary
movement and that workers needed a revolutionary party to guide them.
Social democrats criticized syndicalism's revolutionary aims and
preference for direct action over parliamentary politics.

Critics also pointed to syndicalism's inherent weaknesses: the
contradiction of building organizations that sought to be both
revolutionary cadre organizations and mass labour unions, the emphasis
on economic struggle to the detriment of political action, and the
commitment to localism limiting its ability to provide effective
centralized organization and leadership.
