Jewish Anarchists in Alexandria established the Social Studies Club in
1903. A number of similar Anarchist study groups were established in
Egypt in the preceding and following years. [^1] Egypt's Anarchist
movement, pioneered by Italian immigrants in the 1860s, attracted
significant participation from native Egyptians after 1900. The movement
became prominent in labor struggles and struggled against British
occupation alongside the nationalist movement.[^2]
