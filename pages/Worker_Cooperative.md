## Explanations for Rarity

Despite generally offering greater rates of productivity and higher
worker happiness, worker cooperatives are exceptionally rare in
capitalist economies, making up less than 1% of total GDP in most
capitalist countries. This apparent paradox has many explanations.

- Worker cooperatives have difficulty raising startup funds
- Worker cooperatives are often connected to the political left, who's
  members usually don't want to start businesses
- Many people aren't aware of worker cooperatives
- Many major businesses have monopoly's and that causes many problems
  for worker cooperatives
