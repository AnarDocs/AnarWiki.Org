## Dictionary Definitions

### Anarchy

**Anarchy = Without Rulers**

**Collins Dictionary** - From Medieval Latin anarchia, from Greek
anarkhia, from anarkhos without a ruler, from an- + arkh- leader, from
arkhein to rule[^1]

**Encyclopedia Britannica** - The term anarchy is derived from the
ancient Greek root anarchos ("without authority"), denoting the absence
of the rule of law or of settled government.[^2]

**Wikipedia** - As a concept, anarchy is commonly defined by what it
excludes. Etymologically, anarchy is derived from the Greek: αναρχία,
romanized: anarchia; where "αν" ("an") means "without" and "αρχία"
("archia") means "ruler". Therefore, anarchy is fundamentally defined by
the absence of rulers.[^3]

### Anarchism

**Anarchism = The belief that societies without rulers is possible and
desirable**

**Miriam Webster Dictionary** - A political theory holding all forms of
governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating
a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of
individuals and groups.[^4]

**Cambridge Dictionary** - The political belief that there should be
little or no formal or official organization to society but that people
should work freely together.[^5]

**Collins dictionary** - Anarchism is the belief that the laws and power
of governments should be replaced by people working together freely.[^6]

**Encyclopedia Britanica** - anarchism, cluster of doctrines and
attitudes centred on the belief that government is both harmful and
unnecessary.[^7]

**Wikipedia** - Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that
seeks to abolish all institutions that perpetuate authority, coercion,
or hierarchy, primarily targeting the state and capitalism. Anarchism
advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and
voluntary free associations. A historically left-wing movement,
anarchism is usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist
movement (libertarian socialism).[^8]

**Stanford Encyclopaedia Of Philosophy** - Anarchism is a political
theory that is skeptical of the justification of authority and power.
Anarchism is usually grounded in moral claims about the importance of
individual liberty, often conceived as freedom from domination.
Anarchists also offer a positive theory of human flourishing, based upon
an ideal of equality, community, and non-coercive consensus
building.[^9]

**The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy** - Anarchism is the
view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible
and desirable.[^10]

## Quotes About Anarchism

### Short Quotes

**<a href="Edward_Abbey" class="wikilink" title="Edward Abbey">Edward
Abbey</a>** - 'Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few
men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to
rule others.'[^11]

**Edward Abbey** - 'Anarchism is not a romantic fable but the hardheaded
realization, based on five thousand years of experience, that we cannot
entrust the management of our lives to kings, priests, politicians,
generals, and county commissioners.'[^12]

**<a href="Anselme_Bellegarrigue" class="wikilink"
title="Anselme Bellegarrigue">Anselme Bellegarrigue</a>** - 'Indeed: Who
says anarchy, says negation of government; who says negation of
government says affirmation of the people; who says affirmation of the
people, says individual liberty; who says individual liberty, says
sovereignty of each; who says sovereignty of each, says equality; who
says equality, says solidarity or fraternity; who says fraternity, says
social order. … Yes, anarchy is order, whereas government is civil
war.'[^13]

**<a href="Murray_Bookchin" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>** - 'Almost anyone, I
suppose, can call himself or herself an anarchist, if he or she believed
that the society could be managed without the state. And by the state—I
don't mean the absence of any institutions, the absence of any form of
social organisation—the state really refers to a professional apparatus
of people who are set aside to manage society, to preëmpt the control of
society from the people. So that would include the military, judges,
politicians, representatives who are paid for the express purpose of
legislating, and then an executive body that is also set aside from
society. So anarchists generally believe that, whether as groups or
individuals, people should directly run society.'[^14]

**<a href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>** - 'Anarchism, to
me, means not only the denial of authority, not only a new economy, but
a revision of the principles of morality. It means the development of
the individual as well as the assertion of the individual. It means
self-responsibility, and not leader worship.'[^15]

**<a href="Alex_Comfort" class="wikilink" title="Alex Comfort">Alex
Comfort</a>** - 'Anarchism is that political philosophy which advocates
the maximization of individual responsibility and the reduction of
concentrated power — regal, dictatorial, parliamentary: the institutions
which go loosely by the name of "government" — to a vanishing
minimum.'[^16]

**<a href="Mohandas_Gandhi" class="wikilink"
title="Mohandas Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a>** - 'The ideally non-violent
state will be an ordered anarchy. That State is the best governed which
is governed the least.'[^17]

**<a href="Peter_Gelderloos" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">Peter Gelderloos</a>** - 'An anarchist is not
someone who favors chaos but someone who favors the total liberation of
the world through the abolition of capitalism, government, and all other
forms of oppressive authority, to be replaced by any number of other
social arrangements, proven or utopian.'[^18]

**<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>** - 'Anarchy stands for the liberation of the human mind
from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the
dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraints of
government.'[^19]

**Emma Goldman** - 'ANARCHISM: The philosophy of a new social order
based on liberty unrestricted by man-made law; the theory that all forms
of government rest on violence, and are therefore wrong and harmful, as
well as unnecessary.'[^20]

**Emma Goldman** - 'Anarchism, the great leaven of thought, is today
permeating every phase of human endeavor. Science, art, literature, the
drama, the effort for economic betterment, in fact every individual and
social opposition to the existing disorder of things, is illumined by
the spiritual light of Anarchism. It is the philosophy of the
sovereignty of the individual. It is the theory of social harmony. It is
the great, surging, living truth that is reconstructing the world, and
that will usher in the Dawn.'[^21]

**<a href="David_Graeber" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a>** - 'Most of all, anarchism is just a matter of having the
courage to take the simple principles of common decency that we all live
by, and to follow them through to their logical conclusions.'[^22]

**David Graeber** - 'At their very simplest, anarchist beliefs turn on
to two elementary assumptions. The first is that human beings are, under
ordinary circumstances, about as reasonable and decent as they are
allowed to be, and can organize themselves and their communities without
needing to be told how. The second is that power corrupts.'[^23]

**David Graeber** - 'Anarchists believe that power corrupts and those
who spend their entire lives seeking power are the very last people who
should have it. Anarchists also believe that our present economic system
is more likely to reward people for selfish and unscrupulous behavior
than for being decent, caring human beings. Most people feel that way.
The only difference is that most people don't think there's anything
that can be done about it, or anyway — and this is what the faithful
servants of the powerful are always most likely to insist — anything
that won't end up making things even worse.'[^24]

**<a href="Ammon_Hennacy" class="wikilink" title="Ammon Hennacy">Ammon
Hennacy</a>** - 'An anarchist is someone who doesn't need a cop to make
him behave. Anarchism is voluntary cooperation with the right of
secession. The individual or the family or the small group as a unit
instead of the State.'[^25]

**Ammon Hennacy** - 'Anarchism has been called non-state Socialism.
Despite the popular idea of anarchists as violent men, Anarchism is the
one non-violent social philosophy. It is the very antithesis of
Communism and Fascism, which place the State as supreme. Anarchists will
do away with the State entirely. The function of the Anarchist is
two-fold. By daily courage in non-cooperation with the tyrannical forces
of the State and the Church, he helps to tear down present society; the
Anarchist by daily cooperation with his fellows in overcoming evil with
good-will and solidarity builds toward the anarchistic commonwealth
which is formed by voluntary action with the right of secession. The
basis of Anarchism is liberty with individual responsibility; its
methods are decentralization of activity and federation of local
communes for national and international functions.'[^26]

**<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>** - 'ANARCHISM (from the Gr. , and , contrary to
authority), the name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct
under which society is conceived without government — harmony in such a
society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any
authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups,
territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of
production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite
variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.'[^27]

**<a href="Nestor_Makhno" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a>** - 'Anarchism's outward form is a free, non-governed
society, which offers freedom, equality and solidarity for its members.
Its foundations are to be found in man's sense of mutual responsibility,
which has remained unchanged in all places and times. This sense of
responsibility is capable of securing freedom and social justice for all
men by its own unaided efforts. It is also the foundation of true
communism.'[^28]

**<a href="Errico_Malatesta" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>** - 'By definition an
anarchist is he who does not wish to be oppressed nor wishes to be him
self an oppressor; who wants the greatest well-being, freedom and
development for all human beings. His ideas, his wishes have their
origin in a feeling of sympathy, love and respect for humanity: a
feeling which must be sufficiently strong to induce him to want the
well-being of others as much as his own, and to renounce those personal
advantages, the achievement of which, would involve the sacrifice of
others.'[^29]

**<a href="Johann_Most" class="wikilink" title="Johann Most">Johann
Most</a>** - 'Anarchism means itself a new social order, and anyone who
knows human life from its depths to its heights, and has the courage to
fling aside all patching up and smoothing down, all bargaining and
compromising, and draw the necessary conclusions from past evolution,
must arrive at the very principle on which this new order shall be built
up. Our principle is: to prevent all command over man by his fellowmen,
to, make state, government, laws, or whatsoever form of compulsion
existing, a thing of the past, to establish full freedom for all.
Anarchism means first and foremost freedom from all government.'[^30]

**<a href="Lucy_Parsons" class="wikilink" title="Lucy Parsons">Lucy
Parsons</a>** - 'The philosophy of anarchism is included in the word
"Liberty," yet it is comprehensive enough to include all things else
that are conducive to progress. No barriers whatever to human
progression, to thought, or investigation are placed by anarchism;
nothing is considered so true or so certain, that future discoveries may
not prove it false; therefore, it has but one infallible, unchangeable
motto, "Freedom": Freedom to discover any truth, freedom to develop, to
live naturally and fully.'[^31]

**<a href="Donald_Rooum" class="wikilink" title="Donald Rooum">Donald
Rooum</a>** - 'Anarchism is opposed to states, armies, slavery, the
wages system, the landlord system, prisons, monopoly capitalism,
oligopoly capitalism, state capitalism, bureaucracy, meritocracy,
theocracy, revolutionary governments — patriarchy, matriarchy, monarchy,
oligarchy, protection rackets, intimidation by gangsters, and every
other kind of coercive institution. In other words, anarchism opposes
government in all its forms.'[^32]

**<a href="Henry_David_Thoreau" class="wikilink"
title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>** - 'I heartily
accept the motto,—"That government is best which governs least"; and I
should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.
Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,—"That
government is best which governs not at all"; and when men and women are
prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will
have.'[^33]

**<a href="J.R.R._Tolkien" class="wikilink" title="J.R.R. Tolkien">J.R.R.
Tolkien</a>** - 'My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy
(philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered
men with bombs) … The most improper job of any man … is bossing other
men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek
the opportunity.'[^34]

**<a href="Leo_Tolstoy" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>** - 'The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation
of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without authority,
there could not be worse violence than that of authority under existing
conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be
instituted by a revolution. "To establish Anarchy." "Anarchy will be
instituted." But it will be instituted only by there being more and more
people who do not require protection from governmental power, and by
there being more and more people who will be ashamed of applying this
power.'[^35]

**<a href="Benjamin_Tucker" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>** - 'Anarchism is for
liberty, and neither for nor against anything else. Anarchy is the
mother of co-operation, — yes, just as liberty is the mother of order;
but, as a matter of definition, liberty is not order nor is Anarchism
co-operation. I define Anarchism as the belief in the greatest amount of
liberty compatible with equality of liberty; or, in other words, as the
belief in every liberty except the liberty to invade.'[^36]

**<a href="Charlotte_Wilson" class="wikilink"
title="Charlotte Wilson">Charlotte Wilson</a>** - 'The genuine Anarchist
looks with sheer horror upon every destruction, every mutilation of a
human being, physical or moral. He loathes wars, executions and
imprisonments, the grinding down of the worker's whole nature in a
dreary round of toil, the sexual and economic slavery of women, the
oppression of children, the crippling and poisoning of human nature by
the preventable cruelty and injustice of man to man in every shape and
form.'[^37]

### Poetry

**<a href="John_Henry_Mackay" class="wikilink"
title="John Henry Mackay">John Henry Mackay</a>** - Anarchy

    Ever reviled, accursed, ne'er understood,
    Thou art the grisly terror of our age.
    "Wreck of all order," cry the multitude,
    "Art thou, and war and murder's endless rage."

    O, let them cry. To them that ne'er have striven
    The truth that lies behind a word to find,
    To them the word's right meaning was not given.
    They shall continue blind among the blind.

    But thou, O word, so clear, so strong, so pure,
    Thou sayest all which I for goal have taken.
    I give thee to the future! Thine secure
    When each at least unto himself shall waken.

    Comes it in sunshine? In the tempest's thrill?
    I cannot tell–but it the earth shall see!
    I am an Anarchist! Wherefore I will
    Not rule, and also ruled I will not be!
