In all of North America, Appalachia's Blue-Ridge forests and mixed
mesophytic forests have the greatest number of plant and animal species
unique to an area. The forests stretch through Alabama, Georgia,
Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee,
Virgnia, and West Virginia.

As in any ecosystem, decentralized networks of beings interact in ways
that stabilize the entire system. Energy flows from plants to the
animals that consume them, to decomposers (microbes) that process animal
carcasses, and back to the plants. As in any forest, the trees are
connected underground through a vast
"<a   href="mycorrhizal_network.md" class="wikilink"
title="mycorrhizal network">mycorrhizal network</a> in which trees and
fungi share resources and information with each other.

In the Blue-Ridge mountains, plant species include magnolias, hickory,
sassafras, ginseng and mayapple. Animals include red salamanders, black
bears, and freshwater mussels. In the mesophytic forests, plants include
ginseng, and animals include bobcats, land snails, and songbirds.[^1]

According to Cherokee mythology, there once was no land, only water and
sky. Animals lived above the sky, but one day the water beetle ventured
into the water, found mud at the bottom, and brought some mud back to
the surface and left it there to dry. The mud grew and grew until it
formed land. The animals decided that once the mud dried, they would go
make their homes on it. Volunteering to see if the mud had dried, the
Great Buzzard flew down from the sky. Flying above the drying land, he
became tired. His wings hit the ground, forming the mountains and
valleys that exist today.[^2]

Cherokees named the land Ketuah and considered its plants, animals,
mountains and rivers to have spiritual powers. Killing any animal
(except bears, who they said had declared a failed war on the humans)
required a ceremony to show respect, and virtually all parts of the
hunted animals were used.[^3] Cherokees altered the land in a number of
ways: burning underbrush to improve visibility for hunting and encourage
deers to forage, clearing forests to build villages and to grow corn,
beans, squash and sunflowers.[^4] Cherokees held land in common and had
no centralized government until the eighteenth century.[^5]

In the words of the Beehive Design Collective, "People have migrated
through Appalachia for millennia, from First Nations folks to people
escaping enslavement...Survival in the pre-industrial world meant
resourcefulness, thrift, reusing old materials, and taking only what you
could carry. Appalachian communities relied on their neighbors and on
the food and fuel they could harvest themselves...Folks used and changed
the land to meet their needs, but they did so within the land’s ability
to replenish itself."[^6]

The Appalachian forests are currently threatened by coal mining and
logging, and the mountain justice movement has arisen to stop the strip
mining of coal and protect the Appalachian mountains and ecosystems.
Surface mining--including the practice known as "mountaintop
removal"--has destroyed over 500 Appalachian mountains.[^7] Coal
production is linked to increased rates of "chronic pulmonary disorders
and hypertension \[and...\] mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart,
lung, and kidney disease."[^8]
