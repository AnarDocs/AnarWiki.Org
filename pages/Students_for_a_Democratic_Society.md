Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was the largest student
organization and among the largest anti-war organizations in the United
States in the 1960s. Initially, it organized in a decentralized and
informal manner, albeit with a hierarchically-organized National Office
and a male-dominated culture. Its early manifesto, the Port Huron
Statement, called for participatory democracy and self-management. A few
of the student chapters adopted anarchistic politics, including the
University of Texas–Austin chapter and the MIT chapter. Some of the
non-student members were also Anarchists: the ‘’Anarchos’’ group that
included Murray Bookchin, the
"<a   href="Black_Mask.md" class="wikilink" title="Black Mask">"Black Mask</a>
chapter, and the Louis Lingg Memorial Chapter. There was overlap with
the "<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">"Industrial Workers of the
World</a>. By 1969, the Weathermen, a Maoist faction, had taken
leadership of the organization. SDS dissipated as Weathermen shifted
their energies away from grassroots organizing and toward high-profile
attacks on government and corporate property.

At its peak, SDS had about a hundred thousand official members.[^1]

# Organization

While SDS was committed to building a decentralized and democratic
society, it had mixed successes in organizing themselves along these
lines. On one hand, SDS chapters acted autonomously and formally
organized along relatively horizontal lines. On the other hand, the
establishment of the National Office during the 1962-1963 school year
initiated a minor bureaucracy within the group. Moreover, on an informal
level, charismatic men tended to dominate organizational processes.
People give somewhat differing accounts.

According to SDS member Mark Rudd, “SDS was always a loose confederation
of local chapters, more of a conglomeration than a single unified
organization. Each chapter could decide what issues to work on and what
positions to espouse. There was no constitution to guide it, only the
Port Huron Statement from 1962, which provided an orienting spirit of
“participatory democracy,” whatever that was. In 1969 it wasn’t likely
that too many of the active members, though, had even read our founding
document.”[^2]

In his study on SDS, Kirkpatrick Sale notes:

> SDS almost without even thinking of it became an organization of
> officers at the top and bureaucratic administrators below,
> constitutions and bylaws, parliamentary meetings and points of order,
> conventions and committees, mimeograph machines and official
> documents, letters in triplicate and bills paid monthly, lists of
> members and calculations of dues, accounts receivable and payable,
> mailing lists, files, phones, a central office. Plus all the attendant
> habits and characteristics that this suggests: the dominance of males,
> especially those who can talk and manipulate (sexually or politically)
> best; the emphasis on form, legality, precedent, rules; the
> unconscious division into those who lead and those who follow, those
> who talk and those who listen, those who propose and those who do,
> those who write the pamphlets and those who mimeograph them.[^3]

SDS elected its executive committee at annual conventions. In 1963,
presidents were limited to one year in office, and in 1967, the offices
of president and vice-president were abolished. In 1968, the national
secretary was replaced with three secretaries. Crucially, the National
Office always had “little power over the chapters.”[^4]

SDS member Cathy Wilkerson describes the challenges of women in the
group who were caught between SDS’s denunciation of “separatism” and the
women movement’s emphasis on autonomous women’s organizations:

> Women within SDS had to denounce separatism, you know, every five
> minutes in every discussion of women’s issues or they would not be
> allowed to continue. Yet when women tried to get together with
> separatists they were again challenged to say that working with men
> was bad, you know, all the time.[^5]

# History

*Parts of this section come from the article
"<a   href="Weather_Underground_and_Anarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Weather Underground and Anarchy">"Weather Underground and
Anarchy</a>.*

In 1960, members of the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID),
a small Old Left group, looked at how they might retune the organization
to fit the era’s ethos. They changed their name to Students for a
Democratic Society and shifted their central emphasis from labor
unionism to supporting the civil rights movement. In 1962, SDS published
the Port Huron Statement. A manifesto drafted by Tom Hayden, it charted
the values of the newly-named organization.[^6]

The Port Huron Statement called for “participatory democracy,” in which
society’s decision-making would be made by “public groupings” and would
bring people “out of isolation and into community.” The manifesto also
called for an economy that would be accountable to democratic regulation
and would based on “self-directed” labor. The Statement took issue with
racial discrimination, war, alienation, and environmental destruction.
The concluding section called for a “new left” that would tackle all
these issues and not be afraid to voice radical demands to that end: “If
we appear to seek the unattainable, as it has been said, then let it be
known that we do so to avoid the unimaginable.”[^7]

Several SDS chapters openly embraced an anti-authoritarian politics. The
chapter at University of Texas-Austin adopted many habits of the youth
counterculture, including smoking lots of marijuana and growing their
hair long but also scorning highly formal or bureaucratic organization.
According to old-guard SDS members, this chapter’s members “were
instinctive anarchists, principled and practiced
antiauthoritarians.”[^8] The chapter at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, named Rosa Luxemburg SDS, was advised by Noam Chomsky, the
Anarchist professor of linguistics. With members including future
"<a   href="Participatory_Society.md" class="wikilink"
title="Participatory Economics">"Participatory Economics</a> co-founder
Michael Albert, the group blockaded Dow Chemical’s campus recruitment
event and organized along with other radicals in the Boston area.[^9]

Anarchist politics were not restricted to students.
"<a   href="Black_Mask.md" class="wikilink" title="Black Mask">"Black Mask</a>,
an Anarchist street gang that engaged in militant direct actions—such as
briefly breaking into the Pentagon during an anti-war
demonstration—affiliated with SDS. The Louis Lingg Memorial Chapter in
Chicago was named after one of the Anarchist martyrs of the Haymarket
affair. Its statement of purpose declared opposition to “law and order.”
In New York, Murray Bookchin organized the Anarchos Group that briefly
coordinated an anti-authoritarian caucus within SDS.[^10]

SDS were at the forefront of the movement against the Vietnam War.
Following the Plei Ku attack in Februrary 1965, “SDSers were prominent
in leading actions at Brown/Pembroke, Carleton, Michigan, Minnesota,
Rutgers, Baltimore, Boston, and New York, and in sponsoring a
five-hundred-strong picket of the White House on February 20.”[^11]

1,000 people organized by the Student Afro-American Society, SDS, and
other groups occupied five buildings at Columbia University from 23
April to 30 April 1968. Police arrested more than 700 people.[^12]
Kirkpatrick Sale describes the occupation as a moment when many SDS
members realized that they had revolutionary aims.[^13] Along with
various Marxist groups, the anarchistic
"<a   href="Yippies.md" class="wikilink" title="Yippies">"Yippies</a> played a
role in the occupation.[^14]

By the time of its 1969 national conference, SDS was dominated by three
Marxist-Leninist factions. Anarchists distributed a pamphlet by Murray
Bookchin criticizing the dominant factions for clinging to an outdated
ideology. It was titled “Listen, Marxist!”:

> “All the old crap of the thirties is coming back again—the shit about
> the ‘class line,’ the ‘role of the working class,’ the ‘trained
> cadres,’ the ‘vanguard party,’ and the the ‘proletarian dictatorship.’
> \[…\] When the hell are we finally going to create a movement that
> looks to the future instead of the past?”[^15]

The 1969 conference became the site of a power struggle between Maoist
factions including Progressive Labor (PL) and the Weathermen. The former
rejected youth counterculture and black nationalism, while the latter
supported both. Borrowing a line from a Bob Dylan song, the Weathermen
circulated their manifesto “You Don’t Need a Weatherman to Know Which
Way the Wind Blows.” It called for a white youth vanguard to engage in
underground actions in support of black and Third World revolution.

In the summer of 1969, the Weathermen moved into collective houses and
began heavily promoting the “Days of Rage” that would kick off in
Chicago on 8 October 1969.[^16] They hoped that thousands of people
would show up and brawl with police. Members publicized the initiative
on college campuses and even commandeered high school classrooms in
attempts to recruit people.[^17] A few days before the action,
Weatherman blew up a statue at Haymarket Square commemorating the police
officers allegedly killed by Anarchists in 1886.[^18]

When the day came, only about 150 to 250 people actually showed up.
Confronting a massive police presence, they started breaking windows of
banks and other businesses. Police fired shots, wounding three people.

The Black Panthers’ Fred Hampton denounced the Days of Rage as
irresponsible:

> We believe that the Weatherman action is anarchistic, opportunistic,
> individualistic, it’s chauvanistic, it’s Custeristic. And that’s the
> bad part about it. It’s Custeristic in that its leaders take people
> into situations where the people can be massacred. And they call it
> revolution, and it’s nothing but child’s play, it’s folly. We think
> these people may be sincere but they’re misguided. They’re muddleheads
> and they’re scatterbrains.[^19]

The Yippies’ Abbie Hoffman questioned the strategic value of Weather’s
violence, calling it “Gandhian violence for the element of purging guilt
through moral witness.”[^20]

Weatherman found themselves extremely isolated and alone after the Days
of Rage. At this time, they decided to go underground and start calling
themselves the Weather Underground Organization. They also decided to
abandon the above-ground group SDS, since they wanted to focus on
underground activities. Rudd later regretted the decision:

> The destruction of SDS was probably the single greatest mistake I’ve
> made in my life (and I’ve made quite a few). It was a historical
> crime. The war was far from over—hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops
> were still in Vietnam, and we had yet to invade Cambodia and Laos. It
> would continue for five more years. We should have tried to use SDS to
> build as broad and powerful a movement to end the war as possible. Yet
> my friends and I chose to scuttle America’s largest radi- cal
> organization—with chapters on hundreds of campuses, a powerful
> national identity, and enormous growth potential—for a fantasy of
> revolutionary urban-guerrilla warfare. None of us in the Weather
> leadership, to my knowledge, were police agents either. We did it all
> ourselves. For decades I’ve been contemplating the wonder of this
> fact.[^21]
