# Anti-work

Marxism-Leninism (especially of the Tankie kind), despite critiquing
capitalist exploitation, fundamentally retains the view that humans
exist primarily as productive workers—merely redirecting that
productivity toward "the people" or "the revolution" rather than private
capital. While Marx distinguished between alienated labor under
capitalism and freely chosen creative production, his vision of
communist freedom remains centered on varied productive activities
rather than questioning the expectation of productivity itself. This
productivist logic intensifies under Marxist-Leninist stagism: during
the "lower phase" of socialism, compensation remains tied to productive
contribution ("from each according to ability, to each according to
work"), while liberation gets perpetually deferred to a future "higher
phase" once productive forces develop sufficiently. In contrast to some
other socialist approaches (such as anarchism) which that seek to
immediately transform social relations, Marxism-Leninism asks people to
accept their identity as productive workers indefinitely—demanding that
multiple generations sacrifice their freedom today to build the material
conditions for liberation tomorrow, a tomorrow that never quite arrives.
