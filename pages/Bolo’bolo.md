# Bolo'bolo

## Overview

***Bolo'bolo*** is a 1983 book by **P.M.**, a pseudonym for **Hans
Widmer**, in which he outlines a plan for
"<a   href="utopia.md" class="wikilink" title="utopia">utopia</a>. The work
presents both a critique of the current world system and a detailed
blueprint for an alternative
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
society based on decentralized intentional communities. P.M. describes
his vision as "part of (my) second reality" - a subjective alternative
to the dominant industrial civilization that could be realized globally
within five years if implemented immediately.

## Summary

### The Planetary Work Machine

The opening of *Bolo'bolo* describes and criticizes the current world
system, which P.M. calls the **Planetary Work Machine**. This machine is
characterized as a global system that has developed over three millennia
of civilization and 200 years of accelerated industrial progress,
transforming human society from the relatively agreeable existence of
hunter-gatherer times into a nightmare of compulsory labor,
environmental destruction, and social alienation.

P.M. describes the Machine as operating through three distinct worker
types:

- **A Workers** - Technical/intellectual workers in advanced Western
  countries, highly qualified and well-paid but suffering from stress,
  meaninglessness, and the emptiness of consumer society
- **B Workers** - Agro/industrial workers in socialist and "threshold"
  countries, experiencing the frustrations of socialism's inability to
  deliver on its promises while maintaining work discipline
- **C Workers** - Fluctuant workers in the Third World and urban slums,
  oscillating between agricultural work, service jobs, and unemployment,
  facing direct violence and exploitation

The Machine maintains control by playing these three types against each
other through mutual fear, prejudice, and competing interests. It has
become planetary in scope, "eating in Africa, digesting in Asia, and
shitting in Europe," controlled by international companies, banking
systems, and the circulation of goods and resources.

### Substruction Strategy

P.M. advocates undermining the system through **substruction** - a
combination of subversion and construction. This involves creating
**ABC-dysco** knots (encounters between all three worker types) that can
engage in coordinated **dysinformation**, **dysproduction**, and
**dysruption** to paralyze the Machine while simultaneously building
alternative structures.

The strategy emphasizes **tricommunication** (trico) - planetary
connections between dysco knots in Western countries, socialist
countries, and the Third World. P.M. provides a provisional schedule
suggesting bolo'bolo could be fully implemented by 1987, with various
stages of development leading to the collapse of the existing system and
establishment of autonomous regions.

### The Bolo System

The remainder of the work describes the theoretical future social order
using a constructed vocabulary. An **ibu** is an individual person or
ego - the basic human unit in the system. A **bolo** is an
"<a   href="intentional_community.md" class="wikilink"
title="intentional community">intentional community</a> of 300-500 ibus
that serves as the basic unit of social organization, typically
occupying one or two city blocks, a smaller neighborhood, or a complex
of adjacent buildings connected by arcades and overpasses. In rural
areas, a bolo might correspond to a small town or group of farmhouses.
Each bolo is characterized by:

**Nima** - The cultural identity or lifestyle that unites the community,
which could be based on ethnic traditions, philosophical currents,
shared interests, or newly invented ways of life. P.M. envisions diverse
bolos such as Alco-bolo, Vegi-bolo, Krishna-bolo, Punk-bolo, etc.

**Sila** - The hospitality rules that govern relationships between ibus
and bolos, including guarantees of food (yalu), shelter (gano), medical
care (bete), freedom of movement (fasi), cultural expression (nami), and
the right to suicide (nugo).

**Kodu** - The agricultural basis ensuring each bolo's self-sufficiency
in food production, typically involving three zones around urban bolos:
immediate gardens, nearby plots for fresh produce, and larger farms
within cycling distance.

**Sibi** - The fabricultural aspect covering production of tools,
clothing, furniture, and other necessities, often based on the bolo's
cultural specialization and productive passions.

Each ibu possesses a **taku** - a 50×50×100 cm container representing
the absolute limit of private property, within which anything can be
stored without inspection or interference.

### Social Organization

Bolos organize into larger structures for coordination and mutual aid:

- **Tega** - Townships of 10-20 bolos handling local infrastructure and
  services
- **Vudo** - Counties of 10-20 townships managing regional resources and
  larger projects
- **Sumi** - Autonomous regions providing high-level coordination and
  cultural identity
- **Asa** - The planetary assembly meeting alternately in Quito and
  Beirut to handle global concerns

These assemblies operate through delegate systems using lottery
selection and rotating observers from other regions to prevent
corruption and centralization.

### Exchange Systems

The communities trade through multiple mechanisms:

- **Buni** - Gifts as the most common form of exchange
- **Mafa** - Common pools of resources for mutual aid and emergency
  support
- **Feno** - Barter agreements for regular exchange of necessary goods
- **Sadi** - Local markets using non-convertible currencies for
  specialized items

### Transportation and Conflict

**Fasi** describes a transportation system emphasizing walking,
bicycles, and animals for local movement, with reduced rail and maritime
networks for long-distance travel. The slower pace allows for more
leisurely exploration and cultural exchange.

**Yaka** provides mechanisms for handling conflicts through formalized
dueling with traditional weapons, regulated by community committees to
limit damage while allowing for the expression of aggression and
disputes over honor.

## Implementation Timeline

P.M. presents a detailed schedule for transition:

- **1984** - Spread of bolo'bolo literature and formation of initial
  dysco knots
- **1985** - Development of networks fulfilling practical tasks and
  mutual aid
- **1986** - Emergence of independent regions and breakdown of state
  control
- **1987** - Collapse of international systems and establishment of
  autonomous regions
- **1988-2345** - The bolo'bolo period
- **2346** - Decline into chaos and contemplation
- **2763** - Beginning of new era with loss of historical records
