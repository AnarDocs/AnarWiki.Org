# Louis Lingg

**Louis Lingg** (September 9, 1864 – November 10, 1887) was a
German-born anarchist carpenter and one of the
"<a   href="Haymarket_Martyrs.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Martyrs">Haymarket Martyrs</a>, convicted in connection
with the "<a   href="Haymarket_affair.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket affair">Haymarket affair</a> of 1886. Rather than
submit to execution by the capitalist state, Lingg took his own life on
November 10, 1887, using an explosive device smuggled into his cell. His
final words, written in his own blood on the cell wall, were "Hoch die
anarchie!" (Hurrah for anarchy!). The trial that condemned him was
marked by perjured testimony, police corruption, and judicial bias—a
fact later acknowledged when Governor
"<a   href="John_Peter_Altgeld.md" class="wikilink"
title="John Peter Altgeld">John Peter Altgeld</a> pardoned Lingg's
co-defendants and stated that all the Haymarket defendants, including
those executed and Lingg himself, were innocent.

## Family

Louis Lingg was born to Friedrich Lingg and his wife in Mannheim. His
father worked in a lumber mill, while his mother operated a laundry to
supplement the family income. Louis had a younger sister, six years his
junior.[^1]

The family's circumstances changed dramatically when Friedrich suffered
a catastrophic accident while working. In his zeal to serve his
employer, Friedrich attempted to move logs on the frozen Neckar River—a
dangerous task other workers refused. He fell through the ice and nearly
drowned. Though rescued, the accident destroyed his health and working
capacity. After twenty years of service, his employer fired him,
claiming he was now "superfluous." Friedrich died three years later, in
1877, when Louis was only thirteen years old.[^2]

Louis later reflected on this formative experience: "At this time I was
thirteen and my sister seven years old, and at this age I received my
first impressions of the prevailing unjust social institutions, i.e.,
the exploitation of men by men."[^3] The contrast between his father's
sacrifice and the employer's enrichment planted the seeds of his
anarchist consciousness.

## Early Life

After his father's death, Lingg and his family lived in poverty. His
mother remarried, but the family struggled financially. Louis was
sometimes sent to collect debts from wealthy customers, only to be
turned away while they entertained guests. He later wrote: "Shortly, all
the incidents which I have narrated before, implanted into my mind the
seed of bitter hatred against the existing society, which feeling grew
still more intense with my entrance into the industrial arena."[^4]

At age five, Lingg began attending school, first the city elementary
school and later the mixed public school following the reorganization of
the German education system. Despite his family's poverty, his mother
ensured he had the school books he needed, though often at great
sacrifice.

When old enough, Lingg chose to become a carpenter rather than pursue
clerical work his mother preferred. He desired the independence a trade
would provide and wanted to see the world rather than be dependent on a
single master as his father had been. He served his apprenticeship from
1869 to 1882, during which time his employer exploited his labor rather
than properly training him.[^5]

### Political Awakening

After completing his apprenticeship, Lingg traveled through Europe to
perfect his trade and broaden his understanding. He worked briefly in
"<a   href="Strasbourg.md" class="wikilink" title="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>,
"<a   href="Alsace.md" class="wikilink" title="Alsace">Alsace</a>, then moved
to Freiburg, Germany, where he joined the Working Men's Educational
Society, a socialist organization descended from Lassalle's German
National Working Men's Union. Here he received his first substantial
education in socialist and communist theory.[^6]

In spring 1883, Lingg moved to "<a   href="Switzerland.md" class="wikilink"
title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> to avoid German military service,
which he refused on principle. He traveled extensively through the Swiss
cantons on foot, working in various cities including Bern, Luzern, and
Zurich. In these cities he participated in working men's societies,
where he encountered both social democratic and anarchist factions.
Through study and observation, Lingg concluded that centralized
organizations with representative systems concentrated power in the
hands of a few, leading to corruption, while rendering the masses
"indifferent and stupid." He embraced anarchism and the propaganda of
the deed.[^7]

The Swiss government, bound by treaty with Germany, repeatedly expelled
Lingg from various cantons for evading military service. He moved from
city to city, staying ahead of police surveillance. This experience of
being hounded by authorities in supposedly "free" Switzerland—one of
Europe's most democratic nations—deepened his revolutionary convictions
and his understanding that political freedom meant nothing without
economic justice.

In spring 1885, after being definitively ordered to leave Switzerland,
Lingg received funds from his stepfather to emigrate to America. He
departed via Havre, France, arriving in New York City in mid-July 1885.

## Adulthood

### Chicago and Labor Organizing

Upon arrival in Chicago, Lingg immediately sought work as a carpenter
and joined the "<a   href="International_Carpenters_and_Joiners&#39;_Union.md"
class="wikilink"
title="International Carpenters and Joiners&#39; Union">International
Carpenters and Joiners' Union</a>. He quickly encountered the
exploitation characteristic of American capitalism: lacking tools, he
was forced to pay his employer 75 cents daily—an exorbitant sum—merely
to use an axe and saw. When that job ended, he kept the tools as
"generous" compensation for his overpayments.[^8]

Despite arriving only seven months before the Haymarket events, Lingg
became well-known and respected within the labor movement. He was
elected as delegate to the Central Labor Union and served as organizer
for the International Carpenters and Joiners' Union. While he understood
that trade unionism alone could not emancipate the working class, he
participated actively, believing workers' disappointments with reformist
methods would radicalize them toward revolutionary action.[^9]

Lingg openly advocated force as a necessary response to the violence
wielded by police and capitalists against workers. He later explained:
"I tell you frankly and openly, I am for force. I have already told
Captain Schaack, 'if they use cannons against us, we shall use dynamite
against them.'"[^10]

### The Haymarket Affair

On May 4, 1886, a rally was held at
"<a   href="Haymarket_Square_(Chicago).md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Square">Haymarket Square</a> in support of the
eight-hour workday and in protest of police violence against striking
workers. Lingg was not present at the gathering. When police illegally
moved to disperse the peaceful assembly, an unknown person threw a bomb
into the police ranks, killing Officer Mathias Degan. The incident
provided authorities with the pretext they sought to crush the growing
anarchist movement.

Lingg was arrested on May 14, 1886, after a violent confrontation with
police who broke into his room under false pretenses. Police discovered
bombs in his apartment, which the prosecution used to link him to a
supposed conspiracy. Eight anarchists, including Lingg, were charged not
with actually throwing the bomb—which prosecutors could not prove—but
with conspiracy to commit murder. The trial was explicitly political:
State's Attorney Julius Grinnell admitted the defendants were being
tried "not for murder, but for anarchy."[^11]

The trial was a travesty of justice. The primary witness against Lingg
was William Seliger, a fellow carpenter who had rented him a room. After
being charged with murder himself, Seliger turned state's evidence in
exchange for having all charges dropped and being sent to Germany at
police expense.[^12] Under cross-examination, Seliger admitted he had
been paid by police multiple times, and that his wife had also received
payments of "twenty or twenty-five dollars."[^13]

Other evidence was equally dubious. Chemists could only state that
Lingg's bombs "bore a certain resemblance" to the Haymarket bomb, and
State's Attorney Ingham had to admit there was a half-inch difference in
diameter between them. Captain Schaack of the Chicago Police committed
perjury on the stand, falsely claiming Lingg admitted to attending
meetings he had not attended.[^14]

Despite the manufactured nature of the evidence, all eight defendants
were convicted. Lingg and six others were sentenced to death.

### Final Statement to the Court

At his sentencing, Lingg delivered a powerful condemnation of the
judicial system and capitalist society. He denounced Seliger as a
"bought squealer" and challenged the prosecution's failure to prove his
bombs were taken to the Haymarket. He rejected the legitimacy of the
court itself:

> "I do not recognize your law, jumbled together as it is by the
> nobodies of bygone centuries, and I do not recognize the decision of
> the court... I tell you frankly and openly, I am for force... I
> declare again, frankly and openly, that I am in favor of using force.
> I have told Captain Schaack, and I stand by it, 'if you cannonade us,
> we shall dynamite you.'"[^15]

He concluded with defiant prophecy:

> "I die happy on the gallows, so confident am I that the hundreds and
> thousands to whom I have spoken will remember my words; and when you
> shall have hanged us, then—mark my words—they will do the
> bombthrowing! In this hope do I say to you: I despise you. I despise
> your order, your laws, your force-propped authority. Hang me for
> it!"[^16]

### Personal Life

Little is recorded of Lingg's personal life during his brief time in
Chicago. In his autobiography, he alluded to a romantic relationship
during his time in Switzerland, mentioning "a daughter of the fabled
Eve" who motivated his frequent trips from Zurich to Bern.[^17]

Lingg was a freethinker, raised in a liberal environment where "teachers
inculcated substantial knowledge instead of beliefs in something about
which nobody knew anything." He rejected religious dogma and embraced
reason and empirical understanding.[^18]

## Death

On November 6, 1887, four additional bombs were discovered hidden in
Lingg's cell, demonstrating both his continued commitment to armed
resistance and the incompetence or complicity of his jailers.[^19]

On November 10, 1887—the day before his scheduled execution—Lingg
committed suicide using a blasting cap that had been smuggled to him by
a fellow prisoner, possibly with assistance from
"<a   href="Dyer_Lum.md" class="wikilink" title="Dyer Lum">Dyer Lum</a>, an
individualist anarchist sympathizer. At approximately 9:00 AM, Lingg
placed the explosive device in his mouth and detonated it. The blast
destroyed his lower jaw and much of his face. He survived for six
agonizing hours, during which he wrote "Hoch die anarchie!" (Hurrah for
anarchy!) on his cell wall in his own blood. He died around 3:00
PM.[^20]

Lingg's suicide was an act of defiance—a refusal to grant the state the
satisfaction of executing him. He died on his own terms, not theirs.

### Legacy

Lingg was buried at Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery) in
"<a   href="Forest_Park,_Illinois.md" class="wikilink"
title="Forest Park, Illinois">Forest Park, Illinois</a>, in a plot that
has been marked since 1893 by the
"<a   href="Haymarket_Martyrs&#39;_Monument.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Martyrs&#39; Monument">Haymarket Martyrs' Monument</a>.[^21]
This monument honors Lingg alongside the four anarchists who were
executed on November 11, 1887:
"<a   href="August_Spies.md" class="wikilink" title="August Spies">August

"<a   href="Adolph_Fischer.md" class="wikilink" title="Adolph Fischer">Adolph
Fischer</a>, and
"<a   href="George_Engel.md" class="wikilink" title="George Engel">George
Engel</a>.

On June 26, 1893, Illinois Governor
"<a   href="John_Peter_Altgeld.md" class="wikilink"
title="John Peter Altgeld">John Peter Altgeld</a> issued an
extraordinary pardon for the three surviving Haymarket
defendants—"<a   href="Oscar_Neebe.md" class="wikilink" title="Oscar Neebe">Oscar
Neebe</a>,
"<a   href="Michael_Schwab.md" class="wikilink" title="Michael Schwab">Michael
Schwab</a>, and
"<a   href="Samuel_Fielden.md" class="wikilink" title="Samuel Fielden">Samuel
Fielden</a>—declaring them innocent. In his pardon statement, Altgeld
indicated that Lingg and the four executed men were also innocent,
though they could not be formally pardoned posthumously.[^22]

The Haymarket affair and its judicial aftermath became a rallying point
for anarchists and labor militants worldwide. Lingg's courage, his
uncompromising principles, and his refusal to submit to state execution
made him an enduring symbol of revolutionary resistance. His final
statement to the court remains one of the most powerful articulations of
anarchist defiance of capitalist law and order.

The annual commemoration of May Day as
"<a   href="International_Workers&#39;_Day.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workers&#39; Day">International Workers' Day</a>
originated partly in memory of the Haymarket Martyrs and their struggle
for the eight-hour workday. Lingg's life and death exemplify the
anarchist understanding that the capitalist state will use any
means—perjured testimony, biased judges, manufactured evidence—to
suppress those who effectively challenge its authority.
