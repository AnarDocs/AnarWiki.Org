For roughly the fist 1.7 billion years of life on Earth consisted of
prokaryotes, nucleus-less cells grouped into bacteria and archea. Then 2
billion years, two prokaryotes symbiotically joined to form the more
complex *eukaryotic* cells that make up all animals, plants, and fungi.

Starting in the 1960s, the biologist Lynn Margulis did much to clarify
and make mainstream the theory of the symbiotic origin of
eukaryotes.[^1] Margulis writes with her co-author (and son) Dorion
Sagan, "The creative force of symbiosis produced eukaryotic cells from
<a href="Bacteria" class="wikilink" title="bacteria">bacteria</a>. Hence
all larger organisms--protocoists, fungi, animals, and
plants--originated symbiogenetically."[^2]

There are a number of reasons to believe that components of eukaryotic
cells originated as independent prokaryotes. The DNA of a eukaryote's
component parts, specifically, mitochondria and plastids, is unlike the
DNA of the nucleus. Mitochondria and plastids make proteins in ways that
prokaryotes do and are affected by drugs that affect prokaryotes. One
way that the symbiosis may have occurred is that the host cell may have
preyed on and digested the bacteria. A second way is that the host cell
and the bacteria may have lived side by side, producing substances for
each other, until the host took the other cell inside itself.[^3]

Science journalist David Quamm explains, "\[E\]xperts agree nowadays
that endosymbiosis played an essential role: somehow a bacterium got
captured and domesticated inside another cell, a host, where it became a
mitochondrion."[^4]

In 2015, however, a group of scientists led by Thijs Ettema proposed
that the host cell was a type of archea (not bacteria) they found at the
bottom of the Atlantic Ocean between Greenland and Norway. They called
the it *Lokiarchaeum* and found it to be closely related to
eukaryotes.[^5]

The evolution of eukaryotes involved epigenetic inheritance according to
Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb:

> Without reliable structural inheritance, the transition would not have
> been possible: the internal skeleton that was necessary after the
> prokaryotic cell was lost, the structural elements necessary for
> mitosis, and the construction of the membranes of the cell and its
> organelles, all depend on information transmitted through guided
> assembly.\<ref\>Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb, “The Evolution in the
