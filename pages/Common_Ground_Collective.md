After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, the government lost
control of the city and left thousands of residents to fend for
themselves. Dead body parts drifted through flooded streets, and
National Guard helicopters flew overhead not to rescue people but to
point machine guns down at the mostly black and low-income
population.[^1]

"Yet in this period of catastrophe," writes Peter Gelderloos, "with
hundreds of people dying and resources necessary for survival solely
limited, strangers came together to assist one another in a spirit of
mutual aid \[...\] In fact, the vast majority of rescues were carried
out not by police and professionals, but by common New Orleans
residents, often in defiance of the orders of authorities."[^2]

On 5 September 2005, Sharon Johnson and Malik Rahim, residents of the
city's neighborhood of Algiers, joined with the Texas-based organizer
scott crow to form the Common Ground Collective (CGC) dedicated to
empowering the local community and providing relief services that the
government had failed to provide. With Rahim being a former Black
Panther and crow an anarchist, the Collective's principles came to
reflect elements of both traditions. Common Ground picked up garbage,
prepared and served meals, ran health clinics, started free schools,
provided bicycles and trailers, planted community gardens, built
affordable housing, and launched worker cooperatives. Some 23,000
volunteers participated in the Collective's first three years. Common
Ground became, in crow's words, "the largest functioning organization
based on anarchist ideals in the United States since the IWW."[^3]

Common Ground's survival programs easily surpassed those offered by the
government and the Red Cross. "In Algiers, FEMA effectively became a
giant referral service to Common Ground Relief and other aid agencies,"
crow writes. When FEMA's regional head needed medical attention, she
chose to visit Common Ground's health clinic instead of the Red Cross or
military doctors. Upon leaving the clinic, she repeatedly said it was
the best medical service she'd seen in the region.[^4]

Projects were run by autonomous working groups that were accountable
both to the Collective and to the community members they served. Because
of state scrutiny, the health clinics were forced to adopt hierarchical
elements that other affinity groups could avoid. The Collective itself
had about 40 members. To join the Collective, a volunteer had to
establish a record in the community of work, commitment and
accountability. As a CGC communique explained, "\[W\]e don't have a
collective body that micro manages every detail either. The central
collective body works on long term goals, strategies, internal
organizing processes and finances with each project maintaining a great
amount of autonomy. Is it bureaucratic? Not even close, but it is
getting more tightly organized. We are setting up guidelines and
processes for the way we function so that we can continue to do so."[^5]

Some anarchists criticized Common Ground for not implementing anarchist
ideals consistently enough, for having leadership positions, and for not
immediately plugging all fresh volunteers into the Collective's central
decision-making roles. In response, a core CGC organizer Kerul Dyer
acknowledged, "Common Ground is a largely white activist organization,
and most of the coordinators come from an anti-authoritarian political
culture. Malik Rahim and some of the core leadership in NOLA, however,
come from a radical black political culture with fundamentally different
experiences and approaches. The organization incorporates many
decentralized characteristics, but at base we are acting in solidarity
with local black leadership, and Malik makes many of the final overall
long term decisions."[^6]

Around May 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigations began secretly
paying the CGC core organizer Brandon Darby. Having been reprimanded for
misogynist behavior, Darby left CGC on bad terms in 2006, but in 2007,
the Collective allowed him to return as interim director for almost
three months. As director, he acted in an authoritarian manner, removing
coordinators who challenged him, dropping programs without consulting
the community, and unaccountably handling funds. The Collective forced
him out, and crow alleges that Darby's decisions were part of an FBI
attempt to destroy the Collective.[^7]

In 2008, after more than two years of implementing anarchist practices,
CGC transitioned into a traditional nonprofit organization. crow
explains, "\[T\]here were more entrenched forces with greater resources
beyond us. Given the circumstances, it was almost inevitable that our
more radical elements would be co-opted, crushing the openings that we
had created, or that they would wither as the masses of volunteers moved
on.[^8]
