The Mapuche (meaning "people of the land"[^1]) are a group of
traditionally anti-authoritarian indigenous communities living in Chile
and Argentina. The Mapuche retained autonomy from the Inca Empire and
they successfully resisted Spanish colonization for nearly three
centuries. Today, Mapuche communities fight against land grabs by the
timber and hydroelectric industries. A list of Mapuche support
organizations can be found at: <https://www.mapuche-nation.org/links/>

When Spanish colonizers arrived in the sixteenth century, an estimated 1
million indigenous Mapuche lived in the territories now occupied by
Chile and Argentina. The Mapuche people were sedentary small farmers who
also hunted and gathered, subsisting largely on fish, potatoes and
beans. The Mapuche were organized into small familial clans or
communities, each with a *lonco*, or chief. Today, most loncos are men,
but some are women. Other leadership positions include the *maichi*, who
is a religious figure and healer, and the *weaken*, or spokesperson.
Traditionally, the clans also had a war leader. Each community manages
its land collectively and makes many of its decisions at a popular
assembly.[^2]

The Mapuche people's ancestral territory is called Wall-Mapu, Wall
meaning universe and Mapu meaning land. Their historic organizational
structure involved regions called *wixan-mapu* comprised of districts
called *ayllu-rewe* and autonomous each known as a *lof*.[^3]

Mapuche villages produced textiles from llama wool and engaged in
metalwork. They first encountered the Spanish in 1536, defeating them in
the Battle of Reynoguelen. During the First Great Mapuche Rebellion, in
1553, warriors chose Caupolican as their military commander, or *toki*.
He had been taken prisoner by the Spaniards and escaped in 1551 after
personally serving officer Pedro de Valdivia and learning Spanish
military techniques. Renamed Lautaro, he taught other Mapuche how to
ride horses. They won several battles and captured and executed
Valdivia. Eventually in 1558, the Mapuche pretended to surrender but
continued training for the Second Great Mapuche Rebellion launched in
1561. Mapuche women participated in the resistance. For instance,
Janequeo in 1590 led attacks against the Spanish including killing the
commander and much of the garrison of the fort of Puchanqui.

In 1598, the *toki* Pelantaru led a surprise attack attack on a camp of
Spanish and their Yanakuna allies in Curalaba, killing all but a two
Spaniards and a few Yanakuna. The successful raid inspired a Third Great
Mapuche Rebellion, involving around four thousand Mapuche warriors
against just 600 Spaniards. Led by the *toki* Paillamachu, the Mapuche
attacked Fort Valdivia and Spanish settlements. Over six years, Mapuche
warriors destroyed seven Spanish cities: Coya in 1599, Valdivia in 1599,
Los Infantes in 1599, Imperial in 1600, Villarica in 1602, Osorno in
1603, and Araucan in 1604.[^4] On 6 January 1641, the Mapuche and the
Spanish Empire signed the Treaty of Killin recognizing Mapuche
autonomy.[^5]

Unlike their neighboring, centralized indigenous nations, the Mapuche
escaped Spanish rule and remained autonomous for some 260 years, until
being conquered at the end of the nineteenth century by the state of
Chile. In fact, the Mapuche put the Spaniards on the defensive in 1598
and destroyed all of the Spanish cities south of the Bio-Bio region. The
historian José Bengoa attributes the Mapuche's successful resistance to
their decentralized structure:

> in contrast to the Aztecs, who had centralized governments and
> internal political divisions, the Mapuche had a non-hierarchical
> social structure. In the Mexican and Andean cases the conquerors
> struck at the heart of political power and, by seizing it, assured the
> dominance of the empire. This was not possible with the Mapuche, given
> that subjugation would entail conquering thousands of independent
> families[^6]

# Mapuche Struggles today

Today, the Mapuche struggle against devastating land grabs from the
timber and hydroelectric industries. 1 million Mapuche live in Chile, 40
percent of them in the city of Santiago. Mapuche groups have used
strikes, road blockades and arson, in order to resist the theft of their
land. The Chilean government responds with the the sharp criminalization
and repression of Mapuche "terrorism".[^7]

An agricultural consortium estimated that in the five years prior to
2004, Mapuche rebels launched over 600 attacks and private estates and
forestry companies suffered over 1 billion pesos in damages.[^8]

Mapuche autonomous communities practice horizontal organization,
communal land ownership, and collective agriculture. Numerous autonomous
Mapuche villages have achieved food sovereignty.[^9]
