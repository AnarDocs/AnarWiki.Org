### Notes

- Success of open source projects (arguably the most successful examples
  of working communism at scale in history) rely on free association and
  distributed projects
- Elinor Ostrom’s work on common pool resources show thoroughly that
  bottom-up approaches of consensus and agreement are what allow such
  approaches to work. While not explicitly socialist, her work does show
  people overcoming the tragedy of the commons (which is a common
  argument against socialism) for a long time, sometimes *hundreds* of
  years.
- USSR was playing catch-up utilizing technology developed under
  capitalism. Growth rates tapered off as its industry matured. Failed
  to develop an internet because of infighting.
- Censorship of science under the USSR: most obvious fields that were
  suppressed were genetics, cybernetics and physics. USSR also censored
  photocopier which made communication difficult because they feared
  uprising
- Stafford Beer’s Cybersyn was built using cybernetic principles and
  rejected centralized planning so the system could be more adaptive
- 20th century "communist" regimes all failed miserably and at best,
  were little better than colonial capitalism. In their wake they left
  deeply reactionary societies and their ruling elites flipped to
  fascists almost overnight
- Nation-states’ military doctrines, often based on vertical command
  structure, are slow to respond to decentralised warfare by non-state
  actors
