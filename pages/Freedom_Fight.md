Freedom Fight is "an anarchist, alter-globalist movement created in
Serbia in 2003." It runs a news website at www.freedomfight.net. In a
February 2007 interview with Andrej Grubacic, Freedom Fight members
criticized Yugoslavian state-capitalism:

> In reality, that so-called self-management system was controlled and
> coordinated by political bureaucracy and I think it is wrong to even
> call it self-management. It was certainly not a classless system and
> there certainly were authoritarian decision making. However, even
> self-management with those malfunctions was a much better system than
> \[neoliberalism\].[^1]
