Rebelling against bureaucratic city-states, early Israelites established
a tribal, pastoral society that, while patriarchal and theologically
repressive, resisted statehood for about three hundred years until they
established a loose monarchy in the tenth century BCE. “These early
Israelites had no temple, no city, no king,” writes Catholic
Worker-affiliated theologian Laurel Dyksta.[^1] Citizens' councils and
assemblies were aspects of Israelites' government.[^2] Even during the
monarchy period, the Jubilee practice placed limits on the accumulation
of economic power. Communistic currents during this period included the

prophetic countercultures including

The name "Israel" means "to struggle with God." It comes from the story
in Genesis 32:22–32 where Jacob wrestles with an angel, wins, and
acquires the name Israel as a result.[^3]

# History

A monument erected by the pharaoh Mernaptha reports that the Israelites
emerged as a distinct nation by 1220 BCE.[^4]

Scholars now widely agree that the early Israelites were primarily
indigenous Canaanites.[^5] The Marxist sociologist and Biblical scholar
Norman Gottwald pioneered this theory in the 1970s and 1980s, arguing
that the 1200 BCE Israelite settlements were "looking very much like
Canaanites and diverging from them in a new religion and a new kind of
social organization."[^6] For example, "The Hebrew language appears to
have been a dialect of the Canaanite language. It was apparently the
dialect of the underclass Canaanites."[^7] Mark Smith elaborates the
evidence of the link between Canaanite and Israelite culture:

> “Early Israelite culture cannot be separated easily from the culture
> of ‘Canaan.’ The highlands of Israel in the Iron Age (ca. 1200-587)
> reflect continutiy with the ‘Canaanite’ (or better, West Semitic)
> culture during the proceding period both in the highlands ad in the
> contemporary cities on the coast and in the valleys. This continuity
> is reflected in scripts, for one example \[…\] Canaanite and Hebrew so
> closley overlap tha the ability to distinguish them is premised more
> on historical information than linguistic criteria \[…\] Similarly,
> Canaanite and Israelite material culture cannot be distinguished by
> specific features in the judges period. For example, some Iron I (ca.
> 1200-1000) cooking pots and storage jars as attested at Giloh
> represent a pottery tradition continuous with the Late Bronze Age.
> Items such as the four-room house, collared-rim store jar, and hewn
> cisterns, once thought to distinguish the Israelite culture of the
> highlands from the Canaanite culture of the coast and valleys, are now
> attested on the coast, in the valleys, or in Transjordan.”[^8]

The Old Testament account of the Exodus, while perhaps containing a
small degree of truth, is mainly contradicted by the archeological
record. Gottwald acknowledges "it's very probable" that a group of
Israelites did come from Egypt.[^9] However, they were likely a
minority. Cities said to have been destroyed by the Israelites were
actually destroyed long before the Israelites are said to have arrived
in Canaan. There is no evidence that Israelites were in Egypt, or that
masses of slaves left Egypt.

Gottwald writes, “All the evidence for early Israel points to its
tribalism as a self-constructed instrument of resistance and of
decentralized self-rule”.[^10]

# Structure and Culture

Early Israelites had no taxes, no rent, and no interest. People had
“approximately equal access”[^11] to basic resources. Israel had “no
specialized political offices.”[^12] Israel's rallying cry was "We have
no king but Yahweh."[^13] Political structures included extended
families and their protective associations called mispahot, a citizen
army, the ritual congregation, the landless Levite priests, and the
Rechabite metal specialists.[^14]

According to the Book of Judges (21:25), "In those days there was no
king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes."

Peter Gelderloos notes the decentralization of the ancient Israelites
even during the monarchy period:

> Contrary to the exaggerations in the Bible, the United Kingdom of
> Israel was not a state, and the level of unification it achieved was
> minimal, limited to the battlefield and a few acts of temple
> construction, the most famous being in Jerusalem, a city that at the
> time only had a few hundred inhabitants. Perhaps only the last of the
> three supposed kings—Saul, David, and Solomon—actually exercised a
> leadership role over the whole of the confederation. Significantly,
> the conquest story of the origins of Israel was made up a couple
> centuries later by state historians who wanted to invent a militarist
> pedigree in which the country was founded on the slaughter of
> heathens. Archaeological evidence shows that in reality, the
> Israelites and the Canaanites peacefully coexisted.
>
> The northern tribal confederation of Israel, which contained the
> majority of the Israelite tribes, rejected Solomon’s attempt to found
> a dynasty, so that his son only had authority in the smaller, southern
> Kingdom of Judah. Politogenesis actually occurred over the following
> century, as the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel fought each
> other and also waged wars against the Moabites, the Assyrians, the
> Egyptians, and the neo-Babylonians. The Old Testament reflects the
> Kingdom of Judah’s disdain for Israel’s tolerance of polytheism, and
> documents Judah’s use of monotheism to legitimate the role of a
> supreme monarch supported by a priestly class. The Kingdom of Israel
> promoted polytheism—particularly the worship of the Phoenician god
> Baal—partly as a way to prevent their religious-cultural domination by
> Jerusalem (the capital of Judah) and partly as a reflection of their
> greater tolerance (or weaker control by a priestly class). Though the
> northern kingdom was more populous and architecturally more advanced,
> it can be argued that they did not develop into a state until later,
> under the Omrides dynasty.[^15]

The Biblical Jubilee decrees that debt be forgiven every seven years.
Evidence suggests that the Jubilee was followed in practice.[^16]

Although the Hebrew Bible contains many instances of clear misogyny, the
text was written by elite urban men and largely described earlier
periods of Israelite society. Voicing what seems to be a minority
viewpoint, classicist Carol Meyers argues that ancient Israel was not a
patriarchal society. Because of the indispensability of the women's
labor of cooking, sewing and tool-making, it's likely that women
exercised managerial power in the household and would have been
decision-making partners with the men. Meyers notes that the Bible
portrays women prominent public positions including as judges, sages,
mourners, and performers.[^17]

Archeologists have found that some ancient Israelites burned cannibas
during worship at a sanctuary in Tel Arad.[^18]

By the time of the monarchy, if not earlier, the Israelites' theology
replaced animistic tribalism with a belief in an anthropomorphic God who
transcended nature. Murray Bookchin argues that their fear of God
"provided an ideology of unreasoned obedience, of rule by fiat and the
powers of supernatural retribution."[^19]

## Multiple Genders

There were several recognized genders in ancient Israel.

> Zachar: male
>
> Nekevah: female
>
> Androgynos: someone with both male and female genitalia
>
> Tumtum: someone with indeterminate or obscured genitalia
>
> Ay’lonit: someone born female who develops male characteristics
>
> Saris: someone born male who develops female characteristics[^20]

# Dissidents and Prophets

After the establishment of the monarchy, some Israelites practiced
egalitarian living. Notably, the
<a href="Essenes.md" class="wikilink" title="Essenes">Essenes</a> were a
communistic (and perhaps vegetarian) Jewish order.

Hebrew prophets often tried to bring back the early, egalitarian
impulses of the early Israelite culture. For example, Isaiah demands of
Israel's leaders, "What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding
the faces of the poor?"[^21]

Among the <a href="Early_Christians.md" class="wikilink"
title="Early Christians">Early Christians</a>, according to Erich Fromm,
"there was not even a clearly defined external authority" and there
existed protection of "the independence and freedom of the individual
Christian with respect to matters of faith." The first Christians, Fromm
argues, "were imbued with hatred and contempt for the educated rich and
rulers, in short for all authority."[^22]
