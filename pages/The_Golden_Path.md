A/Acc (Anarchy Accelerator)

This is a blueprint on how to create a free, open, collaborative
workspace where we chart course into a brighter tomorrow.

Building on an understanding of how we got here and where we want to be;
focused on building and consolidating culturally aligned groups,
organizations, and projects with the intention to accelerate efforts
toward our shared goal.

Written within this blueprint you will see a way for every person to be
of immeasurable value, regardless of ability. With a *day/moment* by
*day/moment* approach, the path is always focused on meeting the needs
of now, with an eye on simplifying the process for tomorrow.
