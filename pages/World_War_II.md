## History of the War

### Background

The seeds of World War II were sown by the impact of

across Europe (notably in
"<a   href="February_Uprising_(Austria).md" class="wikilink"
title="Austria">"Austria</a>, Spain, Portugal and Hungary) led to the
creation of several mutually-hostile and militaristic governments.

The Great Depression and several other events in
"<a   href="Japanese_Empire.md" class="wikilink" title="Japan">"Japan</a> led
to the decline of the power of the democratic wings of government and
concentration of power in the military. Becoming increasingly cut off
from global trade as a result of higher tariffs and drying up
international credit, Japan formed an alliance with Nazi Germany and
Fascist Italy as they began to conquer surrounding territories for more
resources. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 (notably destroying the
"<a   href="Shinmin_Autonomous_Zone.md" class="wikilink"
title="Shinmin Zone">"Shinmin Zone</a>) in order to secure more natural
resources. Italy invaded Ethiopia and Nazi Germany annexed Austria and
invaded Czechoslovakia.

All states exercised a desire for self-sufficiency, with the Japanese
planning to create a greater sphere of influence and puppet states in
Asia and the Pacific Region, Italy desired to rebuild the
"<a   href="Roman_Empire.md" class="wikilink" title="Roman Empire">"Roman
Empire</a> and reconquer much of Southern Europe and Northern Africa and
Germany desired to create an entirely

### 1937

One of the first proposed dates for the beginning of World War II was
the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War as Japan attempted to take
control of China but quickly got bogged down in a lengthy guerrilla war.
The war was extremely brutal, with so of the most horrific crimes in
history being committed by both sides.

### 1938

### 1939

1939 is the most commonly proposed date for the start of the war with
the USSR and Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland and subsequent
declaration of war by the British and French Empires against Germany
(but not the USSR). Although this led to the infamous 'Phony War' where
France and Britain did not launch a major attack against Nazi Germany
with disastrous consequences. The USSR also began to pressure Estonia
into granting it access for Soviet soldiers and aircraft and soon
attempted to invade Finland, leading to the Winter War where liberal
democratic Finland allied with Nazi Germany and was able to fend off the
USSRs invasion.

### 1940

Britain and Germany both invade Norway in attempt to take control of
Scandinavia, Germany wins (also taking Denmark) and Finland drives out
the USSR. Germany manages to quickly invade Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and France (although much of the French Empire remains
intact). The UK invades Iceland and the USSR annexes Estonia, Lithuania,
Latvia and Moldova.

### 1941

Italy manages to take Somalia off Britain and launches a disastrous
invasion of Greece. Germany steps in to help Italy in Greece. Germany
forms alliances with Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria and invades
Yugoslavia. French colonies enter a civil war as Iraq and Syria are
taken back by the allies. Conflict begins in North Africa between
Italian Libya and British Egypt. Britain manages to end Italy's
occupation of Ethiopia and Somalia and Germany begins an (initially)
highly successful invasion of the USSR.

Germany begins massive bombing raids against the UK and Ireland and the
UK retaliates.

Near the end of the year, Germany begins an invasion of the USSR and
Japan bombs a US navy base in Hawaii, leading to the entry of the US and
USSR into the war, which is arguably the greatest mistake made by
Germany and Japan.

### 1942

### 1943

### 1944

### 1945

Germany loses control of France and Poland and is squeezed between two
massive military powers, some of the most intense fighting of the war
occurs until Soviet soldiers are in sight of Berlin, leading to many
senior Nazi scientists and officers escaping (often to South America,

## Effects

World War II completely changed the world, the geopolitical balance of
power, economics, political philosophy and technology.

#### Decolonisation

World War II crippled the British, French and Dutch Empires by
destroying the 'home'/core regions of power and inspiring a

anti-colonial revolts and movements</a> (Notably in India, Indonesia,
Vietnam and Africa) Many in the colonies were inspired by the democratic
and anti-fascist ideals of the allies and were angered that it was not
extended to them.

#### Economic Boom

Following World War II, there was a notable and giant economic boom in
Western Europe, North America and Japan. This also coincided with a
massive boost in technology and the availability of consumer goods.
