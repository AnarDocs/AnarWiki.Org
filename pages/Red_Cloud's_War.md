> Even more impressive than the example provided by the Makhnovists is
> the victory won by several indigenous nations in 1868. In a two year
> war, thousands of warriors from the Lakota and Cheyenne nations
> defeated the US military and destroyed several army forts during what
> became known as Red Cloud’s War. In 1866, the Lakota met with the US
> government at Fort Laramie because the latter wanted permission to
> build a military trail through the Powder River country to facilitate
> the influx of white settlers who were seeking gold. The US military
> had already defeated the Arapaho in its attempt to open the area for
> white settlers, but they had been unable to defeat the Lakota. During
> the negotiations it became apparent that the US government had already
> started the process of building military forts along this trail,
> without even having secured permission for the trail itself. The
> Oglala Lakota war chief Red Cloud promised to resist any white
> attempts to occupy the area. Nonetheless in the summer of 1866 the US
> military began sending more troops to the region and constructing new
> forts. Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors following the direction
> of Red Cloud began a campaign of guerrilla resistance, effectively
> closing down the Bozeman trail and harassing the troops stationed in
> the forts. The military sent down the order for an aggressive winter
> campaign, and on December 21, when their wood train was attacked yet
> again, an army of about one hundred US soldiers decided to pursue.
> They met a decoy party including the Oglala warrior Crazy Horse and
> took the bait. The entire force was defeated and killed by a force of
> 1,000–3,000 warriors that waited in ambush. The commanding officer of
> the white soldiers was knifed to death in hand to hand combat. The
> Lakota left a young bugle boy who fought with just his bugle covered
> in a buffalo robe as a sign of honor — with such acts the indigenous
> warriors demonstrated the possibility of a much more respectful form
> of warfare, in contrast with the white soldiers and settlers who often
> cut out fetuses from pregnant women and used the amputated genitals of
> unarmed victims as tobacco pouches.
>
> In the summer of 1867 US troops with new repeating rifles fought the
> Lakota to a standstill in two battles, but they failed to carry out
> any successful offensives. In the end, they asked for peace talks,
> which Red Cloud said he would only grant if the new military forts
> were abandoned. The US government agreed, and in the peace talks they
> recognized the rights of the Lakota to the Black Hills and Powder
> River country, a huge area currently occupied by the states of North
> Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana.
>
> During the war, the Lakota and Cheyenne organized without coercion or
> military discipline. But contrary to the typical dichotomies, their
> relative lack of hierarchy did not hamper their ability for
> organization. On the contrary, they held together during a brutal war
> on the basis of a collective, self-motivated discipline and varying
> forms of organization. In a Western army, the most important unit is
> the military police or the officer who walks behind the troops, pistol
> loaded and ready to shoot anyone who turns and runs. The Lakota and
> Cheyenne had no need for discipline imposed from above. They were
> fighting to defend their land and way of life, in groups bound by
> kinship and affinity.
>
> Some fighting groups were structured with a chain of command, while
> others operated in a more collective fashion, but all of them
> voluntarily rallied around individuals with the best organizational
> abilities, spiritual power, and combat experience. These war chiefs
> did not control those who followed them so much as inspire them. When
> morale was low or a fight looked hopeless, groups of warriors often
> went home, and they were always free to do so. If a chief declared
> war, he had to go, but no one else did, so a leader who could not
> convince anyone to follow him to war was engaging in an embarrassing
> and even suicidal venture. In contrast, politicians and generals in
> Western society frequently start unpopular wars, and they are never
> the ones to suffer the consequences.
>
> The warrior societies played an important role in the indigenous
> organization of warfare, but women’s societies were vital as well.
> They played a role similar to that of the Quartermaster in Western
> armies, provisioning food and materials, except that where the
> Quartermaster is a simple cog obeying orders, the Lakota and Cheyenne
> women would refuse to cooperate if they disagreed with the reasons for
> a war. Considering that one of Napoleon’s most important contributions
> to European warfare was the insight that “an army marches on its
> stomach,” it becomes apparent that Lakota and Cheyenne women exercised
> more power in the affairs of their nations than the histories written
> by men and white people would lead us to believe. Additionally, women
> who chose to could fight alongside the men.
>
> Despite being impossibly outnumbered by the US military and white
> settler paramilitaries, the Native Americans won. After Red Cloud’s
> War, the Lakota and Cheyenne enjoyed nearly a decade of autonomy and
> peace. Contrary to pacifist allegations about militant resistance, the
> victors did not begin oppressing one another or creating
> uncontrollable cycles of violence just because they had violently
> fought off the white invaders. They won themselves several years of
> freedom and peace.
>
> In 1876, the US military again invaded the Lakota territory to attempt
> to force them to live on the reservations, which were being
> transformed into concentration camps as part of the campaign of
> genocide against the indigenous populations. Several thousand troops
> were involved, and they met with several early defeats, the most
> notable of which was the Battle of Greasy Grass Creek, also known as
> the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Around 1,000 Lakota and Cheyenne
> warriors, defending themselves from an attack, decimated the cavalry
> unit commanded by George A. Custer and killed several hundred
> soldiers. Custer himself had previously invaded Lakota lands to spread
> reports of gold and provoke another wave of white settlers, who were a
> major driving force for the genocide. The settlers, aside from being
> an armed paramilitary force responsible for a large share of the
> encroachments and murders, provided a sufficient pretext for bringing
> in the military. The logic was that those poor humble homesteaders, in
> the act of invading another country, had to be defended from
> “marauding Indians.” The US government ultimately won the war against
> the Lakota, by attacking their villages, invading their hunting
> grounds, and instituting strong repression against the people living
> on the reservations. One of the last to surrender was the Oglala
> warrior Crazy Horse, who had been one of the most effective leaders in
> the fight against the US military. After his group agreed to come into
> the reservation, Crazy Horse was arrested and assassinated.
>
> Their ultimate defeat does not indicate a weakness in the horizontal
> organization of the Lakota and Cheyenne so much as the fact that the
> white American population trying to exterminate them outnumbered these
> indigenous groups by a thousand to one, and had the ability to spread
> disease and drug addiction on their home turf while destroying their
> food source.
