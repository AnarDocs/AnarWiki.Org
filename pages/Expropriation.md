# Expropriation

**Expropriation** is the revolutionary act of reclaiming property,
resources, and means of production from capitalists and returning them
to common ownership and use by the working class and communities. From
an anarchist perspective, expropriation is not theft but rather the
recuperation of wealth that has been illegitimately accumulated through
exploitation, dispossession, and violence against the working class.

## Overview

Expropriation represents the practical application of the anarchist
critique of <a href="private_property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a>. As
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> famously
declared, "property is theft,"[^1] establishing the philosophical
foundation that the wealth controlled by landowners, capitalists, and
the state has been stolen from those who produce it. Expropriation is
therefore understood as a defensive and just action - the taking back of
what rightfully belongs to the commons.

<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> articulated the necessity of expropriation in **The
Conquest of Bread**, arguing that revolutionary change requires "the
expropriation of all that enables any man to appropriate the product of
others' toil."[^2] He emphasized that expropriation must be total and
immediate, as partial measures would fail to address the fundamental
injustices of capitalism and would leave the revolutionary movement
vulnerable to counter-revolution.

The anarchist understanding distinguishes expropriation from mere
redistribution or state seizure. Unlike
<a href="authoritarian_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian socialism">authoritarian socialism</a>, which
transfers property to state control, anarchist expropriation aims to
abolish property relations entirely, placing resources under the direct,
decentralized control of workers and communities organized through
voluntary association.

## Philosophical Foundations

### Property as Violence

The anarchist case for expropriation rests on the understanding that
private property - particularly in land and means of production -
constitutes violence against humanity.
<a href="Errico_Malatesta" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> wrote, "To destroy
radically this oppression without any danger of it reemerging, all
people must be convinced of their right to the means of production, and
be prepared to exercise this basic right by expropriating the
landowners, the industrialists and financiers."[^3]

This violence operates through multiple mechanisms:

- Denying people access to the means of survival and production
- Forcing workers to sell their labor power to survive
- Concentrating wealth through the exploitation of labor
- Using state force to maintain property relations

<a href="Louisa_Sarah_Bevington" class="wikilink"
title="Louisa Sarah Bevington">Louisa Sarah Bevington</a> argued that
property holding itself is inherently oppressive: "Property is
government. Property - that is, the prohibitive custody by particular
persons of any part of the general resources - cannot be shown to have
any value at all for any one, merely as 'owner,' except the power it
gives him over the faculties and liberties of his fellow-creatures."[^4]

### Illegitimate Accumulation

Anarchist analysis emphasizes that virtually all concentrated wealth has
been accumulated through illegitimate means including:

- Violent seizure of common lands through
  <a href="enclosure" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">enclosure</a>
- <a href="Slavery" class="wikilink" title="Slavery">Slavery</a> and
  forced labor
- Colonial theft and genocide
- Exploitation of wage labor
- Fraud and financial manipulation
- State-enforced monopolies

As one modern analysis states, "Nearly all of our problems are rooted in
the massively unequal ownership of land, wealth, and power that exists
among the over-7 billion human beings on earth. This predicament did not
happen overnight, and it is far from natural. Rather, it is the product
of centuries of immoral, illegitimate, and unwarranted human activity
carried out by a miniscule section of the world's people."[^5]

## Historical Practice

### Early Anarchist Expropriation

Throughout anarchist history, expropriation has taken various forms,
from individual acts to mass collective seizures.

**Individual and Group Actions:** Many anarchists engaged in what was
called "expropriative anarchism" - bank robberies, counterfeiting, and
other forms of direct seizure of capitalist wealth to fund revolutionary
activity. Groups like **Los Solidarios** in Spain (1922-1924) became
famous for bank expropriations, with
<a href="Buenaventura_Durruti" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a> and
<a href="Francisco_Ascaso" class="wikilink"
title="Francisco Ascaso">Francisco Ascaso</a> conducting numerous
operations in Chile, Argentina, and Spain.[^6]

Italian anarchist <a href="Severino_Di_Giovanni" class="wikilink"
title="Severino Di Giovanni">Severino Di Giovanni</a> stormed the Obras
Sanitarias de la Nación in 1930, taking 286,000 pesos to fund attempts
to free imprisoned comrades.
<a href="Lucio_Urtubia" class="wikilink" title="Lucio Urtubia">Lucio
Urtubia</a> forged thousands of Citibank traveler's checks in 1977 to
fund revolutionary groups including the Black Panther Party.[^7]

### Spanish Revolution

The most extensive example of anarchist expropriation occurred during
the <a href="Spanish_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> of 1936-1939. Millions
of workers and peasants, organized primarily through the
anarcho-syndicalist
<a href="CNT-FAI" class="wikilink" title="CNT-FAI">CNT-FAI</a>,
expropriated land, factories, and resources across eastern Spain.

In Catalonia, all industry and public services were collectivized
between 1936-1937. At least 1,600 agricultural collectives involving
over 400,000 people functioned in Aragon, the Levant, and Castile.[^8]
These expropriations were carried out through direct action by workers'
organizations, not state decree.

As documented by observers, "The fishing industry was socialised by the
CNT and UGT Seamen's Unions. The whole fishing fleet was expropriated.
The shipowners fled. Economic inequalities were abolished. No longer did
the shipowners and their agents appropriate the lion's share of the
income."[^9]

The collectives demonstrated that expropriation could lead to improved
productivity and living conditions. In Fraga, the collective comprised
700 families and undertook extensive public works while providing for
224 refugees. Medical care was collectivized, hospitals expanded, and
public hygiene dramatically improved.[^10]

### Notable Examples

From "A History of Expropriative Anarchism"[^11]

#### Armed Expropriative Groups and Individuals

**Rewolucyjni Mściciele (Revolutionary Avengers)** (1910-1914, Poland)
was a guerrilla militant anarchist group who early adopted expropriation
into their philosophy and operation. They have been called one of the
most extreme militant groups in Polish history.

**Los Solidarios** (1922-1924, Spain) was one of the earliest
expropriative anarchist groups, famous for the Bank of Spain Robbery in
September 1923. They were dubbed "the kings of Barcelona's workers
pistol."

**<a href="Buenaventura_Durruti" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a>** (1896-1936,
Spain), the legend of Revolutionary Catalonia, began his revolutionary
career in bank robbery, carrying out expropriations in Chile and
Argentina before returning to Spain.

**<a href="Francisco_Ascaso" class="wikilink"
title="Francisco Ascaso">Francisco Ascaso</a>** (1901-1936, Spain) was a
member of Los Solidarios and a companion of Durruti during their years
as bank robbers and in their final days in Catalonia.

**<a href="Severino_Di_Giovanni" class="wikilink"
title="Severino Di Giovanni">Severino Di Giovanni</a>** (1901-1931,
Italy/Argentina) played an important role in solidarity for the trial of
Sacco and Vanzetti. He planned the bombing of Mussolini's secret police.
In October 1930, he stormed the Obras Sanitarias de la Nación and took
286,000 pesos to fund plans to free his comrade Alejandro Scarfó.

**Miguel Arcángel Roscigna** (1891-1936, Argentina) was a blacksmith and
militant Italian anarchist who was active in Argentina's expropriative
scene.

**<a href="Lucio_Urtubia" class="wikilink" title="Lucio Urtubia">Lucio
Urtubia</a>** (1931-2020, Spain) is among the most well-known
expropriative anarchists in history, with records of bank robbery,
resistance and forgery. He forged thousands of Citibank traveler's
checks in 1977 to fund revolutionary groups like the Black Panther
Party. His trusty companion was an M1921 Thompson submachine gun in bank
heists, left to him by Quico Sabaté.

#### Digital Expropriation

**Phineas Fisher/Hack Back** (2019, unknown location) is a mysterious
hacker who identified as a revolutionary anarchist. They conducted hacks
on FinFisher, Hacking Team, AKP, Mossos d'Esquadra, and notably the
Cayman National Bank and Trust, where they withdrew thousands of dollars
and used it for hacktivist bug bounties. The first bounty was given to
the person behind MilicoLeaks, a hack on the Chilean military.

**Tillie Kottmann** (deletescape/tillie crimew) (2021, Switzerland)
hacked the security company Verkada and leaked data including prison
footage from 150,000 cameras. They were also behind source code hacks
that dumped hundreds of proprietary data sets from major corporations.

**Paige Adele Thompson** (netcrave) (2019, US) was behind the hack of
Capital One that leaked 100 million customer records.

**Jeremy Hammond** (Sup_g/Anarchaos) (2011, US), former LulzSec member,
conducted the Stratfor hack. After taking the data and wiping their
server, the group took thousands of credit cards and donated the money
to charity.

**Crackas With Attitude** (2015, international) was a group of
hacktivists who specialized in social engineering and used it to access
the personal emails of CIA director John Brennan, DNI director James
Clapper, and thousands of FBI employees.

**Phish Architect** (2020, unknown location) was an anarchist who leaked
property management and realtor targets such as Proptiger, DirectHomes,
and Remax.

**Walter Delgatti Neto** (2020, Brazil) was a social engineer who
exploited Telegram's security flaws to infiltrate and dump all data from
Bolsonaro's group chat.

#### Non-Anarchist Expropriative Actions

**Blekingegade Gang** (1972-1989, Denmark) was a Marxist militant
working group and bank robbers behind high-profile money truck heists in
Denmark to fund revolutionary groups like PFLP, Black Panther Party,
Liberation Support Movement, FRELIMO, and MPLA. They also broke into a
Swedish armory and took weapons and munitions, planning to smuggle them
to the PFLP.

**Papas Fritas** (2014, Chile) was an artist who broke into a defunct
university's vault to take \$500 million worth of student debts and
burned them all in public.

## Forms of Expropriation

### Syndicalist Strategy

<a href="Anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a> places expropriation
of the means of production at the core of its revolutionary strategy.
Through workplace organization, syndicalists aim to seize control of
production directly from capitalists through strikes, occupations, and
direct takeover.

Gregori Maximov explained: "In manufacturing and in some branches of the
primary industries, capitalism has thus already prepared the ground for
Communism and the syndicalisation of industry by the expropriation of
capitalists and the State."[^12]

The syndicalist approach emphasizes:

- Organization of workers at the point of production
- Building dual power structures capable of managing expropriated
  industries
- Defense of expropriated property through workers' militias
- Horizontal coordination between expropriated workplaces

### Insurrectionist Strategy

<a href="Insurrectionary_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Insurrectionary anarchism">Insurrectionary anarchism</a>
approaches expropriation through more immediate and spontaneous means,
emphasizing individual and small group actions that attack capitalist
property directly.

<a href="Luigi_Galleani" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Galleani">Luigi
Galleani</a> argued: "The anarchists, like the socialists, want and urge
the expropriation of the bourgeoisie, but they do not hope at all for
its generosity nor its philanthropy and justice. Confronted with the
violent pressure of the masses trying to overthrow it, the bourgeoisie
throws out each day a little of its ballast."[^13]

Insurrectionist expropriation includes:

- Armed robberies of banks and capitalist institutions
- Occupation of unused buildings and land
- Destruction or seizure of instruments of oppression
- Individual acts of recuperation

### Modern Applications

Contemporary anarchist movements continue traditions of expropriation
adapted to current conditions:

**Squatting:** The occupation of unused buildings and land represents
expropriation of real estate capital. With 22 empty houses for every
homeless person in the United States, squatting movements reclaim
housing for community use.[^14]

**Guerrilla Gardening:** The cultivation of food on unused or abandoned
property expropriates land from real estate speculation and returns it
to productive use for community sustenance.

**Shoplifting and Workplace Theft:** Individual recuperation of goods
from capitalist enterprises, while small-scale, represents the principle
that workers are entitled to reclaim what has been produced through
exploitation of their labor.

**Digital Expropriation:** Modern hacktivists like "Phineas Fisher" have
expropriated digital resources and funds from capitalist institutions,
donating proceeds to revolutionary causes. The hack of Cayman National
Bank and Trust withdrew thousands of dollars for hacktivist bug
bounties.[^15]

**Solidarity Networks:** These organizations combine mutual aid with
direct action to defend against evictions and wage theft, protecting
expropriated resources and supporting those who engage in recuperation.

## Relationship to Property

### Critique of Property Rights

Anarchist theory fundamentally rejects the concept of property rights as
legitimate. Bevington argued that "no true, nature-based title to
property as merely such can be shown to exist" and that the labor theory
of property is itself a delusion.[^16]

The distinction is made between:

- **Personal property** - items for direct personal use and possession
- **Private property** - property used to exploit others' labor or deny
  access to resources

Expropriation targets private property, particularly:

- Land held for rent or speculation
- Factories and means of production
- Financial capital and debt instruments
- Resources extracted from nature
- Infrastructure and communication systems

### Beyond Redistribution

Anarchist expropriation differs fundamentally from state-managed
redistribution or nationalization:

"I advocate and I look forward to wholesale expropriation because I do
not believe there is any such thing as a right to property, and because
I hold that it is disastrous, nay, fatal, to the welfare of all
individuals composing the community, to have to regulate their lives and
affairs in accordance with a fictitious abstraction which has no warrant
and no basis in the natural laws of life."[^17]

The goal is not to transfer ownership but to abolish the property
relation itself, replacing it with free access to resources based on
need and voluntary cooperation.

## Stages of Expropriation

Kropotkin and others emphasized that expropriation must be comprehensive
to avoid exhausting itself in "half measures."[^18] Modern anarchist
analysis identifies stages:

**Initial Seizure:** The direct taking of property from capitalist
control through occupation, appropriation, or force.

**Defense:** Organizing to resist attempts at eviction or
reprivatization through mutual aid networks, armed defense, and
community solidarity.

**Reorganization:** Transforming expropriated resources from instruments
of exploitation to tools of communal production and distribution.

**Generalization:** Spreading expropriation across sectors and regions
until private property relations are abolished entirely.

**Final Stage:** Reached when property "no longer needs defense from
counter-revolution or reaction" because the social relations that
enabled private property have been destroyed.[^19]

## Moral and Practical Justifications

### Self-Defense

Anarchists frame expropriation as fundamentally defensive - protecting
human life and dignity against the violence of property relations. If
private property is violence, then expropriation is resistance to that
violence.

### Natural Right

Some anarchists argue for natural rights to the commons: "There is one
right which man is generally thought to possess, which I am confident he
neither does nor can possess—a right to subsistence when his labor will
not fairly purchase it. Our law indeed recognizes no such right."[^20]

Anarchists invert this logic: humans have natural rights to the means of
subsistence, and property laws that deny this are illegitimate.

### Historical Justice

Given that concentrated wealth derives from historical crimes - slavery,
colonialism, enclosure, exploitation - expropriation represents a form
of reparative justice: "Expropriation is not theft. It is not the
confiscation of 'hard-earned' money. It is not the stealing of private
property. It is, rather, the recuperation of massive amounts of land and
wealth that have been built on the back of stolen natural resources,
human enslavement, and coerced labor."[^21]

### Revolutionary Necessity

Malatesta argued that capitalism cannot be reformed away: "It is quite
another matter when a man denied the means of working robs in order that
he or his family shall not die of hunger. In such a case, theft (if it
can thus be called) is a revolt against social injustice."[^22]

## Contemporary Relevance

Modern conditions of extreme inequality and ecological crisis have
renewed anarchist emphasis on expropriation. With global wealth
inequality at historic levels and the climate emergency demanding rapid
transformation of production, anarchists argue that expropriation is
both more necessary and more feasible than ever.

Contemporary anarchist strategy recognizes that "we cannot win by
playing by the rules of the ruling class, or by appealing to their
morality. The Anarchist strategy around housing (known by many as
squatting) and also urban gardening on unused/abandoned property
(guerrilla gardening) are very good examples of resource
expropriation."[^23]

The integration of expropriation with mutual aid projects demonstrates
how anarchists can build alternative systems while simultaneously
attacking capitalist property relations.

## Criticism

### From the Right

Defenders of capitalism argue that expropriation violates property
rights and individual liberty. Anarchists respond that property itself
is the violation of liberty, and that freedom from domination requires
the abolition of property relations.

### From Authoritarian Socialists

Marxist-Leninists criticize anarchist expropriation as "blanquism" or
adventurism, arguing that only state power can successfully seize and
hold productive forces. Anarchists counter that state seizure merely
replaces one exploiting class with another, and that workers are fully
capable of directly managing expropriated property.

### From Pacifist Anarchists

Some anarchists oppose violent or coercive forms of expropriation on
ethical grounds. This tension has existed throughout anarchist history,
with some emphasizing moral purity over strategic necessity.
