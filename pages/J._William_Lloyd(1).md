**J. William Lloyd** (June 4, 1857 – October 23, 1940) was an American
"<a   href="Individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">"individualist anarchist</a>, mystic and
pantheist writer. Lloyd based his anarchism upon
"<a   href="natural_law.md" class="wikilink" title="natural law">"natural
law</a>, rather than on
"<a   href="Egoist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="egoism">"egoism</a> as
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a> did. He later modified his
political position to
"<a   href="minarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="minarchism">"minarchism</a>.

## Family

Lloyd was born in "<a   href="Westfield,_New_Jersey.md" class="wikilink"
title="Westfield, New Jersey">"Westfield, New Jersey</a>. Little is known
about his immediate family background.

## Early Life

After his birth in New Jersey, Lloyd moved to Kansas, then Iowa, before
joining experimental colonies in
"<a   href="Tennessee.md" class="wikilink" title="Tennessee">"Tennessee</a> and
"<a   href="Florida.md" class="wikilink" title="Florida">"Florida</a>. He
returned to New Jersey in 1888. As a young man, he attended a water-cure
medical college but never graduated, though he was sometimes called a
"drugless physician."

## Adulthood

Lloyd's anarchist activism began in earnest in the 1890s. His first
book, "Wind-Harp Songs" (poetry), was published in 1895. Earlier,
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a> had issued "Anarchists'
March," a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, in 1888.

In 1897, he founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free
Socialists, based on his work "The Red Heart in a White World: A
Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope."

Lloyd's life changed significantly in 1897 when, reading
"<a   href="Edward_Carpenter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Edward Carpenter">"Edward Carpenter</a> while riding on a train to
New York, he experienced
""<a   href="Cosmic_Consciousness.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cosmic Consciousness">"Cosmic Consciousness</a>" (R.M. Bucke
devoted a chapter to Lloyd in his 1901 book of that title). This
inspired his book "Dawn-Thought on the Reconciliation: a Volume of
Pantheistic Impressions and Glimpses of Larger Religion" (1900).

He founded his magazine "The Free Comrade," which first ran from 1900 to
1902. There he championed anarchism,
"<a   href="Free_Love.md" class="wikilink" title="free love">"free love</a>,
"<a   href="Walt_Whitman.md" class="wikilink" title="Walt Whitman">"Walt
Whitman</a> ("Our American Shakespeare, and greater than he") and Edward
Carpenter ("The greatest man of modern England"). In 1902 and 1904 were
published his two utopian novels, "The Natural Man: A Romance of the
Golden Age" and "The Dwellers in Vale Sunrise: How They Got Together and
Lived Happy Ever After."

*The Free Comrade* resumed publication in a new series from 1910 to
1912. Lloyd co-edited it with his friend Leonard D. Abbott, who financed
its publication. Between the end of the original series and the
beginning of the new, Lloyd had stopped considering himself a pure
anarchist, joining the Socialist Party while stating: "I am still
anarchistic in the essential sense.... the great need of Socialism is a
stronger infusion of Anarchism...." Meanwhile his friend Abbott had
moved from socialism towards anarchism. They saw the new series "as an
advocate of the juncture of the Anarchist and Socialist forces."

He wrote hundreds of poems, many of which appeared in anarchist
periodicals. Lloyd supported the Allies in World War I and moved to
California in 1922. In the 1930s he promoted the ideas of
"<a   href="Edward_Bellamy.md" class="wikilink" title="Edward Bellamy">"Edward
Bellamy</a>. Throughout his life he maintained friendly relations with
former associates.

### Free Love

Lloyd's writings appeared in "<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a>'s
""<a   href="Liberty_(1881-1908).md" class="wikilink"
title="Liberty">"Liberty</a>"; in
"<a   href="Moses_Harman.md" class="wikilink" title="Moses Harman">"Moses
Harman</a>'s anarchist and free love journal "Lucifer the Light Bearer";
the anarchist and sex-radical newspaper "Fair Play"; the anarchist paper
""<a   href="Free_Society.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Society">"Free
Society</a>," Horace Traubel's "Conservator"; and many other
publications. He had a column in "Ariel," published by the Christian
Socialist George Littlefield.

Lloyd developed revolutionary ideas about sexuality and relationships.
He was a strong critic of patriarchy and sexual possessiveness, viewing
the historical fall of Matriarchy as "the great crime" and seeing
jealousy as akin to monopoly attained by legal power. He developed a
concept called "The Larger Love" - a vision of human love and sex
relations where each adult would normally have a Central Love (a primary
mate) plus one or several Side Lovers, forming a "Love Family" or "Love
Group."

### Personal Life

Lloyd maintained correspondence and friendships with many prominent
anarchists and freethinkers of his era. Will S. Monroe wrote in 1931
that "Carpenter's most devoted American disciple is J. William Lloyd,
who did more than any other follower in the United States (Ernest Crosby
excepted) to familiarize our countrymen with his doctrines."

## Death

J. William Lloyd died on October 23, 1940.
