The solar system's planets each exhibit tendencies of self-organization
according to Lee F. Klinger:

> Indeed, every planet in this solar system may be viewed as a complex
> system, self-organized and self-regulating in a state some distance
> from equilibrium \[...\] Self-organization is clearly evident in the
> rings of Saturn. Self-regulation is seen in the persistent red spot on
> Jupiter. Mars, Venus, and the moon all have surface features with
> symmetrical and fractal properties (Bruno et al., 1992). Hence, all
> planets might be considered complex systems.[^1]
