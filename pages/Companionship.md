# Anarchist companionship

The **anarchist companionship** was the relationship system of the
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
movement in
<a href="Western_Europe" class="wikilink" title="Western Europe">Western
Europe</a> at the end of the 19th century, encompassing both formal and
informal anarchist networks guided by shared values such as
<a href="hospitality" class="wikilink"
title="hospitality">hospitality</a> and financial or practical aid to
fellow companions. These networks also engaged in supporting other
social struggles of the period—even those that were not explicitly
anarchist.

This transnational network, lacking a real nerve center or central
authority, allowed anarchists of the time to meet, consult, and
undertake joint actions while providing them with significant mobility
across Europe. The companions shared a set of structuring elements that
united them: common values, a shared commitment to the anarchist
struggle, and a collective imaginary, particularly shaped by the
anarchist press and songs of the period.

Born as a response to state repression in Europe, this shifting and
decentralized network proved difficult for authorities to control. They
portrayed it as the result of a vast international anarchist
conspiracy—an interpretation that does not reflect the reality of
anarchist companionship. Attempts to suppress it generally failed due to
its elusive nature.

After the <a href="Ère_des_attentats" class="wikilink"
title="Ère des attentats">Ère des attentats</a> (1892–1894) and the
growing distinction between
<a href="Individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchists">individualist anarchists</a> and
<a href="Anarchist_communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a>, anarchists turned to
other forms of action and coordination, particularly
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>. Although anarchist
companionship eventually disappeared, some anarchists continue to use
the term to refer to themselves, making it an anarchist counterpart to
the more <a href="Communist_state" class="wikilink"
title="communist">communist</a>-linked term of
'<a href="comrade" class="wikilink" title="comrade">comrade</a>'.

## Terminology

The term companion literally means 'bread fellow, messmate'.[^1] The
term replaced *citizen* among
<a href="Anarchism_in_France" class="wikilink"
title="anarchists in France">anarchists in France</a> in the early 1880s
for several reasons, some of which were noted by the
<a href="Georges_Ernest_Boulanger" class="wikilink"
title="Boulangist">Boulangist</a> newspaper *La Cocarde* in 1888:

> "A few words about this epithet companion, which anarchists use to
> refer to one another. Citizen was the republican word—I would even say
> the revolutionary one. But citizen implied a right of citizenship
> (civitas, civis), a contract agreed upon with a governing power:
> citizen suited only slaves—from an anarchist perspective. Something
> else had to be found. They created the term companion, which, in fact,
> carried no obligations."

## Anarchist companionship

### Typology of companionship

During this period, companions were generally men, although women could
also be part of the movement. Contrary to the view upheld in earlier
historiography of the movement, companions were not necessarily young,
celibate men. In the French Nord department, for instance, among male
companions, 67% were between 20 and 35 years old, 27.7% were over 35,
and only 4.8% were under 20, which presents the image of a movement
primarily composed of militants in their 'age prime'. Moreover, police
reports on companions indicate a relatively equal number of married and
single men, without accounting for
<a href="Free_union" class="wikilink" title="free unions">free
unions</a> or <a href="cohabitation" class="wikilink"
title="cohabitation">cohabitation</a>, which also existed.

In France, a certain number of companions were foreigners, mainly
Italians, Russians, Polish, Belgians, Spanish, or British people.
However, sources on them are difficult to analyze, as they belonged to
circles that were challenging for the French authorities to infiltrate,
making precise details hard to determine. From a socio-economic
perspective, companions were predominantly involved in manual work, but
far from all of them were artisans. Additionally, their professions
varied greatly depending on location—while one city might have a
majority of artisans, another might have mostly factory workers, making
the composition of the movement quite diverse.

### General principles and practices

The term companion gave its name to anarchist companionship, the
structural network of the anarchist movement in Western Europe at the
end of the 19th century. This network, composed of anarchists who
self-identified as companions, had no real nerve center. However,
contrary to what *La Cocarde* claimed—describing it as carrying no
obligations—being a companion actually entailed a series of duties
toward others. First and foremost, being a companion meant being
socialized among anarchists. This socialization primarily took place
through meals and dinners organized by certain groups. These gatherings
allowed anarchists to meet, introduce one another, coordinate, assess
the reliability of different individuals—in short, they helped unify the
movement.

The duties of companions were quite demanding. Firstly, they were
expected to demonstrate total <a href="hospitality" class="wikilink"
title="hospitality">hospitality</a> toward fellow companions and, in
some cases, toward those in need. This hospitality extended beyond
simply offering food and shelter to passing anarchists; it also involved
hiding and assisting individuals sought by the authorities, helping them
evade capture. In some cases, hospitality even went as far as helping
the hosted companion find employment.

Furthermore, companions provided financial assistance to one another.
They organized fundraising efforts to support imprisoned companions or
those in financial distress. In these fund collections—such as the case
of companion Faure and her children, who received financial support from
the anarchist movement when her husband was imprisoned—distance was not
an obstacle. Parisian companions, for example, could organize
fundraising efforts for companions located across France or even in
other countries.

As state repression increased, groups of companions became increasingly
closed off — to guard against police informants, any newcomer to a group
was closely monitored for a period of time by the companions. This
included following the individuals or comparing the declared and actual
financial resources of a given individual. If the information uncovered
raised suspicions about someone, they could be publicly accused during a
meeting and confronted by others, potentially leading to their exclusion
from the movement. Such use of non-state intelligence was noted by state
intelligence services, who wrote in France, for example:

> "Anarchist groups appear to be open to everyone, but each member, once
> admitted, is carefully scrutinised. They are treated with suspicion
> until their exact position is known, including the workplace, their
> resources, and expenses. If their life is regular, all is well. If
> they spend a lot, they are observed to determine whether their
> expenses exceed their income. In such a case, they must justify their
> resources. If they cannot, they are quietly expelled. Several members
> have already been expelled in this manner."

The companions also helped each other carry out actions. For example,
<a href="Sante_Geronimo_Caserio" class="wikilink"
title="Sante Geronimo Caserio">Sante Geronimo Caserio</a>, an Italian
companion who did not speak a word of French, arrived in Lyon with the
plan to <a href="Assassination_of_Sadi_Carnot" class="wikilink"
title="assassinate Sadi Carnot">assassinate Sadi Carnot</a>, who was
responsible for
<a href="Repression_of_January_and_February_1894" class="wikilink"
title="major repressions against the anarchist movement">major
repressions against the anarchist movement</a>. Unfamiliar with the
city, he met some companions and was placed along Carnot's route—at the
precise location where the assassination could take place. Bouhey
considers this a likely example of mutual aid among companions, even
between militants from different countries who did not speak the same
language.

The companionship system could be used for terrorism, as in this case,
but the actions carried out by companions were highly diverse. They
included political propaganda, organizing public readings for illiterate
militants or those seeking education, and holding public meetings to
promote their cause. Companions could also coordinate public
disturbances or engage in
<a href="Glossary_of_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individual reclamation">individual reclamation</a>—stealing
property from bourgeois targets to redistribute it. For instance,
<a href="Louise_Michel" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
Michel</a> was accused of organizing, alongside her companions, the
looting of Parisian bakeries in 1883. She allegedly used these networks
to meet and encourage other anarchists to help her incite a popular
uprising, aiming to seize bakeries in protest against the high price of
bread.

Finally, companions were generally well integrated into the social
struggles of their time, to which they attached great importance.
However, their stance toward the workers' movement was ambiguous, as
they saw strikes, political parties, and even unions as, at best,
useless. Nevertheless, they believed they had to take part in these
struggles despite their reservations, and companions sometimes supported
broader non-anarchist causes.

Despite these duties, companions could be tolerant toward one another
and their practical compromises with
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.
In that regard, Faure wrote:

> "Of course, the concessions they make to the bourgeois environment, to

> whatever they think."

### Repression and the anarchist terrorist conspiracy?

The companionship system, which was by nature relatively clandestine and
outside state control, became a target for Western authorities, who
sought to dismantle it.[^2] To achieve this, political authorities
framed anarchists as part of a vast transnational conspiracy. The French
police and press claimed that anarchists were preparing a generalized
plot of attacks from London, which was not true. While London did serve
as a safe haven for some anarchists, offering refuge and support, there
was no centralized coordination of terrorist activities. Furthermore,
the French police became highly alarmed, falling into a state of
collective paranoia regarding London-based anarchists—many of whom did
not even support terrorism or
<a href="propaganda_of_the_deed" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>.

The authorities were caught off guard by the existence of political and
moral agreements uniting anarchist companions, which they attributed to
the influence of propagandists and attempted to oppose by criminalising
them. Thus, in France, the first *loi scélérate* (villainous law) of 18
December 1893, which redefined the concept of criminal associations in
French law while claiming to combat these agreements preventively,
targeted this system but failed to hinder companionship because it was
based on a legal framework ill-suited to this new reality. It also did
not adequately define the various characteristics of anarchist
companionship, according to a jurist of the time regarding the
government's failure in the
<a href="Trial_of_the_Thirty" class="wikilink"
title="Trial of the Thirty">Trial of the Thirty</a>. The jurors refused
to believe in associations between people who had never met and
refrained from convicting most of the accused; "since anarchist
companionship was neither an association nor a conspiracy, the
legislator should not have applied the old forms of conspiracy to it".

### Structuring elements

#### Shared symbols and references

Although the companionship network was loose and lacked central
authority, companions generally shared a common worldview. First and
foremost, they used the same symbols and historical references. The
history of the working class and the repression against labor movements
were key structuring elements, as anarchists integrated and reclaimed
these memories. Events such as the
<a href="Semaine_sanglante" class="wikilink"
title="Semaine sanglante">Semaine sanglante</a> ('Bloody Week') or other
massacres like the <a href="Haymarket_affair" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Square massacre">Haymarket Square massacre</a> became
crucial shared historical references. Additionally, some symbols became
widely adopted among companions, most notably the
<a href="Anarchist_symbolism" class="wikilink" title="black flag">black
flag</a>.

#### Shared worldview

By borrowing symbols from the <a href="labour_movement" class="wikilink"
title="labour movement">labour movement</a>, anarchists reinterpreted
them to differentiate themselves from
<a href="Socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialists">socialists</a>.
Furthermore, the emergence of
<a href="Anarchism_and_the_arts" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist art">anarchist art</a>, particularly anarchist songs,
helped spread their ideals and deeply influenced the movement. Anarchist
press also played a unifying role, providing companions with similar
perspectives on the world. These perspectives often depicted their
society as profoundly violent and unequal, with a stark opposition
between oppressors and the oppressed, engaged in a struggle to the
death.

#### Diverse but unified theories and end

In terms of theory, companions followed various ideological
perspectives, leading to major internal debates. However, despite these
differences, companions, especially in the 1880s, saw themselves as part
of a single movement. At first, this diversity of opinions did not
significantly impact the unity of the companionship network. However, by
the mid-1890s, the <a href="Ère_des_attentats" class="wikilink"
title="Ère des attentats">Ère des attentats</a> (1892–1894) and the
growing divide between
<a href="Individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchists">individualist anarchists</a> and
<a href="Anarchist_communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a> led to fractures
within companionship. This shift ultimately resulted in the rise of new
organizational forms, such as
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>.

## Legacy

Although the companionship system faded in favor of new structures and
methods, the term 'companion' continues to be used by some anarchists,
who prefer it over 'comrade', a term more closely associated with
<a href="Communist_state" class="wikilink"
title="communism">communism</a>.[^3]

## Criticism and nuances

Anarchist companionship in France was primarily studied by Vivien Bouhey
in his work *Les Anarchistes contre la République* ('The Anarchists
against the Republic'), where he highlighted these networks and raised
many interesting points, but tended to rely heavily on police sources,
which were therefore not very objective.[^4] He tended to present
companionship as a well-established "organization", thus following, at
least to some extent, the mistaken police narrative of the time
regarding it. Simon Luck, who specializes in the sociology of political
organizations, criticizes these perspectives and prefers instead the
idea of "coordination, of networks of solidarity and mutual aid, rather
than organization".
