The **Indus Valley Civilization**, also known as the **Harappan
Civilization**, was a possibly
"<a   href="List_of_Anarchist_Societies.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist society">anarchist society</a> that flourished from
approximately 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE (with its mature period lasting from
2600 to 1900 BCE). With a population of five million people at its
height, it has no strong evidence of having had warfare, inequality, or
hierarchy.[^1]

Named after the Indus River, it encompassed at least 800,000 square
kilometers in land now known as Pakistan, India and Afghanistan.[^2] The
entire society was composed of more than 1,000 cities and towns, with
many more smaller villages and hamlets in between.

In a *Journal of Archaeological Research* article, archaeologist Adam S.
Green posited, "The Indus civilization was egalitarian, but this is not
because it lacked complexity; rather, it is because a ruling class is
not a prerequisite for social complexity."[^3]

The Indus civilization included two major cities: Mohenjo-daro and
Harappa.[^4] It's likely that Mohenjo-daro served as a religious center
and Harappa as a trading center. Given the lack of any state or
military, there was no domination of cities and towns over the
countryside.[^5]

## Culture

Burial sites indicate that people were buried with roughly equal amounts
of burial goods. Luxury goods including stoneware bangles, carnelian
beads, and stamp seals, were available to the entire population. Within
each community, there was not much difference in the sizes of peoples'
houses.[^6]

The Indus Valley civilization had diffuse ritual practices and no state
religion. There were no monumental representations of rulers, gods or
even priests.[^7] There were no large temples and, according to
Gelderloos, no strong evidence of there being priests.[^8] There were
also no pictures of military conquest.[^9]

There were at least three recognized genders. In addition to women and
men, there were *hijras*. Often intersex or assigned maleness at birth,
they adopted feminine traits and tended to be either celibate or
sexually involved with men.[^10]

It's unclear to what degree there may have been gender inequalities. In
Harappa, "female figurines are generally dressed and ornamented more
elaborately than males."[^11] However, Charles Keith Maisels claims that
skeletal studies, though showing no class inequalities, do indicate
"male/female inequalities which are even present in hunter-gatherer
societies."[^12]

Even though wealth was distributed evenly throughout the city, Graeber
and Wengrow speculate that an upper caste which lived in the Upper
Citadel and the Great Bath reflected their concern with purity.[^13]
This speculation has been criticized by some reviewers[^14] and sharply
conflicts with Adam Green's interpretation.[^15] As Graeber and Wengrow
acknowledge, the first known written reference to South Asian caste
comes from the *Rig Veda* composed much later (around 1200 CE).[^16]

Maisels finds that a caste system emerged only in the civilization's
late, declining period.[^17]

## Decision-Making

There were no palaces, monuments to kings, or other indications of a
state. One statue, theorized by earlier archeologists to be a
"priest-king," is now widely considered to be a portrayal of a
neighboring society.[^18]

Given the relatively equal size of housing and equal access to water
supply and drainage, number of communal buildings (notably public baths
and granaries), drastic differences in technology and urban design
compared to hierarchical civilizations of the same time period (e.g.
Egypt and Sumer) and the lack of any centralized political buildings
such as courts, palaces, military barracks or parliaments, it can be
safe to assume that the most likely method of decision-making was some
kind of "<a   href="confederation.md" class="wikilink"
title="confederation">confederation</a> rooted in
"<a   href="Democratic_Assembly.md" class="wikilink"
title="local assemblies">local assemblies</a>.

## Economy

The "urban planning, sewage, and hygienic systems were the best in the
ancient world."[^19] The first known urban sanitation systems - where
waste water from houses was directed by gravity to covered drains
running through the city streets - were developed in the Indus River
Valley Civilization. These systems were more advanced than any other in
the world and are still more well-developed than current urban areas of
India and Pakistan.

Farmers grew millets and rice in the summer and wheat and barley in the
winter. Domesticated animals were used for meat, hide, bone, and
traction.

The region also witnessed the first applications of hydraulic
engineering, impressive dockyards, granaries, warehouses, public baths,
canals, irrigation, accuracy in measuring length, mass and time, the
development of a uniform system of weights and measurement across the
entire area, the production of metals (copper, bronze, tin and lead),
and the first use of dentistry and wheeled transport.

There were large collective works including the Great Bath and Pillared
Hall at Mohenjo-daro and nonresidential structures at Harappa. It is
estimated that one of the foundation platforms at Mohenjo-daro would
have required 10,000 builders for more than one year.[^20] Andrew
Robinson, writing in *New Scientist* speculates that some of this labor
may have been coerced or even involved slavery,[^21] but Green
emphasizes that there is no evidence of a ruling class and that large
projects can be coordinated horizontally.[^22]

In Mohenjo-daro, although the Upper Citadel contained the grander
non-residential buildings, wealth was evenly distributed throughout the
city. Metals, gemstones, shells, clay figurines, writing, and weights
and measurements were found widely dispersed in the so-called Lower
Town.[^23]

There is debate regarding the extent to which the Indus Valley
civilization used artificial irrigation.[^24]

The trade network around the civilization appears to extend from as far
as Crete and Egypt, through the Arabian Peninsula, the coast of Persia,
Central Asia and into Central India. Trade was managed via
animal-powered wheeled carts and an extensive maritime network composed
of docks and ships.

In terms of modern
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
theory, the economy mainly resembled a
"<a   href="Mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualist">mutualist</a> one
with elements of "<a   href="Anarcho-Communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>.

### City-Countryside Balance

Given the lack of any military or state, the cities did not subordinate
rural areas. Maisels notes "villages were not oppressed by the towns.
Doubtless the absence of royal or state capitals is significant in this;
which is certainly not to say that towns and cities were absent, rather
that they were not politically dominant."[^25]

Green writes: "The diversity and flexibility of their agricultural
practices indicates that Indus farmers were not likely trapped in
subordinated tributary relations with a ruling class."[^26] Gelderloos
notes:

> "the lack of military structures suggests that the rural population
> traded their surplus more or less voluntarily with the artisans of the
> towns and cities; without a military, the cities could not subjugate
> the countryside or do anything worse than impose mildly unfavorable
> balances of trade"[^27]

## Crime

Due to the absence of a state, conflicts were negotiated locally and
often informally. There was, according to Maisels, "a negotiated,
ideologically, constrained and consensual understanding of 'law', not a
'legal process' established through the courts of a central authority,
but a localized, relatively informal, dispute resolution process."[^28]

Gelderloos writes: "it might be possible that collectively (and
violently) enforced social norms were in place, leading to a
decentralized practice of killing authoritarian would-be leaders as well
as people engaging in behaviors perceived as anti-social, such as
murder, rape, or theft."[^29]

## Neighboring Societies

There is no evidence of military weaponry, and the artwork does not
portray humans fighting other humans. The sole portrayal of a human
fighting is a mythical depiction with the opponent represented as a
female deity with goat horns and a tiger's body.[^30] Although Harappa
had city walls, the walls were too low and weak to serve as defensive
structures, and Harappa did not have an army.[^31]

## Environment

When the Indus Valley civilization encountered "natural interruption of
the monsoon cycle and a decrease in precipitation," which residents did
not cause, they "migrated upland to a territory that still had
sufficient natural irrigation, and shifted to a more decentralized,
small-scale settlement pattern."[^32]

## Collapse

The Indus River Valley Civilization appeared to enter a 600-year long
period of decline beginning in 1900 BCE, with the progressive moving of
the population from cities followed by a distinct loss of signs of
culture despite people still living in the same area. Explanations for
the civilization's eventual collapse include attacks from outsiders,
climate change, earthquakes, and disease.[^33] Several theories have
been proposed:

### Invasion

The first theory proposed to explain the decline, supporters point to
skeletons uncovered in cities with damage indicating military combat.
This theory was eventually debunked, showing the damage the skeletons
had faced was caused by erosion from wind and water.

### Climate Change and Drought

The '4.2 kiloyear event' theory hypothesizes that a significant period
of drought and cooling occurred across the world. This altered the
course of rivers and led to less rainfall, making water supplies more
difficult to access and eventually leading to the abandoning of the city
model into smaller, self-sufficient villages.

### Earthquakes

There is geological evidence showing damage from major earthquakes
around the time of the decline beginning. It has been speculated that
these earthquakes not only caused massive physical damage but changed
the structure of the coastline and waterways, rendering much of the
civilization's dependence on infrastructure unusable.

### Disease

Skeletons dated towards the end of the civilization show an increase in
infectious diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis, suggesting a
massive plague swept the region and rapidly destroyed much of the urban
population, whilst the more isolated rural and village population was
able to survive.
