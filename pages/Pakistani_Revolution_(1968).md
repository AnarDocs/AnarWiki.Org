that brought down the military dictatorship which had ruled Pakistan for
11 years and saw a brief window into the possibility of a democracy and
even land reform. But, the movement was somewhat co-opted by another
military dictator who continued to repress the country. The revolution
was part of a wider wave of revolts across the world in the

## Background

Since independence from the British Empire in 1947, Pakistan had only
seen 1 election (in 1947) and had otherwise been ruled by dictators that
presided over a corrupt and unequal country which had a small welfare
state and little rights for workers. After the revolutions of the late
1960s and early 1970s, many people began to turn this into anger.

## Events

Mobilisation began by socialist and liberal organisers in 1967, mainly
by the unemployed and students, with some students burning their degrees
in protests. After many protest marches were held, police opened fire on
one and killed 3 people, leading to an eruption in strikes, refusal to
pay public transport fares, more protests, road blockades which
paralysed the capital city and even the execution of landlords and
seizure of land by peasants. Police officers who attacked protesters
were also frequently killed.

## Results

After months of protests and violence, in March 1969 the army
