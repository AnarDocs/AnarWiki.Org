The "<a   href="Wikipedia:Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee">Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee</a>, or SNCC, coordinated a network of autonomous
student groups in the U.S. Civil Rights and Black Liberation movements
from 1960 into the 1970s. According to historian Howard Zinn, "SNCC
without knowing about anarchism as philosophy embodied the
characteristics of anarchism."[^1] Anarchist and former SNCC member
Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin described the early SNCC as a largely successful
experiment in internal democracy:

> I learned a lot about internal democracy by being a part of SNCC, how
> it could make or break an organisation, and how it had so much to do
> with the morale of the members. Everyone was given an opportunity to
> participate in the decision making, and felt part of a great
> historical mission, which would change their lives forever. They were
> right.[^2]

According to political scientist Herbert Haines, SNCC "deserves a large
measure of the credit for the vast changes which occurred there during
the 1960s." [^3]

SNCC was formed at a April 15-17, 1960 conference in Raleigh for members
of the student-led sit-in movement, which had started in February when
four black students sat at a white-only lunch counter in Greensboro,
North Carolina. Ella Baker, then the director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), organized the student conference. Baker
urged the young activists to form an organization that would remain
autonomous from the established civil rights groups. The students heeded
Baker's advice and established SNCC. Baker and Zinn both became adult
advisers to the new organization.

Midway through the decade, SNCC shifted toward a more centralized,
hierarchical structure. In 1966, SNCC embraced the slogan Black Power,
which "for some--not all--meant black nationalism".[^4] It changed its
name in 1969 to Student National Coordinating Committee. By 1971, the
group "had all but disappeared."[^5] Many SNCC members went on to work
with the "<a   href="Black_Panther_Party_and_Anarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>.

# Structure

In the words of its constitution (as revised in 1963), SNCC served "as a
channel of coordination and communication for the student movement." The
committee consisted of delegates from local groups who were elected for
one year. The committee, in turn, elected an Executive Committee to
handle administrative tasks and manage staff members. SNCC did not
exercise extensive centralized authority over local groups; the
constitution affirmed that "local protest groups and affiliates are
autonomous".[^6]

Unlike the mainstream US civil rights groups, SNCC adopted a
participatory democratic decision-making structure. Decisions required
the full consensus of everyone in the room. Former SNCC activist and
historian Staughton Lynd recounted:

> Decisions were made by consensus, that is, with the support of
> everyone in the room. I have heard Northern radicals mock such
> consensus decisionmaking as petty bourgeois, and inappropriate for
> serious revolutionaries. But the reason SNCC made decisions by
> consensus was precisely because their work was so much more dangerous
> than anything being done in the North: in such a setting, no one felt
> comfortable making a decision by majority rule that might cost
> somebody else’s life.[^7]

Howard Zinn explained the contrast between SNCC and the mainstream,
hierarchical groups. "Other civil rights organizations, for example
\[Southern\] Christian Leadership Conference, were centralized
organizations with a leader -- Martin Luther King. National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) were based in New York,
and also had some kind of centralized organization. SNCC, on the other
hand, was totally decentralized. It had what they called field
secretaries, who worked in little towns all over the South, with great
deal of autonomy. They had an office in Atlanta, Georgia, but the office
was not a strong centralized authority. The people who were working out
in the field -- in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi -- they
were very much on their own. They were working together with local
people, with grassroots people."[^8]

Much of SNNC's radical democratic influence came from Ella Baker, a
mentor and administrator for SNCC. Baker had held leadership positions
in the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, but she
felt stifled by the sexism and bureaucracy of both organizations.
Criticizing the Civil Rights movement's overreliance on charismatic
leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., Baker had said, "Strong people
don't need strong leaders." Baker identified as a Socialist, but for
much of her life she did not belong to any particular political party or
tendency. Her biographer Barbara Ransby described Baker as "A Freirian
teacher, a Gramscian intellectual, and a radical humanist".[^9]

In the middle of the decade, SNCC adopted a more hierarchical structure.
The sociologist Francesca Polleta observed that the change in structure
took place by early 1965, before SNCC had shifted toward a black
nationalist position. Poletta argued that the shift occurred when
participatory democracy "came to be seen as ideological, oriented to
personal self-transformation, and--no coincidence--as white."[^10] A
1968 memorandum on "The New SNCC" authored by longtime SNCC activist
James Forman posited, "it is impossible for a revolutionary organization
to move effectively if its command structure is decentralized and split
into many places."[^11]

SNCC famously struggled with sexism, as detailed in a 1964 position
paper by Mary King and Casey Hayden, two white women in SNCC. Their
paper listed instances of the group's gender discrimination, for example
when "\[t\]wo organizers were working together to form a farmers league.
Without asking any questions, the male organizer immediately assigned
the clerical work to the female organizer although both had had equal
experience in organizing campaigns."[^12] Infamously, Stokley
Charmichael once joked, "What is the position of women in SNCC? The
position of women in SNCC is prone."[^13] Barabara Ransby argues that
although sexism existed in SNCC, "it was not institutionally supported
or encouraged." Moreover, Charmichael's joke must be seen alongside a
later statement, "I would not have been taken seriously as a leader of
an organization like SNCC if I had not taken seriously the leadership of
women". As Chairman, Charmichael appointed several women as project
directors. [^14]

# Vision

Although SNCC did not explicitly espouse an anti-authoritarian vision,
the historian and SNCC adviser Howard Zinn wrote thought their approach
signalled a rejection of hierarchy, both internally and externally. He
summarized at the end of his work *SNCC: The New Abolitionists* (1965
edition), "What really makes SNCC a threat to American liberal society
is that quality which makes it a threat to all Establishments, whether
capitalist, socialist, communist, or whatever: its rejection of
authority; its fearlessness in the face of overwhelming power; its
indifference to respectability."[^15]

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, SNCC became internally more
hierarchical but also more explicitly revolutionary. They shifted from a
focus on racial integration to a focus on Black Power. Under this newer
vision, SNCC became an all-black organization and it urged white
sympathizers to organize white communities against racism.[^16] In 1966,
SNCC openly took a controversial stance against American intervention in
Vietnam (Martin Luther King first publicly condemned the war over a year
later).[^17] Surpassing King's anti-imperialism, SNCC sided with the
Palestinian struggle against Zionism.[^18] By 1968, SNCC openly
advocated against capitalism.[^19]

# Nonviolence and Self-Defense

In its earlier years, SNCC endorsed complete nonviolence. Its original
statement of purpose began, "We affirm the philosophical or religious
ideal of nonviolence as the foundation of our purpose, the
presupposition of our faith, and the manner of our action."[^20] In
1969, SNCC changed the second word in its name from "Nonviolent" to
"National," signifying a rejection of pacifism. The shift has sometimes
been presented as a transformation from an unarmed struggle to an armed
struggle.

However, even in SNCC's self-professed nonviolent phase, participants
organized with and lived with black community members in the U.S. South
who were armed and ready to defend the movement with weapons if
necessary. The former SNCC field secretary Charles Cobb argues that
sympathizers' "willingness to use deadly force ensured the survival not
only of countless brave men and women but also of the freedom struggle
itself."[^21]

In Mississippi, Laura McGhee and her sons housed SNCC participants and
hosted civil rights events. At night, they guarded their property with
weapons. The farmer E.W. Steptoe housed SNCC member Bob Moses. When
Moses asked Steptoe not to bring a gun to an organizing meeting, Steptoe
simply hid the weapon from Moses's sight.[^22]

SNCC staff member Holly Watkins stayed with a married couple who ran a
farm. Dave Howard and wife took shifts guarding the house at night from
white supremacist attackers. Watkins began taking night shifts to help
out with armed guarding of the house.[^23]

Former SNCC participant Stokley Charmichael described bringing an
elderly women to vote in Alabama: "She had to be 80 years old and going
to vote for the first time in her life...That ol' lady came up to us,
went into her bag, and produced this enormous, rusty Civil War-looking
pistol. 'Best you hol' this for me, son, I'ma go cast my vote
now.'"[^24]

# Freedom Rides

In 1961, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) brought together
thirteen people, seven Black and six white, to travel from Washington
D.C. to New Orleans, sitting together on segregated buses, eating
together at segregated restaurants, using restrooms in violation of the
"Whites Only" and "Colored" signs.

One part of the group took a Greyhound bus, and the other took a
Trailway bus. At the stop in Rock Hill, South Carolina, white hoodlums
punched SNCC member John Lewis in the head and kicked him on the floor.
Then, they attacked two other Riders. Police simply watched the beatings
at first, before eventually stopping them. Outside of Anniston, Alabama,
on Mother's Day, a mob surrounded and firebombed one of the Riders'
buses, leaving twelve passengers briefly hospitalized. As the second bus
arrived in Anniston, eight whites entered and forced the Black Riders to
sit in the back. When this bus arrived in Birmingham, a mob followed and
attacked the Riders with iron pipes. All assembled in Birmingham, the
Riders, could not find any bus driver willing to drive them further.
They decided to fly to New Orleans and end the first Freedom Ride.[^25]

SNCC decided to resume the Freedom Rides. SNCC member Diane Nash
assembled a team of ten students--eight Black and two white--in
Nashville, Tennessee. John Siegenthaler, assistant to Attorney General
Robert Kennedy, recalled a conversation with Nash:

> "So I called her. I said, 'I understand that there are more Freedom
> Riders coming down from Nashville. You must stop them if you can.' Her
> response was, 'They’re not going to turn back. They’re on their way to
> Birmingham, and they’ll be there shortly.'
>
> You know that spiritual, 'Like a tree standing by the water, I will
> not be moved'? She would not be moved. And I felt my voice go up
> another decibel and another, and soon I was shouting, “Young woman, do
> you understand what you’re doing? You’re going to get somebody — do
> you understand you’re going to get somebody killed?” And there’s a
> pause, and she said, 'Sir, you should know, we all signed our last
> wills and testaments last night, before they left. We know someone
> will be killed.'[^26]

On May 17, the Nashville group boarded a bus to Birmingham. Police
arrested all ten students, and they spent a night in jail in Birmingham.
The police chief "Bull" Connor drove them to the Tennessee border and
let them off in the middle of nowhere. On May 20, however, the Nashville
group assembled back in Birmingham, this time joined with other
supporters, making a total of twenty people. The team embarked by bus to
Montgomery.

The Freedom Riders were greeted in Montgomery by a mob of about three
hundred people, with clubs and sticks. No police had shown up. The the
white supremacists attacked the journalists first, including a CBS
cameraman and a Time-Life reporter. Once the mob had pushed out the
journalists, they attacked the Freedom Riders. Several women pointed out
the white Rider James Zwerg and yelled, "Kill the nigger-loving son of a
bitch." Bernard Lafayette, another Freedom Rider, recalled what happened
next:

> "\[The mob\] knocked him over the rail. And then they picked him up
> and stood him in front of the rail again and knocked him over, knocked
> his teeth out. And they kept clobbering him and kicking him on the
> ground. And they took a crate, a cola crate, and hit John Lewis on the
> head, gashed him on the head."[^27]

On May 24, twenty-seven Freedom Riders left Montgomery for Jackson, in
two buses. All twenty-seven were arrested upon arrival.[^28] In
November, the Interstate Commerce Commission implemented the
desegregation of all travel facilities, following a Justice Department
ruling in September. SNCC had helped secured a major, national victory
for the Civil Rights movement.[^29]

# Freedom Summer

In the summer of 1964, SNCC brought over 1,000 volunteers,
overwhelmingly white, to Mississippi to register Black voters and teach
in community education programs. This campaign, known as Freedom Summer,
sought to increase the participation of white supporters of civil rights
and to catch the nation's attention as these white volunteers faced some
of the same violence that constantly threatened Black communities. The
political scientist Doug McAdam described the campaign strategy: "The
logic ran as follows: if the murders, beatings, and mailings SNCC
workers had endured in Mississippi had not been enough to stir public
attention, perhaps America--and, in turn, the federal government--would
take notice if those being beaten and shot were the sons and daughters
of privileged white America."

Throughout the summer, some 17,000 Blacks to attempted to register to
vote. State registrars rejected all but 1,600 of their applications. In
addition, Freedom Summer volunteers signed up 80,000 people as members
of a mock political party called the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party, or MFDP. Unlike the official Democratic Party, the MFDP accepted
Blacks as members. In August, sixty-eight MFDP delegates travelled to
the Democrats' national convention in New Jersey and demanded to be
seated instead of the all-white official Mississippi Democratic chapter.

Volunteers also ran "Freedom Schools", community schools providing
classes in academic areas, culture and leadership development to between
3,000 and 3,500 Mississippians. [^30] SNCC activist Tom Waham described
the goals of the Freedom Schools: "We want to bring the student to a
point where he questions everything he reads or is taught--the print
word, movies, the 'power structure'--everything." Historian Barbara
Ransby described the Freedom Schools as a "type of 'free space' within
the movement for creative and intellectual work" where "\[r\]igid
hierarchy was abandoned, and the curriculum was designed to reflect the
world and heritage of the schools' students."[^31]

On June 21, Freedom Summer volunteer Andrew Goodman joined SNCC staff
members James Charney and Michael Schwerner to investigate a church
bombing. They never returned, and their dead bodies we discovered in
August. Charney had been brutally beaten. Goodman and Schwerner had been
shot.

In August, when Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates demanded
to be seated at the Democratic National Convention, the Democrats
offered a compromise, in which only two MFDP delegates would be seated.
In a betrayal of the grassroots, Martin Luther King Jr. publicly
supported the compromise. The MFDP delegates rejected the compromise and
instead occupied a row of seats in the convention hall. Security
officers carried them outside.[^32]

Ella Baker saw Freedom Summer as a success for its role in exposing the
Democratic Party elites and radicalizing participants and observers from
around the country. Doug McAdam concluded that Freedom Summer "served as
both the organizational basis for much of the activism of the Sixties as
well as an important impetus for the development of the broader
counterculture that emerged during the era."[^33]

# Foreign Policy Positions

SNCC took cutting-edge positions against U.S. and Israeli imperialism.
In 1966, SNCC became the first civil rights group to publicly oppose the
Vietnam War. In 1967, the SNCC newsletter published a statement against
Zionism. From some of SNCC's supporters, there was a hostile reaction to
the anti-Zionist position. Although SNCC's funds were already drying up,
staffer Dorothy Zellner later called the 1967 controversy the "death
blow" to the organization. For some members, the hostile reaction
stiffened their resolve to take positions in solidarity with Third World
liberation struggles.[^34]
