The Jōmon people lived in the archipelago of what's now northeastern
Japan, beginning around 14,000 BCE or as early as 16,000. Beginning
around 12,000 BCE, they lived as perhaps the world's first sedentary
foragers; James C. Scott notes they were "contemporaneous with and
likely earlier than the
"<a   href="Natufian.md" class="wikilink" title="Natufian">"Natufian</a> period
in the Fertile Crescent."[^1]

By the "Middle Jōmon" period, around 3500 to 2500, the Jōmon
supplemented foraging with non-cereal cultivation including "lacquer
tree (Toxicodendron verniciﬂua) and nut tree (Castanea crenata and
Aesculus turbinata) management,and probable domestication of barnyard
millet and soybean as well as cultivation of bottle gourd and hemp and
possible cultivation of Perilla and adzuki."[^2]

The Jōmon interacted with neighboring societies in what's now China and
Korea, and a tin-bronze knife from northwestern China arrived in the
archipelago probably around 2800 BCE. While those societies adopted
millet agriculture around 3500 to 2700 BCE, the Jōmon did not adopt
cereal cultivation. Only with the transition from the Jōmon to Yayoi
culture around 900 or 800 BCE did grain agriculture arise on the
archipelago.[^3]

Archeologist Chis Gosden argues the Jōmon intentionally rejected grain
agriculture as a way of maintaining relative egalitarianism.[^4]

In the "Late Jōmon" and "Final Jōmon" periods, from around 2500 to 900
or 800 BCE, a diversity of burial goods may suggest rising inequality
and "the use of curved magatama beads as grave goods suggests individual
ownership."[^5]

Goettner-Abendroth contends the society became more stratified in the
Yayoi Period (300 B.C.E.-300 C.E.), as migrants brought new cultures and
agricultural techniques from the south, and became patriarchal in the
subsequent Kofun Period began (300–710 C.E.).[^7]
