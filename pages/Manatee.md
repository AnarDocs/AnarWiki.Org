Animals" by Lyta Gold and Nick Sirotich[^1]:

> The manatee—commonly referred to as the sea cow—is the most *socially
> responsible* of all animals. Peaceful, slow, and *majestic*, the
> manatee is both a confirmed *vegetarian* and a *gourmand*, chewing
> thoughtfully on a diverse variety of water plants for up to seven
> hours per day. While some humans consider the manatee *mermaid-like*
> and beautiful, others have labeled them *funny-looking*. Manatees
> themselves are indifferent. They have evolved beyond the artificial
> beauty standards imposed by *consumer capitalism*.
