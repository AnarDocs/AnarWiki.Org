# Objectivism

## Overview

**Objectivism** is a "<a   href="philosophical_system.md" class="wikilink"
title="philosophical system">philosophical system</a> developed by
Russian-American writer
"<a   href="Ayn_Rand.md" class="wikilink" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> in the
mid-20th century. Rand described it as "the concept of man as a heroic
being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with
productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only
absolute."[^1]

Despite Rand's claims to have created an entirely novel philosophical
system grounded in pure reason and objective reality, Objectivism is
largely a crude repackaging of existing
"<a   href="right-libertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-libertarian">right-libertarian</a> and
"<a   href="classical_liberal.md" class="wikilink"

ethics, mixed with "<a   href="Friedrich_Nietzsche.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nietzschean">Nietzschean</a> rhetoric about supermen and the
masses.[^2] The philosophy serves primarily as an intellectual
justification for "<a   href="laissez-faire_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="laissez-faire capitalism">laissez-faire capitalism</a> and
"<a   href="egoism.md" class="wikilink" title="egoism">egoism</a>, rejecting

From an anarchist perspective, Objectivism represents a perversion of
genuine "<a   href="libertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian">libertarian</a> thought, appropriating the language
of individual freedom while advocating for

## Origins

Ayn Rand was born to a wealthy St. Petersburg family in 1905 during
"<a   href="Czarist_Russia.md" class="wikilink" title="Czarist Russia">Czarist
Russia</a>. Her privileged position in Czarist society—wealthy enough to
afford a French governess and take regular vacations to the
Crimea—profoundly shaped her worldview.[^3] It should be noted that
wealth in Czarist society was almost wholly dependent on favor with the
government, with few genuine examples of individuals lifting themselves
from "<a   href="serfdom.md" class="wikilink" title="serfdom">serfdom</a>
without the Czar's patronage.

At age twelve, Rand experienced what she considered a great injustice
when workers took over her father's business during the
"<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Her family fled to
the Crimea for the protection of the White Army. This experience
rendered her forever incapable of seeing
"<a   href="land_reform.md" class="wikilink" title="land reform">land
reform</a> or any struggle of oppressed and exploited people as anything
more than "hatred for the good and lust for the unearned."[^4]

Rand first expressed her philosophy in fiction, most notably in
*"<a   href="The_Fountainhead.md" class="wikilink" title="The Fountainhead">The
Fountainhead</a>* (1943) and
*"<a   href="Atlas_Shrugged.md" class="wikilink" title="Atlas Shrugged">Atlas
Shrugged</a>* (1957), before elaborating it in essays and books.
"<a   href="Leonard_Peikoff.md" class="wikilink"
title="Leonard Peikoff">Leonard Peikoff</a>, designated as Rand's
intellectual heir, later gave Objectivism a more systematic structure,
characterizing it as a "closed system" whose "fundamental principles"
were set by Rand and are not subject to change.[^5]

## Core Tenets

### Metaphysics and Epistemology

Objectivism's metaphysics begins with three axioms: existence,
consciousness, and identity. Rand argued that reality exists
independently of consciousness and that humans have direct contact with
reality through sense perception. She claimed that objective knowledge
can be attained through
"<a   href="concept.md" class="wikilink" title="concept">concept</a> formation
and "<a   href="logic.md" class="wikilink" title="inductive logic">inductive
logic</a>.[^6]

Rand defined reason as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the
material provided by man's senses" and rejected all forms of
"<a   href="faith.md" class="wikilink" title="faith">faith</a>,
"<a   href="mysticism.md" class="wikilink" title="mysticism">mysticism</a>, or
"<a   href="intuition.md" class="wikilink" title="intuition">intuition</a> as
means of knowledge.[^7]

### Ethics

Rand's ethics claims that life is the ultimate value, arguing that "it
is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value'
possible."[^8] She defined life as "a process of self-sustaining and
self-generated action" and argued that an organism's survival is its
standard of value.

From this foundation, Rand derived what she called "rational
self-interest" or "rational egoism" as the proper moral code. She
explicitly rejected altruism, defining it (following
"<a   href="Auguste_Comte.md" class="wikilink" title="Auguste Comte">Auguste
Comte</a>) as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. The
three cardinal values of Objectivist ethics are Reason, Purpose, and
Self-Esteem, with corresponding virtues of Rationality, Productiveness,
and Pride.

### Politics

Objectivism's political philosophy advocates for laissez-faire
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
as the only moral social system. Rand argued that individual
rights—particularly property rights—are necessary for all other rights.
The basic political principle of Objectivism is the "non-initiation
principle": "no man may initiate the use of physical force against
others."[^9]

Rand supported a
"<a   href="minarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="minarchist">minarchist</a>
state limited to police, military, and courts to protect individual
rights. She explicitly opposed
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>,
arguing that "putting police and courts on the market is an inherent
miscarriage of justice."[^10]

## Key Objectivist Terms and Anarchist Responses

### Volitional Consciousness

**Objectivist Definition:** Rand argued that "man's particular
distinction from all other living species is the fact that his
consciousness is volitional."[^11] This means humans must choose to
think, to focus their minds, and to use reason. The choice "to think or
not to think" is fundamental, with thinking requiring effort and focus
while "unfocusing" leads to a subhuman level of consciousness.

**Anarchist Response:** While anarchists recognize human agency and the
importance of conscious choice, the Objectivist concept of "volitional
consciousness" ignores material and social conditions that shape human
thought and action. People's capacity to "choose to think" is profoundly
affected by
"<a   href="poverty.md" class="wikilink" title="poverty">poverty</a>,
"<a   href="education.md" class="wikilink" title="education">education</a>,
trauma, and social structures. The concept serves to morally condemn the
poor and oppressed for their circumstances, suggesting they simply chose
not to think properly. Anarchists recognize that genuine freedom of
thought requires meeting material needs and dismantling oppressive
hierarchies—not merely demanding individuals "choose" to think while
ignoring the conditions that constrain their choices.

### Man Qua Man

**Objectivist Definition:** This Latin phrase means "man as man" and
refers to what Rand considered the proper standard for human survival.
She wrote: "Man's survival qua man means the terms, methods, conditions,
and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the
whole of his lifespan."[^12] This distinguishes mere physical survival
from living properly as a rational being.

**Anarchist Response:** This concept reveals Objectivism's fundamental
contradiction. If life is the ultimate value, then physical survival
should be paramount. But Rand admits some forms of life are not worth
living as "man qua man," meaning other values can supersede survival.
This exposes that Rand does not actually value life itself, but a
particular aristocratic vision of how certain people should live. The
concept also serves to dehumanize those Rand considers
"subhuman"—workers who don't own businesses, people who accept social
welfare, or anyone who doesn't conform to her vision of the rational
egoist. From an anarchist perspective, all humans deserve dignity and
freedom regardless of whether they meet Rand's arbitrary standards.

### The Virtue of Selfishness / Rational Self-Interest

**Objectivist Definition:** Rand argued for "rational selfishness" as
opposed to both altruism and whim-driven selfishness. She claimed that
rational self-interest means pursuing one's objective values—those
determined by reason and required for one's survival as a rational
being—rather than arbitrary desires or the demands of others.

**Anarchist Response:** Rand's "rational self-interest" is neither
rational nor genuinely self-interested. By defining "rational" values as
those supporting capitalist productivity and property relations, she
assumes the conclusion she wants to prove. Anarchists recognize that
humans are social beings whose genuine self-interest includes
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="solidarity">solidarity</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and community. As
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> demonstrated, cooperation is often more adaptive and
beneficial than competition. Rand's philosophy mistakes the
socially-constructed values of
"<a   href="bourgeois.md" class="wikilink" title="bourgeois">bourgeois</a>
society for objective rational requirements, ignoring how
"<a   href="class_society.md" class="wikilink" title="class society">class
society</a> creates artificial scarcity and conflict that make her
dog-eat-dog worldview seem natural.

### Trader Principle

**Objectivist Definition:** The trader principle holds that moral people
relate to each other by trading value for value, never giving or taking
the unearned. As Rand wrote, people should neither sacrifice themselves
to others nor sacrifice others to themselves. Each person trades their
productive work for fair compensation.

**Anarchist Response:** The trader principle ignores the reality of
"<a   href="exploitation.md" class="wikilink"
title="exploitation">exploitation</a> under capitalism. Workers produce
far more value than they receive in wages, with the surplus appropriated
by property owners. This is not a fair trade but
"<a   href="theft.md" class="wikilink" title="theft">theft</a>. The principle
also makes invisible all forms of necessary labor that capitalism
doesn't compensate—"<a   href="domestic_labor.md" class="wikilink"
title="domestic labor">domestic labor</a>,
"<a   href="care_work.md" class="wikilink" title="care work">care work</a>,
community building, and environmental maintenance. Anarchists recognize
that not all valuable human activity can or should be commodified, and
that a genuinely free society would be based on
""<a   href="from_each_according_to_ability,_to_each_according_to_need.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to ability, to each according to need">from
each according to ability, to each according to need</a>," not
transactional "trading." The trader principle essentially sanctifies
capitalist exploitation as moral virtue.

### Looters and Moochers

**Objectivist Definition:** In Rand's terminology, "looters" are those
who use political power to take wealth they didn't earn—particularly
government bureaucrats and corrupt businessmen who profit through state
intervention. "Moochers" are those who survive by begging or accepting
charity, particularly welfare recipients. Both are considered immoral
parasites who violate the trader principle.

**Anarchist Response:** Rand's categories reveal her class bias and
historical ignorance. The actual "looters" in history have been
capitalists who enclosed the
"<a   href="commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a>,
dispossessed indigenous peoples, enslaved millions, and accumulated
wealth through violence and state power—the
"<a   href="primitive_accumulation.md" class="wikilink"
title="primitive accumulation">primitive accumulation</a> that created
capitalism. The "moochers" are often those who have been dispossessed by
this process, denied access to land and resources, and forced into
"<a   href="wage_slavery.md" class="wikilink" title="wage slavery">wage
slavery</a> or destitution. Anarchists recognize that the real parasites
are the
"<a   href="ruling_class.md" class="wikilink" title="ruling class">ruling
class</a> who live off the labor of workers, not the poor who struggle
to survive under exploitative conditions. Rand's contempt for the
vulnerable exposes the cruelty at the heart of Objectivism.

### The Sanction of the Victim

**Objectivist Definition:** This concept holds that evil requires the
sanction of its victims—that oppression continues only because the
oppressed accept it as legitimate or moral. In *Atlas Shrugged*, the
heroes go on strike, withdrawing their sanction from a society that
exploits them.

**Anarchist Response:** While anarchists agree that oppressed people
must refuse to legitimize their oppression, Rand completely inverts who
the actual victims are. In her narrative, capitalists are the oppressed
victims of worker demands and government regulation. In reality, workers
are exploited by capitalists who control the means of production and use
state violence to maintain their privilege. The anarchist concept of
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> and
"<a   href="general_strike.md" class="wikilink" title="general strike">general
strike</a> genuinely represents victims withdrawing their sanction—but
it means workers refusing to continue enriching capitalists, not
capitalists refusing to continue employing workers. Rand's "strike of
the mind" is fantasy; anarchist
"<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a> is
reality achieved through actual class struggle.

### A is A (Law of Identity)

**Objectivist Definition:** This represents Rand's axiom of identity:
existence is identity, everything is itself and acts according to its
nature. As she wrote, "A leaf cannot be all red and green at the same
time."[^13] This logical principle supposedly grounds all of Objectivist
philosophy.

**Anarchist Response:** Anarchists don't dispute basic logic, but Rand's
use of the law of identity serves to naturalize social relations and
deny the possibility of change. When applied to humans and society, "A
is A" becomes a justification for
"<a   href="essentialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="essentialism">essentialism</a>—the idea that people, classes, and
social systems have fixed natures. This contradicts anarchist
understanding that humans are shaped by social conditions and that
revolutionary transformation is possible. Rand uses logical tautologies
to make capitalism seem like a natural law rather than a historically
specific social arrangement. The law of identity tells us nothing about
what social relations should exist; it's simply misused to forestall
questioning of
"<a   href="hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a> and
"<a   href="domination.md" class="wikilink" title="domination">domination</a>.

### Productive Achievement

**Objectivist Definition:** Rand held that "productive work is the
central purpose of a rational man's life, the central value that
integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values."[^14]
Productive achievement—particularly in business and industry—is
humanity's noblest activity.

**Anarchist Response:** Rand's concept of "productive achievement" is
both narrow and class-biased. She romanticizes capitalists and inventors
while denigrating workers who actually produce goods and services. Her
heroes are industrialists who command others, not the workers who do the
actual labor. Anarchists recognize that all socially useful labor is
valuable—not just that which generates private profit. Moreover, Rand
ignores how capitalism forces people to work under threat of starvation,
making "productive work" coerced rather than freely chosen. In a genuine
anarchist society based on
"<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">voluntary association</a>, people would
engage in creative and useful activity not because they must to survive,
but because such activity is fulfilling when done freely and
cooperatively.

### The Non-Initiation Principle

**Objectivist Definition:** The fundamental political principle of
Objectivism: "no man may initiate the use of physical force against
others."[^15] Force may only be used in retaliation against those who
initiate it. This principle supposedly justifies capitalism while
prohibiting taxation, regulation, and social programs.

**Anarchist Response:** The non-initiation principle is fatally flawed
because it assumes "<a   href="property_rights.md" class="wikilink"
title="property rights">property rights</a> as pre-political natural
facts rather than social constructs enforced by violence. When a
landowner uses force to evict someone from "their" property, or when
police arrest workers for occupying "their" factory, Objectivists don't
count this as initiation of force but as "defense of rights." But these
"rights" were established through historical
violence—"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">enclosure</a>,
"<a   href="colonialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">colonialism</a>,
"<a   href="slavery.md" class="wikilink" title="slavery">slavery</a>—and are
maintained through ongoing state coercion. Anarchists recognize that
capitalist property itself is initiated force against the dispossessed.
A genuine non-initiation principle would reject not only the state but
also private property in the means of production, supporting instead
common ownership and
"<a   href="usufruct.md" class="wikilink" title="usufruct">usufruct</a> rights
based on occupancy and use.

## Anarchist Critique

### The Contradiction at the Heart of Objectivism

Objectivism contains a fundamental contradiction in its treatment of
"life" as the ultimate value. Rand begins by arguing that physical
survival is the ultimate value—"that which is required for the
organism's survival"—but ends by advocating for a specific kind of life
that may require choosing death over "survival at any price."[^16]

In *Atlas Shrugged*, Rand's hero John Galt explicitly states he would
rather die than compromise his principles. When facing torture, he even
instructs his torturers on how to fix their torture machine rather than
cooperate with them. As JudgeSabo notes, "letting himself be tortured
and telling them how to fix his torture machine was not, in fact, the
most rational choice John Galt could have made to maintain his own
physical survival."[^17]

This reveals that Rand does not actually hold physical survival as the
ultimate value, but rather a particular vision of how a "rational being"
should live—even if this vision requires sacrificing one's life. She
performs a sleight-of-hand, beginning with "life" defined as survival
but ending with "life" meaning "the kind of life proper to a rational
being."

### The State and Hierarchy

From an anarchist perspective, Rand's defense of the state fundamentally
contradicts her claims about individual freedom. She justifies state
power through a
"<a   href="Thomas_Hobbes.md" class="wikilink" title="Hobbesian">Hobbesian</a>
state of nature theory, arguing that without organized government,
society would descend into "chaos and gang warfare."[^18]

This belief in the inherent depravity of human nature—that we are
forever incapable of living without rulers—"clearly places her outside
of the libertarian tradition which views human nature as essentially
good, capable of indefinite improvement through the experience of
freedom and the exercise of reason."[^19]

Moreover, Rand's acceptance of state monopoly on retaliatory force as a
given, something not requiring justification, reveals an authoritarian
core. As Klafeta argues, "Her concept of national sovereignty is then
something transcendental, existing separate and apart from individuals,
and beyond the right of the individual to accept or reject according to
his or her own reason."[^20]

### Property Rights and Exploitation

Rand's insistence that government enforcement of
"<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private contracts">private contracts</a> is necessary
fundamentally alters the nature of so-called "free agreements." As
Klafeta explains:

> "Agreements are made on terms which otherwise might not be, because
> they are justiciable. The terms of 'free agreements' under law are
> titled in favor of lenders over debtors, landlords over tenants,
> employers over employees, in a way which would not exist in a 'free
> market.' This leveraging of power is not 'objective' at all."[^21]

Rand's philosophy completely ignores how wealth in hierarchical
societies—including the Czarist Russia she grew up in—is primarily a
measure of proximity to state power rather than productive achievement.
Her idealized ""<a   href="captains_of_industry.md" class="wikilink"
title="captains of industry">captains of industry</a>" are more
accurately understood as beneficiaries of state-granted privileges and
"<a   href="class.md" class="wikilink" title="class">class</a> exploitation.

### The Perversion of Libertarianism

Historically, "libertarian" meant socialist—specifically
"<a   href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a> or anarchist.
The term was appropriated by right-wing capitalists in the mid-20th
century, with Rand playing a significant role in this linguistic
theft.[^22]

True libertarianism—anarchism—means the self-emancipation of working
people, the abolition of hierarchical class relations, and the creation
of a society based on "<a   href="free_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and "<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>.
Rand's "libertarianism" means the freedom of
"<a   href="capital.md" class="wikilink" title="capital">capital</a> to
exploit "<a   href="labor.md" class="wikilink" title="labor">labor</a>,
defended by state violence.

As Klafeta concludes: "Libertarianism is and always will mean
socialism—the self emancipation of working people. Libertarians must
stop courting the Republican right and return to their intellectual
roots."[^23]

### The Cult of Personality

Beyond its intellectual failures, Objectivism fostered a cultic movement
around Rand herself. Despite preaching individualism, Rand gathered an
inner circle ironically called "The Collective" that demanded "slavish
conformity of one's life and professed philosophy to Ayn Rand's whims
and eccentricities."[^24] Members who questioned Rand or failed to
conform to her personal preferences—such as her dislike of facial hair
or Mozart—were expelled.

This authoritarian tendency within a movement claiming to champion
reason and individualism reveals the fundamentally hierarchical nature
of Objectivism. Like "<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>, it professes liberation
while creating new forms of domination.

## The Capitalism That Never Was

Objectivism's entire political project rests on advocacy for
"<a   href="laissez-faire_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="laissez-faire capitalism">laissez-faire capitalism</a>. Yet this
foundation crumbles under examination using Objectivism's own
epistemological premises:

**Premise 1:** Concepts are the conceptual classification of observed
phenomena.

**Premise 2:** Invalid concepts are those that do not have existing
phenomena.

**Premise 3:** Truth is a thing which comes from facts of reality.

**Conclusion 1:** True concepts are real and existent.

**Premise 4:** Capitalism (defined by Objectivists as pure
laissez-faire) has never existed, even in the United States.

**Conclusion 2:** Capitalism, which has never existed, is not a valid
concept nor a truth.

By Objectivism's own standards, advocating for laissez-faire capitalism
is advocating for an invalid concept with no basis in observed
reality—precisely what Rand accused mystics and socialists of doing. The
"capitalism" that has actually existed has always involved
"<a   href="state_intervention.md" class="wikilink"
title="state intervention">state intervention</a>,
"<a   href="monopoly.md" class="wikilink" title="monopoly">monopoly</a>
privileges, "<a   href="imperialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="imperialism">imperialism</a>, and
"<a   href="primitive_accumulation.md" class="wikilink"
title="primitive accumulation">primitive accumulation</a> through
violence.

## Anarchist Alternatives

In contrast to Objectivism's defense of capitalism and the state,
anarchism offers genuine pathways to freedom:

**"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communism">Anarcho-communism</a>** emphasizes the
principle of
""<a   href="from_each_according_to_ability,_to_each_according_to_need.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to ability, to each according to need">from
each according to ability, to each according to need</a>," recognizing
that genuine freedom requires meeting everyone's material needs through
voluntary cooperation.

**"<a   href="Mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutualism">Mutualism</a>**
advocates for a non-capitalist market economy based on labor exchange,
"<a   href="credit_unions.md" class="wikilink" title="credit unions">credit
unions</a>, and worker ownership, rejecting both state socialism and
capitalist property relations.

**"<a   href="Anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a>** focuses on
building
"<a   href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>
through revolutionary labor unions that can both contest capitalism now
and form the basis of a free society.

All anarchist tendencies share a recognition that genuine freedom
requires abolishing both state and capitalist hierarchies, replacing
them with horizontal, voluntary associations based on
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="solidarity">solidarity</a>
rather than domination.

## Legacy and Influence

While Objectivism as a formal philosophy never achieved widespread
acceptance, Rand's ideas have had significant influence on right-wing
politics, particularly within American
"<a   href="conservatism.md" class="wikilink"
title="conservatism">conservatism</a> and the
"<a   href="propertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="propertarian">propertarian</a> movement that misleadingly calls
itself "libertarian."[^25]

Academic philosophers have largely dismissed Objectivism, with many
deliberately excluding Rand from philosophical encyclopedias.[^26] Her
appeal has been primarily to young people in their "formative years,"
many of whom later abandon her ideas as they mature and gain deeper
understanding of ethics, economics, and social relations.[^27]

From an anarchist perspective, Rand's most enduring and harmful legacy
is providing intellectual cover for
"<a   href="greed.md" class="wikilink" title="greed">greed</a>,
"<a   href="selfishness.md" class="wikilink"
title="selfishness">selfishness</a>, and
"<a   href="exploitation.md" class="wikilink"
title="exploitation">exploitation</a>, wrapped in the language of reason
and freedom. Her work represents not a triumph of rationality but a
triumph of
"<a   href="rhetoric.md" class="wikilink" title="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>—telling
the wealthy and powerful what they want to hear while dismissing the
struggles of the oppressed as mere "hatred for the good."
