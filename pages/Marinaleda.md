**Marinaleda** is a small town in Seville,
<a href="Spain" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a> which has been
described by its mayor and journalists as a
'<a href="List_of_Anarchist_Societies" class="wikilink"
title="communist utopia">communist utopia</a>'. Located in the
autonomous community of
<a href="Andalusia" class="wikilink" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>,
this municipality of 2,778 inhabitants has become renowned for its
radical economic model and anti-capitalist principles.

## History

### Early Struggles

The modern political character of Marinaleda emerged from centuries of
exploitation by large landowners. During the 18th century, the town was
dominated by landless labourers who earned just two
<a href="Spanish_real" class="wikilink" title="reals">reals</a> for a
full day's work under the Marquess of Estepa.[^1]

### Civil War and Franco Era

During the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, troops supporting the
coup assassinated the mayor, Vicente Cejas Moreno, his son, and at least
30 other residents. In the postwar period under
<a href="Francisco_Franco" class="wikilink"
title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s dictatorship, the
population suffered great poverty, hunger, and repression. The poor
survived by gleaning olives and acorns from the fields of the
estates.[^2]

### Land Struggle Movement

Upon Franco's death in 1975, the dictatorship gave way to democracy. In
1977, the Sindicato de Obreros del Campo (Union of Farm Workers) was
founded in Marinaleda. The following year, a struggle for land began
with a two-day occupation of the Bocatinaja estate.[^3]

The first post-Franco municipal elections were held in 1979, with the
<a href="Unitarian_Candidacy_of_Workers" class="wikilink"
title="Colectivo de Unidad de los Trabajadores">Colectivo de Unidad de
los Trabajadores</a> (Workers' Unity Collective) winning 9 of the 11
council seats. The new council immediately replaced street names
associated with the Civil War victors with names of left-wing heroes -
<a href="Agustín_Muñoz_Grandes" class="wikilink"
title="Muñoz Grandes">Muñoz Grandes</a> street became
<a href="Che_Guevara" class="wikilink" title="Che Guevara">Che
Guevara</a> street, the Plaza of Spain became the People's Plaza, and
the Plaza of Francisco Franco was renamed after
<a href="Salvador_Allende" class="wikilink"
title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a>.[^4]

### Escalating Actions

In 1980, 700 people staged a 13-day hunger strike, demanding better pay
and stricter regulation of employment. This success led to
intensification of the land struggle, with occupations of large estates
under the slogan "Land to those who work on it".[^5]

In 1984, the Cordobilla marsh was occupied for 30 days to demand
irrigation for El Humoso farm, property of the Duke of Infantado. In
1985, estate occupations increased to over 100 actions, some lasting
more than 90 days.[^6]

Finally, in 1991, a 1,200-hectare tract of El Humoso farm was handed
over to Marinaleda for use by the population. In 1997, the Marinaleda
S.C.A. cooperative was founded to cultivate the farm collectively.[^7]

## Decision-Making

The town follows the standard
<a href="Liberalism" class="wikilink" title="liberal">liberal</a> model
of a <a href="Representative_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a>, but
despite the eccentric communist mayor. It is more likely that the towns
unique policies are due to the constant hunger strikes, occupations of
government buildings and hostility towards traditional spanish politics
means that it is more the autonomous power of the working class and the
states desire to not deal with an insurrection that is the reason for
the towns ability to experiment.

For over 40 years,
<a href="Juan_Manuel_Sánchez_Gordillo" class="wikilink"
title="Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo">Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo</a> of
the <a href="United_Left_(Spain)" class="wikilink"

his retirement in 2023 due to ill health. His successor is

## Crime

Marinaleda has been called a "utopia for peace", which has no municipal
police (saving \$350,000 a year).[^9]

## Economics

The town has maintained full employment (in a country of high
unemployment) by creating <a href="Worker_Cooperatives" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperatives">worker cooperatives</a> in the industries of
farming (producing wheat, artichokes, lettuce, tomato, peppers, broccoli
and beans) as well as
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed factories">self-managed factories</a> which produce
canned goods.[^10]

The town operates a farming cooperative with 2,650 workers on a
3,000-acre farm located 7 miles north of Marinaleda. The farm grows
labour-intensive crops like artichokes, hot peppers, broccoli, and broad
beans, as well as wheat. A food processing plant was established in
2000, supplied by raw materials from the cooperative including piquillo
pepper, beans, artichokes, and olives, along with an oil press.[^11]

During the <a href="euro_area_crisis" class="wikilink"
title="euro area crisis">euro area crisis</a>, while 30% of the active
population in Andalusia was without work, Marinaleda maintained full
employment.[^12]

### Housing

Housing costs are extremely low in Marinaleda, as you can own a house
for 15 euros a month. Land is owned
<a href="Commons" class="wikilink" title="commonly">commonly</a> and
neighbours and builders help out new homeowners in the spirit of
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.[^13]

The municipality operates a unique self-building program where the local
government provides land, building materials, and architectural plans
through public grants, along with free assistance from professional
builders. Prospective owners usually donate about 450 days of their work
to construction, with these hours deducted from the total cost. To
prevent speculation, citizens are prohibited from selling their
homes.[^14]

Citizens reside in a colony of neat houses, each with three bedrooms,
one bathroom, and a garden of 100 square metres. In recent years, 350
single-family homes have been built according to this scheme.[^15]

Since the transition towards a cooperative economy, the town has built a
<a href="Education" class="wikilink" title="school">school</a>, a TV
station, a radio station, parks, childcare centers, aged care homes,
doctors offices and a swimming pool.[^16]

## Culture

Additionally, political murals and revolutionary slogans adorn the
town's whitewashed walls and streets are named after Latin American
leftists (like Che Guevara). Every few weeks, the town hall declares a
Red Sunday over a bullhorn and volunteers clean the streets or do odd
jobs[^17]

Marinaleda is part of the "Network of Municipalities for the
<a href="Republicanism_in_Spain" class="wikilink"
title="Third Republic">Third Republic</a>" and the
<a href="Flag_of_the_Second_Spanish_Republic" class="wikilink"
title="tricolor flag">tricolor flag</a> is present in civil
buildings.[^18]

The town's official website describes their philosophy of "Social
Democracy" as follows: "By Social Democracy we mean unlimited access to
all forms of well-being for the whole population of our village. We have
always thought that liberty without equality is nothing, and that
democracy without real well-being for real people is an empty
word."[^19]

## Criticism

Critics claim that Marinaleda's economic and social progress is due in
part to the fact that almost 66% of the income received by the
municipality comes from administrative superiors such as the state, the
autonomous community, and the Provincial Council of Seville.[^20]
However, research shows that Marinaleda actually receives less than the
average remittance received by municipalities in Andalusia - in 2011 it
received around 6.61% less than the regional average.[^21]
