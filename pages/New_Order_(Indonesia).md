## Crimes Against Humanity

The New Order was responsible for four major crimes against humanity.

- The Anti-Communist Mass Killings
- The Occupation of West Papua
- The Occupation of East Timor
- The Petrus Killings

### The Anti-Communist Mass Killings

In 1965, the '30 September Movement' killed the six top generals in the
country, the action was blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI)
although it was likely done by the army with US support. The army then
began a massive killing spree so large it bordered on a civil war across
the country for the next year. Between 500,000 and 3,000,000 people had
been killed (0.4 to 2.8% of the population) and the CIA secretly
compared it to the
<a href="Holocaust" class="wikilink" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> and
the Red Terrors in China and Russia.[^1]

- Killing methods included shooting, stabbing, beheadings, impaling,
  disemboweling, cutting off people's limbs and letting them bleed to
  death, strangling and castration (forced removal or disfiguring of
  genitals).
- Killing devices included assault rifles, small arms, knives, sickles,
  machetes, swords, ice picks, bamboo spears, iron rods and other
  makeshift weapons.
- Both men and women were subjected to sexual violence while in prisons,
  including rape and electric shocks to the genitals.
- Torture methods included severe beatings with makeshift materials like
  electric cable and large pieces of wood, breaking fingers and crushing
  toes and feet under the legs of tables and chairs, pulling out
  fingernails, electric shocks, and burning with molten rubber or
  cigarettes. Detainees were sometimes forced to watch or listen to the
  torture of others, including relatives such as spouses or children.
- Mass looting and burning down of pro-communist villages after
  killings.
- Many of the killings had a distinctly prejudiced (notably racist)
  nature against Chinese, Abangans and Atheist minorities in Indonesia.

### The Occupation of East Timor

<a href="Indonesian_Occupation_of_East_Timor" class="wikilink"
title="Indonesian Occupation of East Timor">Indonesian Occupation of
East Timor</a>*

From 1975 to 1999, the New Order engaged in a brutal occupation of East
Timor, which had just gained independence from the Portuguese Empire
following the anti-colonial war and
<a href="Carnation_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Carnation Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> in Portugal.
Despite East Timor's efforts to form an independent democratic state,
Indonesia invaded with support from Australia, the US and Britain
because they didn't ban their popular communist party. The resulting
occupation has been described as one of the most brutal in history, East
Timor routine and systematic torture, sexual slavery, extrajudicial
executions, massacres, and deliberate starvation. These actions killed
between 60,000 and 308,000 people, or between 9% and 46% of the
population.[^2] Some notable and terrifying atrocities that occurred
include:

- Burning down Timorese houses and executing Timorese indiscriminately,
  including children.
- The deliberate destruction of
  <a href="Agriculture" class="wikilink" title="farms and crops">farms and
  crops</a> in the countryside to force the population into cities where
  they would often be shot for entering or put into resettlement camps.
- These camps had no electricity, sewerage, water, medical care or
  reliable food supplies leaving people to die in a trapped space of
  starvation or disease.
- Extreme abuse of Timorese women, forced marriages, forced
  contraceptions, sexual slavery, abduction of random women by
  helicopter for sexual abuse for weeks at a time. This included teenage
  girls and children.
- Abduction of Timorese men and teenage girls to be used as a giant line
  of human shields involving tens of thousands of people.

### The Petrus Killings

From 1983 to 1985, hundreds of bodies began showing up in public places
and thousands of people connected to crime began going missing. The
government did not reveal the cause of death for months, until
eventually confessing it was done by undercover snipers working for the
Indonesian military in order to reduce
<a href="crime" class="wikilink" title="crime">crime</a> (which was
successful as the population was too scared). Between 2,000 and 10,000
people were killed by snipers.[^3]
