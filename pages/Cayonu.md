which prospered from circa 8,630 to 6,800 BCE.[^1] Located in

River</a>, Çayönü contains archaeological evidence of a dramatic social
revolution around 7200 BCE that installed an egalitarian, communist
society lasting approximately three thousand years.

The site belongs to the
"<a href="Taş_Tepeler" class="wikilink" title="Taş Tepeler">Taş
Tepeler</a>" monumental tradition of
<a href="Göbekli_Tepe" class="wikilink" title="Göbekli Tepe">Göbekli
Tepe</a>, characteristic of Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the Urfa
region. The settlement covers multiple periods including the Pre-Pottery
Neolithic A (PPNA), Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), and Pottery
Neolithic (PN) phases, demonstrating a remarkable transformation from
hierarchical structures involving human sacrifice to an egalitarian
social organization.

## Culture

### Early Hierarchical Period

The lower archaeological layers of Çayönü reveal evidence of a
patriarchal class society with disturbing cultural practices. Temples
contained blood-encrusted daggers used for human sacrifice, with one
temple containing seven hundred skeletons stacked to the ceiling.[^2]
Analysis of blood residue at the site confirmed that human sacrifice
occurred there.[^3]

Skulls were kept alongside the remains of hunted animals, leading David
Graeber and David Wengrow to identify the culture as demonstrating the
development of a cultural connection between hunting and social
domination.[^4] This period also featured architectural inequality, with
large manors contrasting sharply with slums and inferior shacks.

The site included stelae similar to the T-shaped monuments of
<a href="Göbekli_Tepe" class="wikilink" title="Göbekli Tepe">Göbekli
Tepe</a> and
<a href="Karahan_Tepe" class="wikilink" title="Karahan Tepe">Karahan
Tepe</a>, thought to represent symbolic images of men or gods. One stela
featured a human face carved in flat relief.[^5] These findings suggest
stela worship, a form of cult prevalent in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B
period.

### The Social Revolution of 7200 BCE

Around 7200 BCE, archaeological evidence suggests a dramatic social
revolution occurred at Çayönü. According to researcher Bernhard Brosius,
temples and large manors were burnt down and replaced with houses that
were roughly equal in size. The slums and inferior shacks that had
characterized the earlier settlement completely disappeared.

Brosius summarizes the transformation:

> Not only did the revolutionaries of those remote times succeed in
> overthrowing a regime thousands of years old, bloody and
> exploitative - moreover, they also succeeded in developing their own
> alternative society, devising and realizing it. The social revolution
> of the year 7200 B.C. is the hour of the birth of neolithic communism.
> An egalitarian, classless society arises in which women and men are
> equal, a society which rapidly spreads over the whole of Anatolia and
> almost simultaneously over the Balcans and which endures for 3000
> years.[^6]

### Post-Revolutionary Egalitarian Culture

Following the revolution, the culture at Çayönü and across Neolithic
Anatolia became markedly different from the hierarchical societies of
Syro-Mesopotamia. Turkish archaeologist Mehmet Özdoğan describes how
"some sort of social turbulence" was followed by "a much more
egalitarian rural economy than the centralised system of
Syro-Mesopotamia."[^7]

Significantly, Özdoğan reports that "specifically-built temples or cult
buildings are totally absent both in Anatolian and Southeast European
Neolithic cultures" during this egalitarian period. This architectural
shift represents a conscious rejection of the religious-hierarchical
structures that had characterized the earlier settlement.

Archaeological evidence shows dietary practices also reflected social
equality. Stable isotope analysis revealed that food differentiation
according to burial practice and sex decreased substantially in the
post-revolutionary period, suggesting more egalitarian access to
resources.[^8]

## Organisation

The settlement's architectural evolution reveals the organizational
transformation of Çayönü society. The stratigraphy shows distinct
phases:

- Round structures (PPNA) - earliest phase with rounded corners
- Grill-plan buildings (PPNA) - featuring carefully built stone
  foundations supporting elevated plastered floors
- Channeled buildings (Early PPNB)
- Cobble paved structures (Middle PPNB)
- Cell-plan buildings (Late PPNB)
- Large room structures (final PPNB)

The crucial transformation around 7200 BCE saw the elimination of large
differentiated structures (temples, manors) in favor of roughly
equal-sized dwellings. The grill-plan architecture, which emerged during
the egalitarian period, featured "a series of parallel linear stone
foundations, carefully built of small stones and no more than 15 cm
high, which supported an elevated plastered floor, keeping it insulated,
ventilated and dry."[^9]

This architectural standardization reflected organizational principles
of equality and collective welfare rather than hierarchical
differentiation.

## Economy

Çayönü represents a critical transition point in human economic
organization, demonstrating the shift from hunting and gathering to
agricultural production within an egalitarian framework.

### Animal Domestication

The settlement provides evidence for the earliest domestication of
several species. Çayönü is possibly the place where the pig (*Sus
scrofa*) was first domesticated.[^10] Sheep were among the first animals
domesticated, followed by cattle management that began as early as the
settlement's founding.

Regarding cattle, scholars distinguish between "cattle management" and
true "domestic cattle." Bos remains were abundant already in the
earliest levels, representing approximately 20% of mammalian remains.
Around 7500 BCE, cattle reached maximum abundance at the site but
remained phenotypically unchanged. Actual decrease in cattle size,
indicating domestication, only became evident around 7000 BCE.[^11]

### Plant Cultivation

Çayönü played a central role in the origins of agriculture. Genetic
studies of
<a href="emmer_wheat" class="wikilink" title="emmer wheat">emmer
wheat</a>, the precursor of most current wheat species, indicate that
the nearby slopes of Mount Karaca
(<a href="Karaca_Dağ" class="wikilink" title="Karaca Dağ">Karaca Dağ</a>)
were the location of first domestication.[^12]

Archaeologist Robert Braidwood documented that "cultivated emmer along
with cultivated einkorn was present from the earliest sub-phase" of the
settlement.[^13]

### Egalitarian Distribution

The post-revolutionary economy at Çayönü was characterized by more equal
distribution of resources. This egalitarian rural economy stood in
marked contrast to the centralized, hierarchical systems developing in
contemporary Syro-Mesopotamia. The absence of palatial structures or
significant wealth differentiation in burial practices suggests communal
ownership and collective management of productive resources.

## Environment

One remarkable aspect of the egalitarian period at Çayönü and across
Neolithic Anatolia was its environmental sustainability. Özdoğan
specifically notes that during this three-thousand-year period, "there
is no indication of either any environmental deterioration or
deforestation."[^14]

This stands in contrast to many hierarchical civilizations that rapidly
depleted their environments. The egalitarian organization apparently
allowed for sustainable resource management, maintaining ecological
balance while supporting human communities through agriculture and
animal husbandry.

The site's location near the Boğazçay (a tributary of the upper Tigris
River) and the Bestakot (an intermittent stream) provided water
resources that were managed sustainably throughout the settlement's
existence.

## Historical Significance

Çayönü demonstrates that egalitarian, communist social organization is
not merely a modern political aspiration but has deep historical
precedents. The settlement proves that:

- Hierarchical social structures can be overthrown through social
  revolution
- Egalitarian societies can be maintained for millennia
- Agriculture and domestication are compatible with non-hierarchical
  organization
- Gender equality can be achieved in sedentary agricultural communities
- Environmental sustainability is possible with appropriate social
  organization

The spread of this egalitarian model across Anatolia and Southeast
Europe following Çayönü's revolution suggests that non-hierarchical
social organization held significant appeal and practical advantages.
The three-thousand-year duration of this egalitarian period compares
favorably with the relatively brief existence of most hierarchical
states and empires.
