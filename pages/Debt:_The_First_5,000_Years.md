## Main Arguments

### The Myth of Barter

Graeber's most influential argument challenges the standard economic
narrative that money evolved from barter. According to mainstream
economics textbooks, people once traded goods directly (barter), found
this inefficient due to the "double coincidence of wants" problem, and
thus invented money as a solution. Graeber demonstrates through
extensive anthropological and historical evidence that this narrative is
a myth with no basis in the historical record.[^1]

Instead, Graeber argues that
"<a   href="credit.md" class="wikilink" title="credit">"credit</a> and debt
systems preceded both money and barter historically. In early societies,
people used informal systems of mutual credit and obligation, keeping
track of debts through social memory and custom rather than physical
tokens. Physical money (coinage) appeared much later, primarily to pay
soldiers and collect taxes, while barter was typically used only between
strangers or enemies who had no basis for trust.[^2]

### Debt and Violence

A central thesis of the book is that the transformation of informal,
community-building indebtedness into mathematically precise, legally
enforced debts occurs through the introduction of violence, usually
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a>-sponsored
violence in the form of military or police power. Graeber writes that
"markets are founded and usually maintained by systematic state
violence," though he notes that "in the absence of such violence,
they...can even come to be seen as the very basis of freedom and
autonomy."[^3]

This argument challenges the common assumption that markets and states
are opposing forces. Instead, Graeber demonstrates that throughout
history, states created markets, and markets require states to function
in their current form. The two institutions were "born together and have
always been intertwined."[^4]

### Human Economies vs. Commercial Economies

Graeber distinguishes between "human economies" and "commercial
economies." Human economies are systems primarily concerned with "the
creation, destruction, and rearranging of human beings" rather than the
accumulation of wealth. In such economies, currencies (whether yams,
jewelry, or other objects) serve to manage social relationships rather
than facilitate commercial exchange.[^5]

Commercial economies, by contrast, are market economies focused on
wealth accumulation. Historically, Graeber argues, these are relatively
recent innovations that require state violence to maintain, as they run
counter to human tendencies to embed economic relations within broader
social and moral frameworks.

### Everyday Communism

Graeber proposes the concept of "everyday communism" - the principle of
"from each according to their abilities, to each according to their
needs" operating in mundane daily interactions. He argues this is "the
foundation of all human sociability" and occurs whenever people
cooperate without keeping precise accounts. Examples include asking for
directions, borrowing a tool from a neighbor, or helping someone in
immediate danger.[^6]

This baseline communism, Graeber contends, makes society itself possible
and persists even within capitalist societies, though it is obscured by
economic ideology that portrays all human relations as forms of
exchange.

### Historical Cycles

The book traces alternating historical periods between credit-based
economies and bullion-based economies, correlating these shifts with the
rise and fall of empires and changes in social organization. Graeber
identifies a pattern where ages of virtual credit money are replaced by
ages of precious metal currency, which in turn give way again to credit
systems.[^7]

## Anarchist Significance

### Debt and Domination

From an anarchist perspective, the book provides crucial insights into
how debt functions as a mechanism of social control and domination.
Graeber demonstrates that throughout history, debt has been used to
justify and maintain hierarchical power relations, from ancient debt
slavery to modern
"<a   href="wage_labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">"wage labor</a>.

The book shows how the morality of debt - the notion that debts must
always be repaid - has been weaponized against the oppressed while the
powerful routinely escape their obligations. As Graeber notes in an
interview: "Business owners certainly don't feel that debts are sacred –
I can't remember the last time I did freelance work and my employer
didn't at least try pretending he just forgot to pay me!"[^8]

### Debt and Revolution

Graeber identifies debt cancellation as a recurring revolutionary demand
throughout history. From ancient Mesopotamian "clean slates" to the
Biblical Jubilee, from medieval peasant uprisings to modern movements,
the abolition of debt has been central to struggles against oppression.

He argues that virtually all major insurrections and revolts in human
history have been about debt. The establishment of Athenian democracy
and the Roman Republic, for example, largely emerged as ways of settling
debt crises. This historical pattern suggests that contemporary
movements against "<a   href="neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">"neoliberalism</a> and
"<a   href="austerity.md" class="wikilink" title="austerity">"austerity</a>
stand in a long revolutionary tradition.[^9]

### Money as Social Creation

The book reinforces anarchist critiques of capitalism by demonstrating
that money is not a natural phenomenon or neutral tool but a social
creation. If money is fundamentally a system of IOUs and promises, then
its form and function are political questions that should be subject to
democratic control rather than left to financiers and central bankers.

Graeber emphasizes that "if democracy is to mean anything, it has to
mean that it's not just the richest 1% of the population that gets to
decide who had to keep the exact letter of their promises and whose
promises can be scotched or renegotiated…but everyone."[^10]

## Market Anarchist Criticisms

While the book has been influential across anarchist tendencies,
"<a   href="market_anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="market anarchist">"market anarchists</a> and
"<a   href="mutualist.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualist">"mutualists</a>
have raised several significant critiques of Graeber's arguments and
conclusions.

### The Role of Markets

Market anarchist William Gillis argues that Graeber overstates the
negative role of markets and quantification while understating the
potential for markets to function without state violence. Gillis
contends that the problem is not markets or exchange per se, but
"violently imposed universal simplifications of richly complicated or
localized dynamics."[^11]

Gillis notes that Graeber himself acknowledges periods when free markets
emerged independently of state power, particularly in Medieval Islam,
where markets operated based on honor and trust rather than coercion.
This suggests that markets without state enforcement tend to be
reabsorbed into webs of social relations and moral economy rather than
remaining purely commercial.[^12]

### Quantification and Mathematics

Market anarchists object to Graeber's apparent hostility toward
quantification and mathematical precision in economic relations. Gillis
argues that the problem is not measurement or calculation itself, but
rather "the suppression of math by violence." He writes: "Mathematical
analysis unto itself in no way implies oversimplification or
misrepresentation. And while there are often limits to what we can know
and calculate in a given context, especially when dealing with other
minds, such limitations are themselves mathematical dynamics."[^13]

From this perspective, tools like measuring cups, precise accounting,
and even interest (when voluntary and not backed by violence) can serve
important functions in coordinating complex societies and respecting
subjective preferences. The issue is not the tools themselves but the
coercive context in which they operate under capitalism and statism.

### Calculation and Coordination

Market anarchists emphasize
"<a   href="economic_calculation.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic calculation">"economic calculation</a> problems that
Graeber largely ignores. As Gillis notes: "So long as human beings have
dreams and desires in a finite environment there will be coordination
and calculation problems to be solved...Markets provide an array of
extraordinarily useful tools for solving these coordination problems;
indeed they denote the only phase space where solutions can be found for
problems past a certain complexity."[^14]

This critique draws on "<a   href="Ludwig_von_Mises.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ludwig von Mises">"Ludwig von Mises</a>' and
"<a   href="F.A._Hayek.md" class="wikilink" title="F.A. Hayek">"F.A. Hayek</a>'s
work on the knowledge problem - the impossibility of centralized
entities possessing the dispersed, subjective knowledge necessary for
efficient economic coordination. Market anarchists argue that
decentralized, voluntary exchange remains necessary for conveying this
information even in a freed society.

### Currency and Technology

Market anarchists have also noted that Graeber wrote before the
explosion of "<a   href="cryptocurrency.md" class="wikilink"
title="cryptocurrency">"cryptocurrency</a> and decentralized currency
systems. His analysis focuses on historical forms of money while largely
ignoring potential future developments. Thinkers like Nick Szabo had
already explored how cryptographic currencies could enable more
sophisticated forms of "social currency" that track reputation and trust
without requiring state enforcement.[^15]

### Historical Selectivity

Some market anarchists argue that Graeber's historical narrative is
selectively presented. While he acknowledges free market societies like
the Harappan civilization, these examples receive minimal attention
compared to state-dominated societies. This may create a bias suggesting
that markets are more inherently statist than the evidence supports.

## Anarcho-Communist Responses

"<a   href="Anarcho-communist.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communist">"Anarcho-communists</a> have generally embraced
Graeber's work while offering their own critiques and extensions of his
arguments.

### Labor and Exploitation

Anarcho-communist critic Wayne Price argues that while Graeber correctly
emphasizes debt as a mechanism of oppression, he underplays the
centrality of labor exploitation. Price writes that Graeber "understands
everything about wage-labor except that it is a form of exploitation"
and similarly treats slavery primarily as social death rather than
forced labor for another's benefit.[^16]

From this perspective, the "deeper-lying antagonism between classes" is
the exploitation of labor, with debt serving as one mechanism among many
for extracting surplus value. Price argues: "The whole point of the
capitalist making the worker temporarily 'unequal' is to get the workers
to work for a certain number of hours to produce the equivalent of the
workers' wages and then to continue to work for several more hours,
giving (essentially unpaid) labor, producing 'surplus value.'"[^17]

### Markets and Capitalism

Against market anarchist readings, anarcho-communists like Price argue
that Graeber is correct to be suspicious of markets even when they
emerge without direct state violence. While markets may temporarily
operate on principles of honor and trust, they contain tendencies toward
commodification and inequality that can recreate oppressive relations.

However, anarcho-communist Joseph Kay offers a more nuanced reading,
suggesting that Graeber's work actually shows "without state power,
market exchanges tend not to give rise to the inhuman monster of
capital...but rather tend to be re-absorbed into a moral economy of a
human society."[^18]

This implies that anarcho-communists may be overstating the power of
capital to regenerate from market relations. Kay writes: "Rather than
capital being the all-powerful hydra that regenerates from the smallest
stumps of market behaviour, rather all societies are based on a basic
communism which threatens to assert itself whenever state power recedes,
re-embedding markets into webs of mutual aid."[^19]

### Everyday Communism

Anarcho-communists have enthusiastically embraced Graeber's concept of
"everyday communism," seeing it as validation of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
and communist organizing principles. However, they note this concept's
limitations. As Price argues, Graeber "denies that 'communism' has
'anything to do with ownership of the means of production,'" which
represents a retreat from revolutionary anarcho-communist goals.[^20]

The concept of everyday communism, while valuable for demonstrating that
communist relations already exist in daily life, does not provide a
blueprint for organizing production and distribution in a complex
industrial society.

### The Question of Value

Price criticizes Graeber for saying "virtually nothing about
commodities, what they are and how they evolved" and for complete
silence on economic value. Without addressing the
"<a   href="labor_theory_of_value.md" class="wikilink"
title="labor theory of value">"labor theory of value</a> or any
alternative theory of value, Graeber cannot fully explain how capitalist
exploitation operates or how a post-capitalist economy might
function.[^21]

### Vision for the Future

Anarcho-communists express disappointment with Graeber's limited
prescriptions for the future. His main concrete proposal - a debt
jubilee - is a reform to be implemented by those in power rather than a
revolutionary transformation to be achieved through direct action. Price
notes: "Apparently debts would not be abolished forever; people would
start over again, accumulating debts."[^22]

This vision of a society with markets, money, hierarchy, and periodic
debt cancellation falls short of the anarcho-communist goal of a
classless, stateless society based on common ownership and the principle
of "from each according to ability, to each according to need."

However, Kay suggests this criticism may be too harsh, noting that
Graeber's work on "<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a> and
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a> in movements like
"<a   href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">"Occupy Wall Street</a> demonstrates more
radical commitments than the book alone might suggest. The book's
limited prescriptions may reflect tactical choices in addressing a
mainstream audience rather than Graeber's full political vision.[^23]

### Reconciling the Critiques

Some anarchists have attempted to synthesize insights from both market
anarchist and anarcho-communist readings. The recognition that markets
without state violence tend toward reabsorption into social relations,
combined with the understanding that labor exploitation remains central
to capitalism, suggests a path beyond both state capitalism and state
socialism.

A society that abolishes both the state and capitalist property
relations might retain some market-like mechanisms for coordination
while embedding them within frameworks of mutual aid, solidarity, and
democratic control. The key question becomes not whether to have
"markets" or "planning" in the abstract, but what specific institutions
best serve human freedom and flourishing in different contexts.

## Legacy and Influence

*Debt* became a bestseller and won the inaugural Bread and Roses Award
for radical literature in 2012, as well as the Bateson Award of the
American Society for Cultural Anthropology.[^24]

The book's release coincided with the
"<a   href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">"Occupy Wall Street</a> movement, in which
Graeber played a significant role, and helped shape public discourse
around debt, inequality, and economic justice. Its influence extends
beyond anarchist circles to broader movements for
"<a   href="debt_resistance.md" class="wikilink" title="debt resistance">"debt
resistance</a>,
"<a   href="debt_strike.md" class="wikilink" title="debt strike">"debt
strikes</a>, and challenges to
"<a   href="austerity.md" class="wikilink" title="austerity">"austerity</a>
policies.

The book has been translated into numerous languages and continues to be
widely read and debated across the political spectrum, from liberals and
social democrats to various anarchist and socialist tendencies.
