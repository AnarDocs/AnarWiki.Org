## Overview

In the 1970s and early 1980s, anarchists and other anti-authoritarians
in the US antinuclear movement created what David Graeber calls "the
first appearance in North America of what we now consider standard
anarchist tactics and forms of organization: mass actions, affinity
groups, spokescouncils, consensus process, jail solidarity, the very
principle of decentralized direct democracy." Two groups stood out, the
Clamshell Alliance in New Hampshire and the Abalone Alliance in
California. Both organized massive direct actions that brought heavy
publicity to the dangers of nuclear power.[^1]

Along with steep costs and the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster, the
anti-nuclear movement was perhaps a factor in the nuclear industry's
decline since the 1970s. In the late 1960s, the industry planned to
build 1,000 nuclear power plants in the US by 2000.[^2] Today, there are
only 62. After 1974, no new nuclear plants began construction. From 1977
to 2013, no new reactors were built at existing power plants either.[^3]

## Clamshell Alliance

The Clamshell Alliance (sometimes known as The Clams) was a
spokecouncil-based alliance formed to stop the construction of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire in the 1970s. According to
historian Barbara Epstein, Clamshell “represented the first effort” in
American history other than the early civil rights movement “to base a
mass movement on nonviolent direct action.” The Alliance operated
non-hierarchically, and “many—probably most” Clams identified as
anarchists.[^4]

In February 1974, organic farmer Sam Lovejoy "took a crowbar and knocked
down a tower erected by Northeast Utilities as part of a projected
nuclear power plant. Lovejoy then hitchhiked to the Montague police
station and handed the police a written statement explaining and taking
responsibility for the action." He saw his action as a way to get the
New Left to start focusing on local issues and connect their existing
concern about nuclear weapons to the local threat of nuclear power
plants. Lovejoy went to a nine-day trial and was acquitted by the judge
on the grounds that the charge was pressed as “destruction of personal
property” whereas it should have been “real property”. Jurors later said
that they would have found Lovejoy innocent even if he had not been
acquitted on a technicality.[^5]

In 1976, after the Public Service Company of New Hampshire obtained a
license to begin building the Seabrook nuclear power plant, a small
group of activists began planning a campaign to stop the plant's
construction. The group named themselves the Clamshell Alliance after
the clams that lived on the coast near the Seabrook plant site. They
quickly committed themselves to nonviolence and consensus-based decision
making.[^6] People organized in "affinity groups", but these were
usually ad-hoc action teams as opposed to the long-term affinity groups
that were used by the FAI and advocated by Murray Bookchin. In theory,
the "Coordinating Committee" members were not empowered to make
decisions against the mandate of their affinity groups.

On 1 August 1976, the Clams held their first occupation of the
construction site. 18 people were arrested. On the 22nd, they held a
second occupation. This time, 180 were arrested. Many nonviolence
trainings were held that winter, in preparation for a planned mass
occupation the next spring.

On 30 April 1977, some 2,400 people convened at Seabrook. No one was
allowed to participate unless they belonged to an affinity group. When a
drunk showed up and demanded to join, the participants nonviolently
“hugged” him out. Entering the site, they set up different “villages”
where clusters of affinity groups camped. Each village had its own
spoke-council, comprised of one member from each affinity group,
designed to quickly reach a consensus-based decision once the police
arrived. The next morning, the participants woke up to see the National
Guard watching them. The governor arrived by helicopter. Activists were
informed that they would be given twenty minutes to leave, after which
anyone who stayed would be arrested. 1,401 people remained and were
arrested. Each affinity group had agreed that no one would pay bail, and
the protesters were released two weeks after their arrest. In most
cases, the charges were dismissed. The action “put the Clamshell on the
front pages of newspapers, especially in New England.”[^7]

The Clams decided to hold another mass occupation in June 1978. This
time, the fence surrounding the construction site was likely to be
locked.

A heated debate emerged within the Clamshell over whether or not to
bring wirecutting tools and cut through the fence. The “Hard Clams”,
which included the anarchist Boston-based Hard Rain affinity group and
the Vermont-based social ecologists, supported cutting the fence in
order to get onto the site. The “Soft Clams”, which included most of the
group's original founders and many pacifist-leaning anarchists, opposed
fence-cutting on the grounds that it would alienate supporters in local
communities. During contentious discussions, Hard Rain blocked any
agreement that would preclude cutting the fence. Frustrated, the Soft
Clams proposed modifying the decision-making process to require an 80%
consensus instead of a full 100% consensus. Many middle-ground
participants, who opposed fence-cutting, were suspicious at the Soft
Clams' attempts to exercise control and saw modified consensus as an
unfair way of shutting out the Hard Clams' opinions. The modification
never passed, and the Clamshell never reached consensus about whether
they'd cut the fence.[^8]

In the spring of 1978, the attorney general and governor proposed that
the Clamshell hold a legal demonstration on the Seabrook site on an
agreed-upon weekend. The Clamshell's “Coordinating Committee”, a
spoke-council that “was regarded as simply expressing the accumulated
will of the various local groups—violated the consensus process in order
to agree to the legal demonstration and preclude fence-cutting. Through
an 'armtwisting type of consensus,' the Coordinating Committee put
spokes under heavy pressure to vote against the will of their affinity
groups. Epstein writes that “the Clamshell as a whole was crumbling”.
About twenty thousand people attended the legal demonstration. In
Washington D.C., Clamshell held a sit-in at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which ended with an announcement that the construction would
be temporarily halted.[^9]

Disillusioned by the Coordinating Committee's betrayal of the affinity
groups, a number of anarchists, including Bookchin and the Vermont-based
social ecologists, formed a caucus called Clams for Democracy and
organized a conference at Hampshire College to propose a new
constitution for the Alliance. The proposed constitution, drafted by
Bookchin, eliminated the Coordinating Committee's power over affinity
groups, declared a general opposition to social hierarchy, and rejected
the pacifist dogmatism that prevented cutting the fence. Social
ecologist Brian Tokar recalls, "We said, ‘We’re going to cut the
fence.’"[^10] They were unable to persuade the Alliance as a whole.

The Hard Clams and other anarchists formed a group, Clams for Direct
Action at Seabrook (CDAS). Two thousand people showed up to their first
attempted occupation. Police stood inside the fence waiting for them to
cut it. Some demonstrators did cut the fence, but no one dared to enter.
Instead, protesters circled around the fence and then left. Five hundred
people came to CDAS' second attempted occupation.[^11]

Public Service Company finished building Seabrook's first unit in 1986,
and the plant became fully operational in 1990. Construction costs
approached \$7 billion. During construction, the company incurred a
large debt, leading to its bankruptcy. Today, NextEra operates the
plant.[^12]

Barbara Epstein argues that the Hard Clams underestimated the strategic
importance on symbolic protest and middle class support. The Hard Clams'
own militant strategy would have required a much larger movement, like
the one in Germany. Epstein contends that the Soft Clams understood
this, but could not implement it without violating the Alliance's
consensus process. Epstein compares Clamshell unfavourably to the
Abalone Alliance in California. Abalone modelled itself Clamshell, but
it also fostered a much deeper cultural commitment to revolutionary
nonviolence, thanks chiefly to the group's anarcha-feminists. As a
result, it avoided the kind of divisive debates that tore apart
Clamshell. [^13]

## Abalone Alliance

Modelled after the Clamshell Alliance, the Abalone Alliance formed to
prevent construction of PG&E's Diablo Canyon plant on the central
Californian coast. Abalone lasted much longer than Clamshell did, and
Abalone's 1981 occupation coincided with (and possibly contributed to) a
multi-year delay of the plant's construction. Epstein attributes the
alliance's success to a strong movement culture of revolutionary
nonviolence and feminism:

> The Abalone sustained itself better than the Clamshell partly by
> adopting some changes in the consensus process, but chiefly because it
> created a much more explicitly defined movement culture linking
> nonviolence and revolutionary aspirations through commitment to
> feminism and prefigurative politics. It was the anarchist contingent
> in the Abalone Alliance, the activists who called themselves
> anarcha-feminists, who were most responsible for developing this
> culture\[...\]The argument that feminism required revolutionary
> nonviolence gave nonviolence a legitimacy that was hard to challenge
> and that undermined the association between revolution and a
> willingness to engage in violence.[^14]

Abalone made decisions by consensus, and at a statewide conference in
1981, Abalone modified its process. From then on, a “block” could not
come from an individual but only from a group, and only if the group
reached consensus internally.[^15]

Like Clamshell, Abalone organized a series of escalating actions at the
construction site. On 7 August 1977, some 1,500 people rallied at
Diablo, and 47 people, most of them locals, were arrested for occupying
the site. On August 6 and 7 of the next year, 5,000 people rallied and
487 were arrested. Abalone had been planning a rally for April 1979,
when the Three Mile Island incident occurred a few days before. Some
25,000 people attended the rally. Abalone grew quickly, reaching sixty
local groups. 40,000 attended a the alliance's rally at Diablo on June
30.[^16]

2,100 protesters began a blockade of Diablo on 15 September 1981. Some
stayed by the gate. They were arrested immediately. Others hiked through
the woods trying to get to the plant itself. In some cases, they avoided
arrest for several days. Other protesters arrived by a fleet of ships,
and they were arrested when they landed at the shore. Meanwhile, at the
main camp, people did support work and rested. Some got out of jail,
rested at the main camp, and then went back to join the blockade again.
Two weeks into the blockade, over 1,900 arrests had been made. On
September 27, the camp packed up. As the camp ended, a plant supervisor
noticed a flaw in the blueprint. Certain pipes were duplicates and
should have been mirror images. The reapirs would be costly, so the
plant's operation was put on hold. Many protesters attributed the
blockade for the supervisor's double-checking.[^17]

The Abalone Alliance faded away after the September blockade. Some went
on to work with the Livermore Action Group, which campaigned against a
nuclear weapons-producing facility. The Diablo Canyon plant finally
opened in 1985.

## Effects

David Graeber, in “The Shock of Victory,” argues that even though
Clamshell and Abalone failed to stop their specifically targeted power
plants from being built, they nonetheless succeeded in destabilizing the
entire nuclear power industry. Graeber contends, “The actions did
delegitimize the very idea of nuclear power – raising public awareness
to the point that when Three Mile Island melted down in 1979, it doomed
the industry forever. While plans for Seabrook and Diablo Canyon might
not have been cancelled, just about every other then-pending plan to
build a nuclear reactor was, and no new ones have been proposed for a
quarter century.”[^18]

In *Strange Victories*, the autonomous Marxist group Midnight Notes
argues that the US anti-nuclear movement should have reached out more
systematically to the urban poor and focused on energy prices in
addition to ecological issues. Anti-nuclear struggles in Europe, they
observe, involved a much greater proletarian participation and thus had
more of a direct effect on the nuclear industry. The authors credit the
anti-nuclear victories of America and Europe in part to cultural shifts
and a decline of workers' discipline in the 1960s and 1970s:

> The high capital-intensity and the centralized existence of nuclear
> capital require stable, socially settled “family men”, “militarily”
> disciplined workers, truly “scientific” Stachanovites of the
> second-half of the century\[...\]The sixties and the seventies put
> this “new” worker in crisis. Wives, mothers and lovers no longer
> produced stability and discipline, the universities didn't produce
> reliability, while academic unemployment ruined the “pride” of these
> workers. *As this disillusioned, cynical, unstable intellectual
> proletariat emerges, the future of such capital-intensive industries
> like the nuclear industry is endangered.*[^19]

Midnight Notes later assessed: "Energy prices were key to expanding the
class composition of the movement and so it proved. The explosion of
struggles against energy price hikes in the streets and highways of the
U.S. (as well as revolutions and insurrections in oil-producing
countries) in 1979-80 forced capital to stabilize energy prices. This
sealed the doom of the U.S. nuclear industry in this century at
least."[^20]
