philosophy and is widely considered the "father of anarchism".[^1] He
was the first person to publicly declare himself an *anarchist*,[^2] and
remains one of anarchism's most influential theorists. Proudhon's famous
assertion that "<a href="property_is_theft.md" class="wikilink"
title="property is theft">property is theft</a>" appeared in his
groundbreaking 1840 work *<a href="What_Is_Property?.md" class="wikilink"

capitalist property relations and state socialism.

Proudhon described the

pursued as the synthesis of community and individualism. His mutualism

## Family

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was born in Besançon at 23 Rue du Petit Battant
in the suburb of Battant.[^3] His father Claude-François Proudhon worked
as a brewer and cooper, originally from the village of Chasnans near the
Swiss border. His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron.

Claude-François and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died
at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were
born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained very close
relationships with Proudhon throughout his life.[^4]

## Early Life

### Childhood and Education

As a boy, Proudhon mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic
agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside.
Although he received no formal education as a child, his mother taught
him to read, and he was spelling words by age three. The only books
Proudhon encountered until age ten were the Gospels and the Four Aymon
Brothers along with some local almanacs.

In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the
city college in Besançon. The family was far too poor to afford the
tuition, but with help from one of Claude-François' former employers,
she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the
cost. Proudhon was unable to afford basic things like books or shoes to
attend school, which caused him great difficulties and often made him
the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. Despite this, Proudhon
showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library
exploring a variety of subjects in his free time.[^5]

### The Printing Trade

In 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the
house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he
transferred to a press in Besançon owned by the family of one of his
schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier.[^6]

Besançon was an important center of religious thought at the time and
most of the works published at Gauthier were ecclesiastical works.
During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading
this Christian literature and began to question many of his long-held
religious beliefs, which eventually led him to reject Christianity
altogether.[^7]

Over the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press,
proofreading publications. By 1829, he had become more interested in
social issues than in religious theory. Of particular importance during
this period was his encounter with
<a href="Charles_Fourier.md" class="wikilink"
title="Charles Fourier">Charles Fourier</a>, who in 1829 came to
Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work *Le Nouveau Monde
Industriel et Sociétaire*. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book,
which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of
social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong
impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life.[^8]

It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest
friendships with Gustave Fallot, a scholar from Montebéliard who came
from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's
corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his
friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings
together discussing French literature by Michel de Montaigne, François
Rabelais, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, Denis Diderot and many other
authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of
theological readings.[^9]

### Turn to Philosophy

In September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a journeyman compositor.
The period following this was marked by unemployment and poverty, with
Proudhon travelling around France where he unsuccessfully sought stable
employment in printing and as a schoolteacher.[^10]

During this period, Fallot offered financial assistance to Proudhon if
he came to Paris to study philosophy. Proudhon accepted his offer
despite concerns about how it might disrupt his career in the printing
trade.[^11] He walked from Besançon to Paris, arriving in March at the
Rue Mazarin in the Latin Quarter, where Fallot was living at the time.

Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars
surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst
people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate.
Ultimately, Proudhon found that he preferred to spend the majority of
his time studying alone and was not fond of urban life, longing to
return home to Besançon.[^12]

The cholera outbreak in Paris granted him his wish as Fallot was struck
with the illness, making him unable to financially support Proudhon any
longer. After Proudhon left, he never saw Fallot (who died in 1836)
again.[^13] However, this friendship was one of the most important
events in Proudhon's life as it motivated him to leave the printing
trade and pursue his studies of philosophy instead.[^14]

After an unsuccessful printing business venture in 1838, Proudhon
decided to dedicate himself fully to scholarly pursuits. He applied for
the Suard Pension, a bursary that would enable him to study at the
Academy of Besançon. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates
primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others
and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of
education he had given himself while working as an artisan. Proudhon
arrived in Paris towards the end of autumn in 1838.[^15]

## Adulthood

### Early Revolutionary Writings

In 1839, the Academy of Besançon held an essay competition on the
subject of the utility of the celebration of Sunday regarding hygiene,
morality and the relationship of the family and the city. Proudhon's
entry, titled *De la Célébration du dimanche*, essentially used the
essay subject as a pretext for discussing a variety of political and
philosophical ideas and in it one can find the seeds of his later
revolutionary ideas. Many of his ideas on authority, morality and
property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only
awarded the bronze medal, something in which Proudhon took pride because
he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics
uncomfortable.[^16]

In 1840, Proudhon published his first major work
*<a href="What_Is_Property?.md" class="wikilink"
title="What Is Property?">What Is Property?</a>* (*Qu'est-ce que la
propriété?*). This groundbreaking work attracted the attention of the
French authorities and the scrutiny of
<a href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>,
who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each
other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there.

His third memoir on property was a letter to the Fourierist writer
Considérant, published in 1842 under the title *Warning to Proprietors*.
Proudhon was tried for it at Besançon, but he was acquitted when the
jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they
themselves could not understand.[^17]

In 1846, he published the *Système des contradictions économiques ou
Philosophie de la misère* (*The System of Economic Contradictions, or
The Philosophy of Poverty*) which prompted a book-length critique from
Karl Marx entitled *The Poverty of Philosophy*, commencing a rift
between anarchism and Marxism that would be continued by the Bakuninists
and collectivist anarchists in the
<a href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a> and that continues
to this day.[^18]

### Revolutionary Activity

For some time, Proudhon ran a small printing establishment at Besançon,
but without success. Afterwards, he became connected as a kind of
manager with a commercial firm in Lyon, France. In 1847, he left this
job and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated
as a leader of innovation. In this year, he also became a
Freemason.[^19]

Proudhon became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution
of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist.[^20]

Proudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849
and 1850 with the French Liberal School economist Frédéric Bastiat
discussing the legitimacy of interest. Proudhon famously lost his temper
and declared to Bastiat: "Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has
never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do
not hear anything, you do not understand anything."[^21]

After the death of his follower
<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, Proudhon's libertarian
socialism diverged into individualist anarchism, collectivist anarchism,
anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, with notable proponents such
as Carlo Cafiero, Joseph Déjacque, Peter Kropotkin and Benjamin Tucker.

### Influence on Spanish Anarchism

In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal *El
Porvenir* in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's
ideas.[^22] Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the
principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish[^23] and later
briefly became President of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the
Federal Democratic Republican Party.

According to George Woodcock, these translations were to have a profound
and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870,
but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already
provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which
sprang up in the early 1860s.[^24] According to the *Encyclopædia
Britannica*, during the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi i Margall
attempted to establish a decentralized, or 'cantonalist,' political
system on Proudhonian lines.[^25]

### Personal Life

Proudhon's personal life was marked by financial struggles and political
persecution. He unsuccessfully tried to create a national bank, to be
funded by what became an abortive attempt at an income tax on
capitalists and shareholders. Similar in some respects to a credit
union, it would have given interest-free loans.[^26]

Proudhon's relationship with Karl Marx began cordially but eventually
soured. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's
*The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty*
with the provocatively titled *The Poverty of Philosophy*. The dispute
became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and Marxist
wings of the International Working Men's Association.[^27]

Despite their personal diatribes, Marx always maintained a certain
respect for Proudhon. In his obituary of Proudhon which was written on
24 January 1865, almost two decades after *The Poverty of Philosophy*,
Marx called *What Is Property?* "epoch-making".[^28]

## Death

Proudhon died in Passy on 19 January 1865 and was buried in Paris at
Montparnasse cemetery.[^29]

## Anarchist Philosophy

### First to Claim the Name

Proudhon was the first person known to refer to himself as an
"anarchist".[^30][^31] Proudhon's anarchist mutualism is considered as a
middle way or synthesis between individualist anarchism and social
anarchism. According to Larry Gambone, Proudhon was a "social
individualist anarchist".[^32]

Both anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin and individualist anarchist
Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as "the no-government form of
socialism" and "the abolition of the State and the abolition of usury",
respectively. In this, Kropotkin and Tucker were following the
definition of Proudhon, who stated that we do not admit the government
of man by man any more than the exploitation of man by man.[^33]

### Definition of Anarchy

In *What Is Property?*, published in 1840, Proudhon defined *anarchy* as
"the absence of a master, of a sovereign" and wrote that as man seeks
justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy.[^34]

In 1849, Proudhon declared in *Confessions of a Revolutionary* that
whoever lays his hand on me to govern me is a usurper and tyrant, and I
declare him my enemy.[^35]

### Critique of Government

Proudhon was critical of state authority and supported freedom of
religion, speech, and assembly.[^36] In *The General Idea of the
Revolution* (1851), Proudhon urged a "society without authority". In a
subchapter called "What is Government?", Proudhon wrote his famous
denunciation:

*To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed,
law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at,
controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by
creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do
so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction
noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered,
assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden,
reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility,
and in the name of the general interest, to be place\[d\] under
contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from,
squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first
word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted
down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged,
condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all,
mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government;
that is its justice; that is its morality.*[^37]

### Evolution of Thought

Towards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier
views. In *The Principle of Federation* (1863), Proudhon modified his
earlier anti-state position, arguing for "the balancing of authority by
liberty" and put forward a decentralized "theory of federal government".
Proudhon also defined anarchy differently as "the government of each by
himself" which meant "that political functions have been reduced to
industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but
transactions and exchanges".

This work also saw Proudhon call his economic system an "agro-industrial
federation", arguing that it would provide specific federal arrangements
to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and
financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside and so stop
the re-introduction of wage labour. This was because political right
requires to be buttressed by economic right.

In the posthumously published *Theory of Property*, Proudhon argued that
"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the
State". Hence, Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and
at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the
constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the
same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark
against the ever-encroaching power of the State.[^38]

## Economic Philosophy

### Mutualism

Proudhon adopted the term *mutualism* for his brand of anarchism and
socialism which involved control of the means of production by the
workers. In his vision, self-employed artisans, peasants and
cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon,
factories and other large workplaces would be run by "labor
associations" operating on directly democratic principles. The state
would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a
federation of "free communes".

In 1863, Proudhon wrote: "All my economic ideas as developed over
twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial
federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula:
political federation or decentralization".[^39]

Proudhon called this use-ownership possession (*possession*) and this
economic system mutualism (*mutualisme*), having many arguments against
entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality,
economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that
it enabled profit which in turn led to social instability and war by
creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor
to pay them off. Another was that it produced despotism and turned
workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss.

### Free Association

For Proudhon, mutualism involved free association by creating industrial
democracy, a system where workplaces would be handed over to
democratically organised workers' associations. We want these
associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the
pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven
into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic.[^40]

Under mutualism, workers would no longer sell their labour to a
capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives. Proudhon
urged workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal
conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism. This
would result in capitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped
everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange
guaranteed.[^41]

As Robert Graham notes, Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly
linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers'
self-management.[^42] K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis
of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that Proudhon consistently advanced a
program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction
of the economy to the workers. For Proudhon, strong workers'
associations would enable the workers to determine jointly by election
how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day
basis.[^43]

### Dialectical Method

In *What Is Property?*, Proudhon moved on from the rejection of
communism and private property in a dialectical manner, looking for a
"third form of society. This third form of society, the synthesis of
communism and property, we will call liberty."[^44]

In his *System of Economic Contradiction*, Proudhon described mutuality
as "the synthesis of the notions of private property and collective
ownership."[^45]

Proudhon's rejection of compulsory communism and privileged property led
him towards a synthesis of libertarian communism and possession, just as
the apparent contradiction between his theories of property represents
an antithesis which still needs synthesizing. Proudhon stated that in
presenting the "property is liberty" theory, he is not changing his mind
about the earlier "property is theft" definition. Proudhon did not only
rely on "synthesis", but also emphasized "balance" between approaches
such as communism and property that apparently cannot be fully
reconciled.

### Property is Theft

Proudhon saw the privileged property as a form of government that was
necessarily backed by and interlinked with the state, writing that the
private property of privilege called forth and commanded the State and
arguing that since the first related to the landowner and capitalist
whose ownership derived from conquest or exploitation and was only
maintained through the state, its property laws, police and army.

Hence, Proudhon distinguished between personal property, possessions
(*possession*) and private property (*propriété*), i.e. productive
property while the former having direct use-value to the individual
possessing it. Unlike capitalist property supporters, Proudhon stressed
equality and thought that all workers should own property and have
access to capital, stressing that in every cooperative every worker
employed in the association must have an undivided share in the property
of the company.[^46]

When saying that "property is theft", Proudhon was referring to the
landowner or capitalist who he believed "stole" the profits from
laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was subordinated,
exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience.[^47]

In *What Is Property?*, Proudhon also wrote:

*Property is physically and mathematically impossible.*

*Property is impossible, because it demands something for nothing.*

*Property is impossible because wherever it exists production costs more
than it is worth.*

*Property is impossible, because, with a given capital, production is
proportional to labor, not to property.*

*Property is impossible, because it is homicide.*[^48]

### Property is Freedom

In asserting that property is freedom, Proudhon was referring not only
to the product of an individual's labor, but also to the peasant or
artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by
selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property
is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that
is not.

Proudhon advocated workers' self-management and was opposed to the
private ownership of the means of production. In 1848, Proudhon wrote:

*Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to
the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality. We
are socialists under universal association, ownership of the land and of
the instruments of labour is social ownership. We want the mines,
canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers'
associations. We want these associations to be models for agriculture,
industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of
companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the
democratic and social Republic.*[^49]

### Social Ownership

While favoring individual ownership for small-property holdings,
Proudhon advocated social ownership and worker cooperatives or similar
workers' associations and workers' councils. Proudhon advocated
industrial democracy and repeatedly argued for the socialization of the
means of production and of land. In *What Is Property?*, Proudhon wrote
that land is indispensable to our existence, consequently a common
thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation.

In a letter to Louis Blanqui in 1841, Proudhon wrote that all capital,
whether material or mental, being the result of collective labour, is,
in consequence, collective property.

In his election manifesto for the 1848 French Constituent Assembly
election, Proudhon wrote:

*For this value or wealth, produced by the activity of all, is by the
very fact of its creation collective wealth, the use of which, like that
of the land, may be divided, but which as property remains undivided. In
short, property in capital is indivisible, and consequently inalienable,
not necessarily when the capital is uncreated, but when it is common or
collective. \[T\]his non-appropriation of the instruments of production
I, in accordance with all precedent, call a destruction of property. In
fact, without the appropriation of instruments, property is nothing.*

## Opposition to War and Nationalism

Proudhon opposed dictatorship, militarism, nationalism and war, arguing
that the end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century,
under pain of indefinite decadence[^50] and that the workers alone are
capable of putting an end to war by creating economic equilibrium. This
presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals.[^51]

As Robert L. Hoffman notes, *War and Peace* ends by condemning war
without reservation and its conclusion is that war is obsolete.[^52]

Proudhon argued that under mutualism there will no longer be
nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words:
they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he
may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an
acquired right.[^53]

## Revolution and Socialism

### Revolutionary Transformation

While Proudhon identified as a revolutionary, his idea of revolution did
not entail civil war or violent upheaval, but rather the transformation
of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and
demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was
monetary reform, combined with organizing a credit bank and workers
associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about
the organization of society along new lines.

About the 1848 French Revolution and the Second French Republic,
Proudhon took a radical stance regarding the National Workshops,
criticized for being charity whilst criticizing the June Days Uprising
for using violence. Proudhon's criticism of the February Revolution was
that it was "without an idea" and considered some parts of the
revolution too moderate and others too radical.

### Dual Power

Although the revolutionary concept of dual power was first used by
Vladimir Lenin, it was conceptually first outlined by Proudhon.
According to Murray Bookchin, Proudhon made the bright suggestion, in
his periodical *Le Représentant du peuple* (28 April 1848), that the
mass democracy of the clubs could become a popular forum where the
social agenda of the revolution could be prepared for use by the
Constituent Assembly—a proposal that would essentially have defused the
potency of the clubs as a potentially rebellious dual power.[^54]

### Socialist Identity

Proudhon self-identified as a socialist, and remains widely recognized
as such.[^55][^56][^57]

As one of the first theorists of libertarian socialism, Proudhon opposed
state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers
themselves in associations. Proudhon was one of the main influences on
the theory of workers' self-management (*autogestion*) in the late 19th
and 20th century.

Proudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by
capitalists or the state, arguing in *What Is Property?* that while
property in product does not carry with it property in the means of
production,[^58] the right to product is exclusive and the right to
means is common.

Proudhon applied this to the land (the land is a common thing)[^59] and
workplaces (all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be
its exclusive proprietor).[^60] Proudhon argued that while society owned
the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under
supervision from society) with the organising of regulating societies in
order to regulate the market.[^61]

### Critique of Authoritarian Socialism

Proudhon made no public criticism of Karl Marx or Marxism because in
Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after
Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he
criticized authoritarian and state socialists of his period. This
included the French socialist Louis Blanc, of whom Proudhon said that
you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must
have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy,
distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority,
your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative
mystifications.

It was Proudhon's book *What Is Property?* that convinced the young Marx
that private property should be abolished. In *The Holy Family*, one of
his first works, Marx stated: "Not only does Proudhon write in the
interest of the proletarians, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier.
His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat."

However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published a
vicious criticism of Proudhon. Marx wrote *The Poverty of Philosophy* as
a refutation of Proudhon's *The Philosophy of Poverty*. In their
letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on
revolution, stating: "I believe we have no need of it in order to
succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary
action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would
simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a
contradiction."[^62]

More than Proudhon's anarchism, Marx did take issue with what he saw as
Proudhon's misunderstanding of the relationship between labor, value and
price as well as believing that Proudhon's attack on bourgeois property
was framed in terms of bourgeois ethics rather than transcending these
ethics altogether.

Anarchists, among others, have since criticized Marx and Marxists for
having distorted Proudhon's views. Iain McKay argues that Marx took many
concepts such as his criticism of private property, scientific socialism
and surplus value from Proudhon. Similarly, Rudolf Rocker argued that we
find 'the theory of surplus value, that grand 'scientific discovery' of
which our Marxists are so proud of, in the writings of Proudhon.

In spite of their personal diatribes, Marx always maintained a certain
respect for Proudhon, although this did not stop Marx from expelling
Proudhon's follower Mikhail Bakunin (in spite of his criticism of
Proudhon) and his supporters from the First International.

## Legacy and Influence

### Impact on Anarchism

Proudhon's influence on the anarchist movement cannot be overstated. As
the first person to publicly claim the name "anarchist" and develop a
comprehensive anarchist philosophy, he laid the groundwork for all
subsequent anarchist theory. His ideas on workers' self-management, free
association, and federalism became central tenets of anarchist thought.

In the United States, Proudhon was influential within radical
progressive sectors and labour leaders, among them individualist
anarchists such as Joseph Labadie, Dyer Lum and Benjamin Tucker. In
France, Proudhon's influence on French socialism, including the Paris
Commune, was surpassed by Marxist socialism only at the beginning of the
20th century.

Proudhonists made up an important French faction in the First
International and Proudhon's thought strongly influenced debate in
French and Belgian socialist circles long before attempts by
reactionaries to co-opt his name.

### Workers' Self-Management

Proudhon's advocacy for workers' associations and cooperatives operating
on directly democratic principles became a foundational concept for the
workers' self-management (*autogestion*) movement. His vision of
factories run by labor associations where workers determine jointly by
election how the enterprise is to be directed and operated on a
day-to-day basis inspired generations of anarchists and syndicalists.

His ideas directly influenced the development of anarcho-syndicalism and
the revolutionary union movements of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. The concept of industrial democracy that Proudhon championed
remains relevant to contemporary anarchist organizing.

### Federalism

Proudhon's theory of federalism offered an alternative to both
centralized state power and chaotic individualism. His vision of a
federation of free communes, where society would be organized from the
bottom up through voluntary association, influenced federalist movements
throughout Europe and beyond.

His 1863 work *The Principle of Federation* outlined a decentralized
theory of federal government that would balance authority with liberty,
providing specific federal arrangements to protect people from
capitalist and financial feudalism. This federalist vision became
central to anarchist conceptions of social organization.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Personal Prejudices

While Proudhon made enormous contributions to anarchist theory, it is
important to acknowledge his personal failings. His private notebooks
reveal deeply problematic views, including antisemitism and extreme
patriarchal attitudes toward women. In 1847, he considered publishing an
article against Jewish people, which he said he "hated".[^63]

However, as Iain McKay notes, racism was never the basis of Proudhon's
political thinking and anti-Semitism formed no part of Proudhon's
revolutionary programme.[^64] Proudhon himself wrote: "There will no
longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of
the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or
colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is
everywhere an acquired right."[^65]

### Anti-Feminism

Proudhon expressed strongly patriarchal views on women's nature and
their proper role in the family and society at large. In his *Carnets*
(*Notebooks*), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a
woman's choice was to be "courtesan or housekeeper". His justification
for patriarchy was men's assumed greater physical strength.

Proudhon's defense of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his
lifetime; libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque attacked Proudhon's
anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles. Déjacque
directed Proudhon either to 'speak out against man's exploitation of
woman' or 'do not describe yourself as an anarchist'.[^66]

These patriarchal views stand in stark contradiction to Proudhon's own
libertarian and egalitarian ideas and are rightly rejected by
contemporary anarchists. Modern anarchism recognizes that true
liberation must include the liberation of all people regardless of
gender, and Proudhon's failure on this point remains a significant stain
on his legacy.

### Misuse by the Right

After Proudhon's death, various right-wing movements attempted to claim
his legacy. The *Cercle Proudhon*, a right-wing association formed in
1911 by Georges Valois and Edouard Berth, attempted to synthesize
Proudhon's mutualism with Charles Maurras' integralist nationalism. In
1925, Georges Valois founded the Faisceau, the first fascist league.

However, as K. Steven Vincent states, to argue that Proudhon was a
proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's
writings.[^67]

Proudhon had great influence on the anarchist and non-anarchist
socialist movement, and his thought strongly influenced debate in
anarchist circles. George Woodcock stated that those who attempted to
use Proudhon for reactionary purposes had no direct connection with the
anarchist movement and were repudiated by it.[^68]

A number of Proudhon scholars have explicitly rejected the idea that
Proudhon could reasonably be considered a fascist. His advocacy for
federalism and his critique of nationalism and caesarism put him clearly
at odds with fascist ideology.
