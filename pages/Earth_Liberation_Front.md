## Overview

The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) is an international movement of
autonomous affinity groups that engage in sabotage against
environmentally destructive industries. Beginning in the UK in 1992, it
spread throughout Europe at first and then to the United States in 1996.
In the mid to late 2010s, ELF cells have taken action in countries such
as Chile, Mexico, Iran, Turkey, and Russia, often in collaboration with
the "<a   href="Animal_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">"Animal Liberation Front</a> (ALF) and
"<a   href="Informal_Anarchist_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Informal Anarchist Federation">"Informal Anarchist Federation</a>
(FAI).

ELF actions have taken place in "Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia,
Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia,
Sweden and the UK" as well as the United States.[^1]

In 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that the ELF had
committed over 1,200 actions and cost companies tens of millions of
dollars in damages[^2] (By 2004, "extreme animal rights and
environmental activists" had caused over \$100 million according to the
Anti-Defamation League[^3]). The ELF's 1997 *Beltane* communique begins,
"Welcome to the struggle of all species to be free. We are the burning
rage of this dying planet." The declaration endorses both
"<a   href="Social_Ecology.md" class="wikilink" title="social ecology">"social
ecology</a> and deep ecology, and it says, "We take inspiration from
Luddites, Diggers, the Autonome squatter movement, the A.L.F., the
Zapatistas, and the little people--those mischievous elves of lore.
Authorities can't see us because they don't believe in elves. We are
practically invisible. We have no command structure, no spokespersons,
no office, just many small groups working separately, seeking vulnerable
targets and practicing our craft."[^4]

The ELF has never harmed a human being in any of their actions.[^5] In
March 2001, the Property Rights Foundation of America reported that the
FBI ranked the ELF as the United States' top domestic "terror"
threat.[^6] In 2005, the FBI's deputy assistant director, singling out
the ELF in particular, described "the eco-terrorism, animal rights
movement" as "\[t\]he No. 1 domestic terrorism threat."[^7] In *How
Nonviolence Protects the State*, Peter Gelderloos points to the FBI's
classification of the network as evidence that the ELF is a relatively
effective threat to the state.[^8]

# Structure and Guidelines

Each cell of the ELF operates autonomously and separately from the
others. ELF cells anonymously send communiques to the above-ground Press
Office, which publicizes and explains the underground actions. All ELF
cells follow certain guidelines:

> Any direct action taken to halt ecological destruction whilst keeping
> to the following guidelines could, if claimed as such, be considered
> an ELF action.
>
> - To inflict maximum economic damage on those profiting from the
>   destruction and exploitation of the natural environment.
> - To reveal and educate the public about the atrocities committed
>   against the earth and all species that populate it.
> - To take all necessary precautions against harming any animal - human
>   and nonhuman.
>
> There is no way to contact the E.L.F. in your area. It is up to each
> committed person to take responsibility for stopping the exploitation
> of the natural world. No longer can it be assumed that someone else is
> going to do it. If not you who, if not now when?[^9]

# Origins in Europe

The ELF, or the "Elves", first formed in Brighton, United Kingdom in
1992, at a national gathering of Earth First!ers. Fashioning themselves
after the "<a   href="Animal_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">"Animal Liberation Front</a>, the ELF
went on to use militant tactics to help out Earth First! campaigns. For
instance, "during British Earth First!'s Mahogany Means Murder campaign
of the early 1990s, Elves would mingle in with the EF! activists and
whilst the EF! activists dropped their banners and blockaded the
premises, the Elves would be busy gluing the locks of the building that
the EF! activists were occupying."[^10]

The ELF spread throughout Europe at first. Neil Molland summarizes:

> "To name just some of the early actions, the ELF in Holland targeted
> Amsterdam Airport, damaged cars, destroyed hunting platforms, and
> attacked oil exploration equipment. In a German forest near Frankfurt,
> Elves damaged dredgers being used to destroy the forest in preparation
> for urban expansion, while elsewhere in Germany activists targeted
> McDonald's restaurants, hunting platforms, and neo-Nazi political
> groups."[^11]

# United States

## Eugene, Oregon cell

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Eugene, Oregon cell of the ELF caused
major economic damage to various industries, attracting high-profile
attention from the media and the government.

The ELF spread to the United States in 1996, when Josephine Sunshine
Overaker and her boyfriend set fire to a U.S. Forest Service truck and
spray-painted a circle-A and "Stop raping our forests" on the side of
the rangers' station in Detroit, Oregon. On the 30th, she and two others
burned down the Oakridge Ranger Station,[^12] causing about \$5 million
in damages.[^13]

On 21 July 1997, the cell burned down the Cavel West horse
slaughterhouse. Before setting fire, the Elves set about four hundred
horses back into the wild. After the arson, the facility never opened
again.[^14] On 19 October 1998, the group executed its most famous
action, an arson at Vail, Colorado's ski resort which threatened lynx
habitat. The fire caused at least \$12 million in damages, and grand
jury sources suggest it was more than twice that amount.[^15]
Journalists Sara Burnett and Will Potter have said the arson caused
close to \$26 million in damages.[^16]

The cell's other arsons damaged the headquarters of U.S. Forest
Industries, Boise Cascade and Superior Lumber, a Eugene police station,
biotech research facilities at the University of Washington, 35 SUVs at
Eugene's Romania Chevrolet Truck Center, and a Bureau of Land Management
wild horse corral. The cell also attacked a meat company in Eugene and
signed the action as the
"<a   href="Animal_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">"Animal Liberation Front</a>: "As long as
companies continue to operate and profit off of Mother Earth and Her
sentient beings, the Animal Liberation Front will continue to target
these operations and their insurance companies until they are out of
business."[^17]

According to McGowan, the group moved too quickly and made significant
tactical mistakes, for example when they set a fire at the University of
Washington that got out of control and destroyed a library in addition
to their target. McGowan opposed his cell's attack on an SUV dealer,
since he worried it would compromise the legal situation of Jeff "Free"
Luers and Craig "Critter" Marshall, who were then being tried for
setting fire to SUVs. McGowan says that at his cell's last meeting, the
group split irreparably apart as some members appalled the rest by
bringing up the idea of targeting individuals in addition to property.
The cell fell apart, and McGowan moved to Canada and then New York.[^18]

The federal government launched a major investigation called "Operation
Backlash" to catch ELF militants and others they deemed
"eco-terrorists". For three years after the actions, the federal agents
had no evidence or significant leads, but they came to suspect Jake
Ferguson, known for his militant posture in Eugene's environmental
scene. Although they had no evidence against Ferguson, they led him to
think they did and thus scared him into cooperating. He wore a wire and
obtained evidence against other members of the group. Ultimately, 8
co-defendants cooperated with the government, while 4 others, including
McGowan, refused. McGowan plead guilty in 2006 and was sentenced to 7
years in prison.[^19]

Dibee was extradited by the Cuban government to the United States, and
in 2022 he plead guilty to involvement in ELF arsons.[^20] As of 2022,
Overaker remains the only one member who was never caught. Her
whereabouts are unknown.

# 2010s

In 2014, an Iranian cell spray-painted "ELF" and a circle-A next to a
critique of the cutting down of two old-growth trees in the city of
Sabzevar. The same year, attacks on excavators in Russia and Turkey were
each signed by the "ELF/FAI/IRF." FAI referred to the
"<a   href="Informal_Anarchist_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Informal Anarchist Federation">"Informal Anarchist Federation</a>
and IRF stood for "International Revolutionary Front." Later that year,
a U.K. attack on luxury and corporate cars was signed by "F.A.I. Torches
in the Night -Earth Liberation Front."[^22]

In 2015, a Mexican cell attacked a Honda dealership and released a
statement declaring, "Once again, tired of their artificial world we
have acted to demonstrate that we will never accept their offers to live
in this filthy puddle that is full of automatons filled with
indifference who do not show even the most minimal respect for the
Earth." In 2016, a group of ELF and
"<a   href="Animal_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">"Animal Liberation Front</a> cells
jointly took responsibility for a series of coordinated sabotages and
blockades around Chile against pharmacies, a butcher shop, a
slaughterhouse, a railroad, a bank, and a police station.[^23]

In 2017, Chilean ELF and ALF militants set off noise bombs in an Arauco
Forest Company truck.[^24] In 2018 ELF and ALF cells spray-painted a
Chilean police boat and launched banner drops and noise bombs against
the dairy and hydroelectric industries. The accompanying communique
expressed solidarity with
"<a   href="Mapuche.md" class="wikilink" title="Mapuche">"Mapuche</a>
resistance to hydroelectric dams.[^25]

# Criticism

*Unrepentant Marxist* blogger Louis Proyect writes, "In a novel, a well
placed firebomb might discourage a corporate despoiler but in the real
world, the businessmen will pay for the damages with insurance and
plunge ahead, making sure to make an amalgam between the underground
activists and those who are using mass action to protect the
environment."[^26] However, not all companies and facilities have
recovered from ELF actions; the Cavel West slaughterhouse was never
rebuilt, for example.[^27] Further addressing this line of criticism,
former ELF Press Office member Craig Rosebraugh argues that property
destruction is an excellent tool for public education, and that if it
were to be repeatedly applied to a single target, insurance companies
would raise their rates and eventually refuse to cover the company.[^28]
In other words, the only problem with ELF attacks was that there weren't
enough of them.

Rosebraugh has criticized the ELF's choice of targets. To Rosebraugh, it
was necessary to pick more powerful targets: a car manufacturer instead
of just a dealership, Monsanto instead of professors' offices, and most
of all the U.S. government itself.[^29]

The anonymous author of "The Telescope or the Kaleidoscope" criticizes
the ELF's nonviolence-inspired guidelines and urges a more
insurrectionary approach.[^30]

# Prisoners

Marius Mason is serving 22 years for ELF actions including a 1999 arson
of a GMO research office at Michigan State University and a 2000 arson
against logging equipment in Michigan.[^31]
