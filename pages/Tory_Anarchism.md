# Tory Anarchism

**Tory Anarchism** is a contradictory political and cultural stance that
emerged primarily in 20th century England, combining traditionalist
conservative cultural values with anti-authoritarian and anti-state
positions. The term was first coined by
"<a   href="George_Orwell.md" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">"George
Orwell</a> to describe both "<a   href="Jonathan_Swift.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jonathan Swift">"Jonathan Swift</a> and himself.[^1]

## Overview

Tory anarchism represents a peculiar tradition within English political
and cultural thought that defies conventional left-right categorization.
[^2] Its adherents are typically characterized as being "both a radical
and a traditionalist," embracing what appear to be fundamental
contradictions - defending traditional customs and manners while
maintaining a fierce hostility to state power and bureaucratic
authority.[^3]

The stance emerged against the backdrop of Britain's declining imperial
power and represents both a critique of modernity and capitalism while
paradoxically defending certain traditional hierarchical structures.
Tory anarchists are distinguished from orthodox anarchists by their lack
of interest in revolutionary politics or creating an alternative
society - instead, they adopt a contrarian stance that mocks all
political positions while defending an idealized vision of "Merry
England."[^4]

## Origins and Development

### Historical Context

The concept emerged during the 20th century as Britain transitioned from
imperial power to a more diminished global role. This context is crucial
to understanding tory anarchism as what Peter Wilkin describes as "both
an evocation of and a commentary upon the changing nature of English
identity over the course of the C20."[^5]

### Key Characteristics

According to various commentators, tory anarchists typically share
several traits:

- Defense of traditional customs, good manners, and proper grammar
- Respect for individual privacy and liberty
- Hostility to expanding state power and bureaucracy
- Ambivalent attitude toward the British class system - both celebrating
  and condemning it
- Anti-theoretical stance favoring empiricism over abstract reasoning
- Use of satire and irony as primary modes of cultural criticism[^6]

## Notable Figures

### George Orwell

Orwell described himself as a "Tory anarchist" until at least 1934,
despite his well-documented democratic socialist politics.[^7] His
biographer John Newsinger preferred the term "tory socialist" to capture
this contradiction. Orwell's tory anarchist tendencies manifested in his
defense of English customs and traditions, his suspicion of progressive
middle-class "cranks," and his conservative cultural attitudes despite
radical political views.[^8]

### Other Proposed Figures

Various writers and satirists have been identified as possible tory
anarchists, including:

- **Jonathan Swift** - identified by Orwell as the original tory
  anarchist
- **Evelyn Waugh** - combined savage social satire with reactionary
  Catholic conservatism
- **Peter Cook** - satirist who mocked the establishment while
  maintaining upper-class sensibilities
- **Chris Morris** - contemporary satirist critiquing media and popular
  culture
- **J.R.R. Tolkien** - who wrote in 1943: "My political opinions lean
  more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the
  abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)"[^9]

## Contemporary Interpretations

### Political Applications

Some modern writers have attempted to apply tory anarchist principles to
contemporary politics. Aris Roussinos suggests that radical localism and
devolution of power to parish councils could represent a practical
application of tory anarchist ideas, citing the Autonomous
Administration of Northeast Syria (Rojava) as an unlikely model.[^10]

### Tory Socialism

The related concept of "Tory socialism" shares some characteristics with
tory anarchism, particularly in its combination of social conservatism
with economic redistribution. Giles Fraser identifies this tradition
with figures like
"<a   href="John_Ruskin.md" class="wikilink" title="John Ruskin">"John
Ruskin</a> and
"<a   href="William_Morris.md" class="wikilink" title="William Morris">"William
Morris</a>, describing it as "socially conservative, economically
redistributive" with "liberalism in all its forms" as its enemy.[^11]

## Criticism

### Anarchist Critique

Orthodox anarchists have criticized the term as fundamentally
contradictory and historically inaccurate. The anarchist writer known as
"Anarcho" argues that genuine anarchism is incompatible with any form of
conservatism, as anarchism fundamentally opposes all hierarchies and
forms of domination. They note that historical anarchists were
explicitly revolutionary and anti-capitalist, positions incompatible
with tory values.[^12]

### Conceptual Problems

Critics point out several fundamental problems with the concept:

- The term conflates cultural conservatism with political anarchism in
  ways that may be intellectually incoherent
- It represents privileged individuals "rebelling" while maintaining
  their class positions
- The stance offers no coherent alternative to existing systems, only
  critique
- It may simply be contrarianism dressed up as political philosophy[^13]

## Cultural Impact

Despite its contradictions, tory anarchism has had significant impact on
British popular culture, particularly through satire. From Orwell's
*Animal Farm* to Chris Morris's *Brass Eye*, works in this tradition
have challenged both state power and social conformity while maintaining
a distinctly English sensibility. The tradition's emphasis on empiricism
over theory and its use of humor as a weapon against pomposity remain
influential in British cultural criticism.[^14]
