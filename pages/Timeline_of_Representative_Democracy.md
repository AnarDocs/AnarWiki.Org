# Timeline of Representative Democracy

This is a timeline of the introduction of
"<a   href="Representative_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">"representative democracy</a> in
"<a   href="List_of_States.md" class="wikilink" title="states">"states</a>
across the world. From an
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
perspective, representative democracy represents a system where
decision-making power is delegated to elected officials rather than
exercised directly by the people themselves, often serving to legitimize
"<a   href="State_(Polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> power
while maintaining hierarchical control.[^1]

## Early Representative Democracies (Before Universal Suffrage)

The following timeline includes states that established representative
democratic institutions even when suffrage was severely restricted by
property ownership, race, or gender - restrictions that anarchists view
as evidence of representative democracy's role in maintaining class and
social hierarchies rather than genuinely empowering all people.

- **1707**: The
  "<a   href="United_Kingdom.md" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">"United

## Timeline of Universal Suffrage

The following timeline tracks when countries achieved universal adult
suffrage - typically defined as the removal of property requirements,
racial restrictions, and gender-based voting exclusions. From an
anarchist perspective, the long struggle for universal suffrage
demonstrates how representative democracy initially served as a tool of
elite control, with the franchise gradually expanded through popular
struggle rather than through the benevolence of existing power
structures.

### Property Requirements Removed

## Anarchist Analysis

From an
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
perspective, this timeline illustrates several critical points about
representative democracy:

- **Gradual Expansion of the Franchise**: The extension of voting rights
  typically resulted from popular struggles and social movements rather
  than being freely granted by existing governments, suggesting that
  representative systems resist democratization unless forced to change.

<!-- -->

- **Exclusionary Origins**: Representative democracies were generally
  founded as systems of elite control, with property requirements,
  racial restrictions, and gender exclusions designed to concentrate
  political power in the hands of wealthy white men.

<!-- -->

- **Limitations of Electoral Politics**: Even with universal suffrage,
  anarchists argue that representative democracy maintains hierarchical
  power structures, with elected officials exercising authority over the
  population rather than the population exercising direct control over
  decisions affecting their lives.

<!-- -->

- **Alternative Models**: Anarchists advocate for
  "<a   href="Direct_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
  title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a>,
  "<a   href="Consensus_Decision_Making.md" class="wikilink"
  title="consensus decision-making">"consensus decision-making</a>, and
  "<a   href="Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="federalist">"federalist</a>
  structures where communities make decisions directly and coordinate
  through voluntary association rather than delegating power to
  representatives.
