> The Tiv are somewhat similar to the Konkomba, but more structured in
> their social order. Over a million live in central Nigeria on a
> rolling plain extending to the banks of the Benue river. Population
> density is well over a hundred people per square mile. Like the
> Konkomba, Tiv are also subsistence farmers engaged in grain and yam
> cultivation. They have few cattle due to the problem of tsetse flies.
> Their settlements are composed of rather dispersed compounds, each
> consisting of a ring of huts and connected to other compounds by
> paths. The segmentary patrilineal system is the fundamental principle
> of social organisation.
>
> Every Tiv identifies himself with a tar, a term like 'country', which
> refers to a given place associated with a patrilineage. Most men
> reside in their own home tar, but most tars have individuals dwelling
> in them from others. "In time of war, Tiv say, a man must return to
> his tar in order to assist his ityo (patrilineage)" (Bohannan, L, 41).
>
> The ityo is split into further segments. The ultimate unit is the
> compound of a family - usually an extended family. Within it the
> senior male, who is normally also an older man, is responsible for the
> members and their actions. One who is seen as a continual
> trouble-maker may be expelled from the compound by the elder. The
> elder devotes himself to the daily problems of keeping peace and
> settling quarrels. He must possess the necessary knowledge for peace
> keeping and, therefore, should know the jural customs, the genealogy
> and history of his kinsmen, the health and fertility magic, and be in
> "possession of the witchcraft substance, tsav. Legitimate power
> depends on possession of a mystical quality which ensures peace and
> fertility.
>
> Bohannan lists four relationships in which there is "definite
> authority" among the Tiv. Three of these are kinship roles: the
> position of the senior member of the compound mentioned above, the
> father-son relationship and that of husband and wife. A fourth
> relationship involving the role of police and judges in the
> market-place is discussed below.
>
> In addition, there are also men of prestige or influence among the
> Tiv. These are often elders, but they could be others as well. They
> possess wealth and demonstrate generosity and astuteness. They were
> once able to purchase slaves and build up gangs which were used to
> sell safe conduct to strangers and to rob others. Such individuals
> were difficult to control. Witchcraft and magic in the hands of the
> elders were the only effective means of restraining those who were not
> elders. However, men of prestige who were also elders controlled these
> supernatural powers too, thus nullifying such attempts to curb them.
> Therefore travellers seem to have been faced continually with a
> protection racket.
>
> Elders within a lineage could be called together in assembly to deal
> with various problems such as occur in connection with witchcraft,[^1]
> magic and curses. These include deaths, sickness, dreams, barrenness,
> and 'bad luck'. The meeting discusses the matter but has no means to
> enforce settlements. Good 'judges' are those who get the litigants to
> concur in a solution which accords with Tiv custom. An elder can only
> suggest settlement and must work to bring all parties to an agreeable
> resolution. He is a mediator, not a judge. Witchcraft accusation is
> very common among the Tiv and it is seen as a cause for innumerable
> different kinds of events. The elders are invariably reluctant to call
> a moot to discuss accusations against a man of prestige. In such
> cases, then, members of a victim's age set, and afterwards members of
> his own lineage, approach the elders and request an inquest.
>
> For other problems there is no moot or inquest. Rather, the persons
> involved seek out an elder and ask him to mediate. If a thief has been
> caught, the victims may go directly to the thief's compound head and
> demand compensation. In cases of negligence the victim may go directly
> to the culprit.
>
> The lineage group is not the only source of protection for the
> individual. Tiv are divided among age sets. Every young man is
> initiated into a given set and throughout his life he passes or
> graduates along with his set mates through several grades, each of
> which is associated with certain communal responsibilities. The age
> set acts as a peer group mutual aid association, cutting across
> lineage lines and consolidating individuals from different lineages,
> but of similar age. Thus a man asks his age set for protection against
> witches and witchcraft accusations. He may seek assistance for land
> clearing and other farm work or in financial matters. If one's lineage
> for any reason withdraws its supernatural protection, a man has his
> age set as protector. Age sets may assemble to inquire into the health
> of one of their members.
>
> Among the Tiv the age set system is nowhere near as elaborately
> developed as among many other African peoples; in fact with the Tiv it
> is a rather amorphous form of organisation. It appears to be most
> important to the young adult males as a device for mutual aid and
> protection. Young men have reason to be wary of the supernatural power
> and especially the malevolent powers of witchcraft allegedly resting
> in the hands of the older men. Thus their solidarity at this stage
> becomes crucial. About age 40, as men pass into eldership roles, the
> age set function changes to one of protecting the vested interests of
> eldership against the jealous and resentful. After age 50 the set
> members constitute a sentimental association: they are no longer
> competitors.
>
> Between lineage segments there is often feuding and between larger
> segments fighting can become fierce. But the Tiv also have treaty and
> pact-making mechanisms. Lineage segments desirous of being able to
> conduct peaceful trade make treaties with other segments aimed at safe
> conduct, where otherwise as strangers they would be captured or
> killed. These treaties "forbid shedding of blood of contracting .
> parties and any act which might lead to it (such as shaving)"
> (Bohannan, L, 62).
>
> Market pacts secure order in the major local trading centre. This is a
> market associated with the tar which owns the land and controls the
> market-place. The lineage segment controls the market magic important
> to securing peace in the market-place, but it also provides market
> police and judges, all for keeping order. Thus we have within this
> anarchic polity a circumscribed and restricted area of
> governmental-style polity. However it should be emphasised that this
> police power is restricted to the market-place and time and is not
> generalised outside those boundaries. It suggests that Tiv found
> traditional techniques of social control inadequate for handling
> breaches of peace in the market-place and so introduced the police.
> The Konkomba, too, have markets, each of which is under the control of
> the clan on whose land the market is located. They, however, do not
> invoke police. Rather, the market elder has ritual control over a
> market shrine and he may invoke its supernatural power. Konkomba
> believe an unconfessed thief would be stung to death by bees which
> inhabit the trees around the shrine. On confessing his guilt, a thief
> provides the market elder with a guinea fowl which is sacrificed on
> the shrine.
>
> The Tiv represent one of the largest and most densely populated of
> acephalous societies. As with the Konkomba, the segmentary system is
> of fundamental importance to the political order. This suggests that
> most of that order is conceived in kinship terms. Yet the Tiv depend
> upon a number of ancillary systems for maintaining peace. Age sets are
> important devices for protecting the interests of peer groups. There
> are treaties and pacts and a rudimentary governmental structure in
> connection with markets. Underlying the whole system is the power of
> religious sanctions, which is a power diffused especially in the older
> members of the community.
>
> Tiv society is one of intergenerational strains: of elders enforcing
> their authority and younger men resenting it. But when the younger
> graduate to eldership they too are concerned about maintaining and
> extending their positions of dominance. As with any age grading
> system, the individual may find himself in an inferior position, but
> also has the satisfaction of knowing that eventually, with the passage
> of time, he too will ultimately graduate to the top of the pile.

[^1]: Witchcraft differs from sorcery. In the latter an individual
    deliberately carries out specific rituals aimed at injuring another
    party. In witchcraft it is only believed that a person, alleged to
    be a witch, performs malevolent ritual and non-ritual acts. Of
    course, such a person also, in fact, holds a position which is
    feared or resented by the believer in witchcraft.
