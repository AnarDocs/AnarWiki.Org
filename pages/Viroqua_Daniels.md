## Early Life and Radicalization

Daniels was born on December 4, 1859, in
"<a   href="Tipton,_Iowa.md" class="wikilink" title="Tipton, Iowa">"Tipton,
Iowa</a>, to Sylvester Daniels and Mary (Lumley) Daniels.[^1] Her early
life was shaped by the tumultuous events of the era - just six months
after her birth, a massive tornado devastated Cedar County, though her
family's farm was spared. Her father served in the Union Army during the
Civil War as a musician, playing fife, bugle, and fiddle, an experience
that may have influenced her later anti-militarist views.[^2]

At sixteen, Daniels moved with her family to their
"<a   href="Homestead_Acts.md" class="wikilink"
title="homestead">"homestead</a> in
"<a   href="Northern_California.md" class="wikilink"
title="Northern California">"Northern California</a>[^3], settling in the
remote Lake City area of Surprise Valley, nearly 200 miles from the
nearest railroad station. This isolation would later inform her
critiques of centralized power and her vision of decentralized,
autonomous communities.

A life-altering wagon accident at age nineteen, when her skirt caught in
the brake causing her to hit her head on the steering wheel, led to
chronic illness that would affect her for the rest of her life.[^4]
Unable to engage in public speaking or extensive travel, Daniels
channeled her revolutionary spirit into writing, developing a sharp and
distinctive literary voice that would make her a significant figure in
anarchist publishing.

## Revolutionary Thought and Writing

Unlike many of her anarchist contemporaries who saw revolutionary
potential in America's founding documents, Daniels offered a scathing
critique of the
"<a   href="United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.md" class="wikilink"
title="United States Declaration of Independence">"United States
Declaration of Independence</a>, exposing it as a tool of ruling class
manipulation designed to convince workers to die in wars fought for the
wealthy to avoid taxation.[^5]

Daniels developed a comprehensive critique of capitalism, state power,
and social hierarchies. She argued that "Despotism is irrevocably united
with ownership," rejecting the possibility of genuine democracy under
capitalism. Her vision of anarchist-communism called for the abolition
of money, profit, and commerce in favor of equitable exchange and
voluntary cooperation. As she powerfully articulated:

> "The modern commercial mill has ground the last spark of obtainable
> profit out of the living masses and is at this moment run by the
> fictions of presumable profits of the masses yet to come. It has
> worked everything in sight, and nearly all speculative futures. Can we
> keep on forever in the old way?"[^6]

## Anarcha-Feminist Analysis

Daniels extended her revolutionary analysis to questions of gender and
sexuality, offering radical critiques of marriage and family
institutions. She argued that economic dependence subjected wives to
their husbands' will just as workers were subjected to their employers,
asking "What can be worse than sex slavery?"[^7]

Her perspective on women's suffrage was characteristically radical.
While recognizing its value in challenging women's perceived
inferiority, she exposed its limitations:

> "Suffrage, male or female, is merely a bait fastened to the political
> machinery to coax the populace to tolerate the government trap."[^8]

## Revolutionary Press Activities

Daniels was a prolific contributor to the anarchist press network,
writing for numerous publications including
"<a   href="The_Firebrand_(anarchist_publication).md" class="wikilink"
title="The Firebrand">"The Firebrand</a>,
"<a   href="Free_Society.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Society">"Free
Society</a>, Why?, "<a   href="Mother_Earth_(magazine).md" class="wikilink"
title="Mother Earth">"Mother Earth</a>, and
"<a   href="The_Dawn_(anarchist_publication).md" class="wikilink"
title="The Dawn">"The Dawn</a>.[^9] The editors of Firebrand praised her
as "an earnest woman, a vigorous thinker, a clear writer, and the
especial pride of the movement of the west," noting that she could
convey more in a short article than Marx managed in Capital.[^10]

When the publishers of Discontent were arrested under the
"<a   href="Comstock_laws.md" class="wikilink" title="Comstock laws">"Comstock
laws</a> in September 1901, Daniels defended the publication on the
basis of "<a   href="freedom_of_speech.md" class="wikilink"
title="freedom of speech">"freedom of speech</a>.[^11]

## Personal Life and Legacy

Between the mid-1880s and 1910, Daniels formed a close relationship with
"<a   href="Sigismund_Danielewicz.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sigismund Danielewicz">"Sigismund Danielewicz</a>, a Jewish
anarchist and labor organizer notable for his opposition to anti-Chinese
racism in the Western labor movement. This connection integrated her
into a network of revolutionary editors working to spread anarchist
ideas among English-speaking audiences.[^12]

Around 1900, she married Richard Daverkosen, a German-American house
painter, and had one son, Herman Hubert. Despite these personal changes,
she maintained her revolutionary commitments and continued publishing
until World War I.[^13] She died in San Francisco in November 1942,
leaving behind a powerful legacy of radical thought and uncompromising
critique of authority in all its forms.
