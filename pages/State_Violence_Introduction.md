# Problems with Hierarchical Capitalist Justice Systems

The current system of handling violence and anti-social behaviour under
hierarchical capitalism faces numerous fundamental problems that
anarchists argue make it counterproductive and oppressive.

## Creation and Maintenance of Crime

Rather than emerging from social necessity to protect people, modern
police forces developed as a means for the ruling class to maintain
greater control over the population. Police historically arose when
crime was already diminishing, coinciding with the creation of new forms
of crime through the criminalization of predominantly lower-class
behaviours that had previously been acceptable, such as vagrancy,
gambling, and public drunkenness.

Those in authority define "criminal activity" according to their own
needs, then present their definitions as neutral and timeless. For
example, many more people may be killed by pollution and work-related
accidents than by drugs, but drug dealers are branded a threat to
society, not factory owners.

## Disproportionate Impact on Marginalized Communities

The criminal justice system serves as the executive arm of racist and
classist oppression:

- **Racial Disparity**: In the US, one third of African American men are
  either in prison, on probation or on parole. In the UK, black people
  are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched and make up 15%
  of the prison population despite representing just 2.2% of the overall
  population.

- **Class Bias**: Over two-thirds of prisoners in the US are locked up
  for nonviolent offenses. The majority of prisoners are poor people,
  reflecting the criminalization of poverty-related behaviours and the
  greater chance poor people have of being convicted or sentenced more
  harshly.

## Failure to Address Root Causes

The current system focuses on punishment rather than addressing the
underlying social conditions that contribute to harmful behaviour:

- Economic inequality, poverty, homelessness, and alienation drive much
  crime, yet these root causes remain unaddressed
- The punitive approach creates "universities of crime" where first-time
  offenders learn new techniques and adapt to criminal subcultures
- Authoritarian child-rearing practices and social conditioning that
  promote violence and anti-social behaviour are perpetuated

## Removal of Agency from Those Affected

The state assumes responsibility for dealing with offenses, removing all
power and agency from victims, communities, and even defendants. This
process:

- Can be traumatic for both victim and offender
- Often leaves victims unsatisfied
- Creates a marked "criminal class" who struggle to reintegrate into
  society
- Prevents genuine accountability and healing

## Serving Elite Interests

The justice system ultimately serves to preserve existing power
structures:

- It creates fear and division that serves the desires of the powerful
- Criminalizing property damage creates safe environments for investors
- The "War on Drugs" justifies police occupation of poor neighborhoods
  and mass imprisonment
- Thousands of workers killed by employer negligence face no criminal
  consequences, while poor people stealing food face imprisonment

## Prison as Industry

The prison system has become a profitable industry that:

- Funnels billions of public dollars to institutions that strengthen
  state control
- Provides slave labor through prisoners working for cents per hour
- Creates economic incentives for maintaining high prison populations
- Operates company stores where prisoners must buy necessities at
  inflated prices

## Perpetuating Violence

Rather than reducing violence, the system often increases it:

- Police and prisons are themselves systems of extreme violence against
  the most oppressed
- The presence of militarized police in poor neighborhoods correlates
  with high crime rates
- Prison conditions encourage gang violence and create more dangerous
  individuals upon release
- The adversarial system pits people against each other rather than
  seeking resolution

## Suppression of Community Solutions

The state's monopoly on justice prevents communities from developing
their own methods of conflict resolution and healing, creating
dependence on a system that serves elite interests rather than community
needs.

These systemic problems demonstrate why anarchists argue that the
current approach to crime and justice cannot be reformed, but must be
replaced with community-based alternatives that address root causes and
empower those affected by harm.
