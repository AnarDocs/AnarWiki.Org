Philly Stands Up, a non-hierarchical, all-volunteer collective in
Philadelphia[^2], "works with people who have committed sexual assault
to support them through the process of taking responsibility for their
actions, learning from them and changing their behaviors, and restoring
healthy relationships with their community."[^3]

The group operates by consensus and adheres to principles of
"Transformative Justice," meaning that they strive to eliminate "the
social conditions that perpetuate violence - systems of oppression and
exploitation, domination, and state violence". They are prison
abolitionists, and they have a policy of never engaging with the police
or the legal system.[^4]

Asked why sexual assault perpetrators agree to work with Philly Stands
Up, a collective member answered: "It depends, and it's not always easy.
Party, we try and show them that by working with us in a process, it's
hopefully going to improve their life. They're going to be hopefully
invited back into the community. They're going to learn a lot about
themselves. They're going to have stronger and more authentic
relationships. And hopefully we're getting them to a place where they
understand that they don't want to commit harm and they want to be
accountable."[^5]
