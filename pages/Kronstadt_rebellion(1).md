# Kronstadt Rebellion

In 1921, the sailors, soldiers and workers of Russia's Kronstadt naval
fortress proclaimed a libertarian-leaning "third revolution", following
the February 1917 revolution that overthrew the Tsar and the October
1917 revolution that installed the Soviet Union.

## Background

According to
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a>, the Kronstadt sailors had been "the pride and glory of the
Russian Revolution" of 1917.[^1] In May 1917, the Kronstadt soviet
(workers' council) declared itself the only legitimate government of the
fortress, and decisions were made at general assemblies, held almost
daily.[^2]

By the end of 1917, Kronstadt's residents had become disillusioned by
the authoritarianism of the new Communist government. Defying the
Communists' instructions, the people of Kronstadt socialized their
dwellings. Each residential building established a House Committee, and
these committees confederated into a District Committee. The District
Committees confederated into a Borough Committee.[^3]

As the "<a   href="Russian_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> wound down in late 1920,
the
"<a   href="Bolsheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>
presided over a nation in ruin. Their communist
"<a   href="Red_Army.md" class="wikilink" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> had
defeated the anti-communist White Army, but faced mass disillusionment
from unbearable living conditions—famine, disease, cold, and
weariness—induced by years of war and exacerbated by the Bolshevik
policy of
"<a   href="War_Communism.md" class="wikilink" title="War Communism">War
Communism</a>. Peasants had started to resent government requisitions of
grain, with seizures of their already meager harvest being coupled with
cutbacks on bread rations and a fuel shortage.

By January 1921, about 60% of large factories in
"<a   href="Petrograd.md" class="wikilink" title="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> had
closed due to lack of fuel, and food supplies had virtually disappeared.
In February, protests broke out when the government reduced bread
rations by one third for inhabitants of all cities. The workers demanded
the end of War Communism and a return to free labor. Instead of
negotiating, the government created a wartime Committee of Defense with
"<a   href="Zinoviev.md" class="wikilink" title="Zinoviev">Zinoviev</a> as
Chairman to suppress the strike movement.

## The Kronstadt Movement

In February 1921, Kronstadt secretly sent delegates to Petrograd with
the message that "if the workers rise up in a third, genuinely
proletarian revolution for the real slogans of October, then Kronstadt
will support them with all its strength, unanimously and with the will
to conquer or die."[^4]

On 24 February 1921, Petrograd's workers went on strike. Four days
later, as the military violently repressed the strike, sailors from one
of Kronstadt's battleships, *"<a   href="Petropavlovsk.md" class="wikilink"
title="Petropavlovsk">Petropavlovsk</a>*, passed a resolution supporting
the Petrograd workers. The sympathetic movement began among the crews of
the *Petropavlovsk* and
*"<a   href="Sevastopol.md" class="wikilink" title="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>*—the
ships that in 1917 had been the main support of the Bolsheviks.

On 1 March, some 16,000 of Kronstadt's sailors, soldiers and workers met
and unanimously affirmed the *Petropavlovsk* resolution. The meeting was
held on Anchor Square in Kronstadt and was attended by President
"<a   href="Kalinin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kalinin">Kalinin</a> and
Commissar of the Baltic Fleet
"<a   href="Kuzmin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kuzmin">Kuzmin</a>. Despite
their opposition, the resolution was passed overwhelmingly.

## The Fifteen Demands

The resolution demanded new elections for the soviets, freedom of
speech, freedom for peasants, the release of political prisoners, and
other reforms:

1.  New elections to the Soviets by secret ballot with full freedom of
    agitation among workers and peasants
2.  Freedom of speech and press for workers, peasants, Anarchists, and
    left Socialist parties
3.  Freedom of assembly for labor unions and peasant organizations
4.  A non-partisan conference of workers, Red Army soldiers and sailors
    no later than March 10, 1921
5.  Liberation of all Socialist political prisoners and all workers,
    peasants, Red soldiers and sailors imprisoned as a result of
    workers' and peasants' movements
6.  Election of a commission to examine cases of those in prisons and
    concentration camps
7.  Abolition of political offices (*politotdeli*), since no political
    party should have privileges for propagating its ideas or receive
    money from the State
8.  Abolition of barriers and armed units for suppressing traffic and
    confiscating foodstuffs
9.  Equalization of rations for all workers, except those engaged in
    occupations dangerous to health
10. Abolition of Communist shock-troops in all Army units and Communist
    guards in factories
11. Full freedom for peasants regarding their land and right to possess
    cattle, without employing hired labor
12. Establishment of a travelling control commission
13. Permission for free exercise of handicrafts, provided no hired help
    is used
14. Request for all Army units and military cadets to join the
    resolution
15. Demand that all resolutions be widely publicized in the press[^5]

## Formation of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee

On 2 March, three hundred delegates met and established the Provisional
Revolutionary Committee to prepare new elections for Kronstadt's soviet
and to defend the area against inevitable repression from the State. The
spirit of the Conference was thoroughly Sovietist—Kronstadt demanded
Soviets free from interference by any political party.

When Commissar Kuzmin addressed the delegates, his speech proved
inflammatory. He denied the labor disorders in Petrograd, praised the
commissars, questioned Kronstadt's revolutionary motives, and
threatened: "If you want to open warfare, you shall have it, for the
Communists will not give up the reins of government." This tactless
speech served to insult and outrage the delegates.

As it became apparent that the government representatives could not be
trusted, Kuzmin and Chairman
"<a   href="Vassiliev.md" class="wikilink" title="Vassiliev">Vassiliev</a>
were placed under arrest. However, the motion to detain other Communists
present was voted down by an overwhelming majority—the delegates held
that Communists must be considered on equal footing with other
organizations.

## Bolshevik Response

The Communists responded by securing control of strategic points around
Kronstadt, maintaining their repressive siege on Petrograd, making
certain concessions to workers to calm them, organizing a special army
corps to attack Kronstadt, and launching a campaign of slander against
Kronstadt.[^6]

Already on March 2, the government issued a prikaz (order) signed by
"<a   href="Lenin.md" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> and
"<a   href="Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>
denouncing the Kronstadt movement as mutiny against Communist
authorities. The sailors were charged with being "the tools of former
Tsarist generals who together with Socialist-Revolutionary traitors
staged a counter-revolutionary conspiracy against the proletarian
Republic."

The Communist Party leadership claimed Kronstadt's rebellion was led by
the Tsarist ex-general Kozlovsky and other White Guards. Although
Kozlovsky did not play any role in the rebellion, it was true that he
served as a military specialist in Kronstadt—the reason being that
Trotsky himself had installed Kozlovsky there! Moreover, Trotsky
appointed the Tsarist ex-officer "<a   href="Tukhachevsky.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</a> at the command of forces preparing
to repress the Kronstadt revolt. By contrast, Kronstadt's Provisional
Revolutionary Committee did not include any White Guards.[^7]

The Petrograd Committee of Defense assumed full control and put the
whole Northern District under martial law. All meetings were prohibited.
Numerous workers, soldiers and sailors suspected of sympathizing with
Kronstadt were arrested, while families of Kronstadt sailors living in
Petrograd were taken into custody as hostages.

## Life in Revolutionary Kronstadt

Far from having anything to do with generals and counter-revolutionists,
the Kronstadt sailors refused to accept aid even from the
"<a   href="Socialist-Revolutionist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist-Revolutionist Party">Socialist-Revolutionist Party</a>.
When party leader
"<a   href="Viktor_Chernov.md" class="wikilink" title="Viktor Chernov">Viktor
Chernov</a> offered aid and provisions, the Revolutionary Committee
declined his assistance.

The Revolutionary Committee established the principle of "equal rights
for all, privileges to none." Food rations were equalized—the sailors,
who under Bolshevik rule had received rations far exceeding those of
workers, themselves voted to accept no more than the average citizen.
Special rations were given only to hospitals and children's homes.

Many Kronstadt Communists publicly announced their withdrawal from the
Party in protest against its despotism and bureaucratic corruption. The
pages of the Kronstadt newspaper *Izvestia* contained hundreds of names
of Communists who could no longer "remain in the Party of the
executioner Trotsky." Even the Provisional Bureau of the Kronstadt
Section of the Communist Party issued a manifesto calling upon Party
members to take part in elections and not obstruct measures of the
Provisional Revolutionary Committee.

## The Vision of the Third Revolution

Kronstadt proclaimed the necessity of a "Third Revolution" to complete
the liberation begun in 1917. According to the rebels, the Bolsheviks
had betrayed the principles of the October Revolution, making the Soviet
government a bureaucratic autocracy sustained by
"<a   href="Cheka.md" class="wikilink" title="Cheka">Cheka</a> terror.

The citizens of Kronstadt did not want the holding of a new constituent
assembly or return of representative democracy, but the return of power
to free "<a   href="workers&#39;_councils.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a>. They demanded
reform rather than the demise of the Bolshevik party, seeking to
eliminate its authoritarian and bureaucratic tendencies that had grown
during the civil war.

In their newspaper, the Revolutionary Committee declared: "Here, in
Kronstadt, has been laid the cornerstone of the Third Revolution which
is to break the last chains of the worker and open the new, broad road
to Socialist creativity."

## The Attack on Kronstadt

"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> and other Anarchists unsuccessfully tried to get the
Communists to agree to a peace deal with Kronstadt. Goldman explains
that "Kronstadt had never had any thought of 'mutiny' against the Soviet
government. Right up to the last, it was determined to spill no blood.
Continually it called for a compromise and amicable settlement."[^8]

On 5 March, Trotsky sent Kronstadt an ultimatum, warning that Kronstadt
must "submit immediately to the authority of the Soviet Republic...Only
those who surrender unconditionally can expect mercy from the Soviet
Republic."[^9]

A group of Anarchists in Petrograd, including
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> and
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, made a final attempt to induce the Bolsheviks to
reconsider. They sent a protest to the Committee of Defense, suggesting
that a commission of five persons, including two Anarchists, go to
Kronstadt to settle the dispute by peaceful means.

For ten days, from 7 March to 17 March, the Soviet military bombed and
shelled Kronstadt.[^10] On March 7, at 6:45 in the evening, Communist
batteries opened fire against Kronstadt. It was the anniversary of Women
Workers' Day, and under fire, the sailors sent a radio greeting to
working women of the world.

## The Fall of Kronstadt

The Kronstadt garrison consisted of fewer than 14,000 people, who had to
defend a widespread front with many forts and batteries scattered over
the vast area of the Gulf. The repeated attacks of the Bolsheviks, who
were continuously supplied with fresh troops, along with lack of
provisions and long sleepless nights in the cold, gradually sapped
Kronstadt's vitality.

On March 16, the Bolsheviks made a concentrated attack from three sides
at once. The plan was worked out in detail by Commander-in-Chief
"<a   href="Tukhachevsky.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</a>. On the morning of March 17,
several forts had been taken. Through the Petrograd Gates, the
Bolsheviks broke into the city, and brutal slaughter began. The
Communists who had been spared by the sailors now betrayed them,
attacking from the rear.

"<a   href="Dybenko.md" class="wikilink" title="Dybenko">Dybenko</a>,
appointed Commissar of Kronstadt, was vested with absolute powers to
"clean the mutinous city." An orgy of revenge followed, with the
"<a   href="Cheka.md" class="wikilink" title="Cheka">Cheka</a> claiming
numerous victims in nightly wholesale executions. About 8,000 Kronstadt
refugees, mostly soldiers, crossed into Finland to escape summary
executions.

There are no reliable figures on how many rebels were killed during the
repression of Kronstadt, but one 1935-6 statistical review estimates
that 10,026 people were arrested following the revolt.[^11]

## Legacy

The Kronstadt rebellion was the first popular and entirely independent
attempt at liberation from the yoke of State Socialism—an attempt made
directly by the people, by the workers, soldiers and sailors themselves.
It was the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule on Russian territory
during the Russian Civil War.

Kronstadt sounded the death knell of Bolshevism with its Party
dictatorship, centralization, Cheka terrorism and bureaucratic castes.
It shocked intelligent minds in Europe and America into critical
examination of Bolshevik theories and practices. It proved that the
Communist Party dictatorship and the Russian Revolution were opposites,
contradictory and mutually exclusive.

The rebellion demonstrated the possibility of genuine workers' democracy
free from party control, based on the principle of "All power to the
Soviets, not to parties!" Though defeated militarily, Kronstadt's vision
of the Third Revolution continued to inspire anarchist and libertarian
socialist movements worldwide.

While the revolt was suppressed and the rebels' political demands were
not met, it served to accelerate the implementation of the
"<a   href="New_Economic_Policy.md" class="wikilink"
title="New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a>, which replaced War
Communism. However, none of Kronstadt's democratic demands were
fulfilled—the Bolsheviks became even more authoritarian, eliminating
internal and external opposition to the party.
