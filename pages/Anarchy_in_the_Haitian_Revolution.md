Following many years of hidden and small-scale resistance, African
slaves in the French colony of Saint Domingue (or San Domingo) rose up
in 1791 against their colonizers and slave masters. By 1804, they
abolished slavery, expelled the French colonizers, and established the
independent republic of Haiti. Haiti was the name given to the Caribbean
island by the Tainos before colonizers arrived, slaughtered the entire
indigenous population, and imported African slaves.

While the 1776 and 1789 revolutions of the USA and France were grounded
in exclusionary "citizens' rights," the Haitian Revolution stood out for
a commitment to universal human rights. Thanks to the revolution,
Haitians enjoyed freedom from enslavement for some forty-six years from
1802 to 1848. According to Nick Nesbitt, the Haitian Revolution was "the
culmination of a radical strand of Enlightenment political philosophy
that acted upon Spinoza's revolutionary proposition: to avoid insofar as
possible the alienation of constituent power to representative bodies
and to 'always preserve the natural right in its entirety.'"[^1]

As Russell Maroon Shoatz, a former
"<a   href="Black_Panther_Party_and_Anarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther">Black Panther</a>, summarizes, the Haitian
Revolution saw two competing tendencies: a centralized “dragon” and a
decentralized “hydra”:

> There, between 1791 and 1804, we witness one of the most titanic
> struggles ever engaged in between (enslaved) workers and their
> overlords. It is through an examination of the events surrounding that
> struggle that we can clearly measure the strengths and weaknesses of
> our dragon and hydra: centralized and decentralized forces of
> change.”[^2]

# Maroonage and Hidden Resistance

In the years preceding the revolution, slaves resisted their conditions
through subversive ritual, strikes, running away, and occasionally
violent revolts.

Gathered in private, slaves would practice ‘’voodo’’ rituals aimed at
controlling their masters’ souls. As many as two-thirds of the slaves
had been born in Africa on the revolution’s eve, and thus the rituals
borrowed elements from a variety of African traditions.[^3] Slaves sang,
“We swear to destroy the whites and all that they possess; let us die
rather than fail to keep this vow.”[^4]

In public, they found ways to more subtly maintain a culture of
opposition. When they heard the church’s funeral bells, Blacks sang
along with their own lyrics, “One good white is dead. The bad ones are
still here.”[^5] The historian Laurent Dubois speculates that the hidden
meaning may have been, “\[T\]he only good white was a dead one.”[^6]

Slaves commonly walked off the job and ran away, for short and long
periods of time. In 1744, sixty-six slaves walked off the plantation in
protest of a cruel overseer. The overseer retaliated by killing one of
the strikers, a pregnant woman. The slaves then killed the overseer and
were condemned to death, but the governor intervened to save them.
According to Dubois, “Such strikes occurred with some regularity and
often led to the negotiated return of the slaves.”[^7] Probably as a
result of such actions, slaves secured a number of rights, including the
right to have their own garden plots and to spend most of the weekend
tending to their plots and selling the products in town for personal
profit.[^8]

At times, the runaways or ‘’maroons’’ left permanently, and by 1751,
there were about three thousand maroons.[^9] Many lived under the
leadership of the chief Mackandal. Occasionally invoking Allah and
asserting an ability to turn into a fly, Mackandal organized a large
army of maroons to try to poison the white masters’ water. He was
betrayed, captured, and burned alive. Some followers believed he changed
shape and escaped just before his execution in 1758.[^10]

# 1791 revolt

On 21 August 1791, slaves began a series of arsons and massacres around
the region of Le Cap. On 22 August, a band inspired by two enslaved
Vodum (Voodoo) practitioners - a man named Boukman and a woman who might
have been named Cécile Fatiman - destroyed a number of plantations. The
revolt “was led by scores of decentralized bands of African
workers.”[^11] C.L.R. James summarizes:

> Each slave-gang murdered its masters and burnt the plantation to the
> ground \[…\] For nearly three weeks the people of Le Cap could barely
> distinguish day from night, while a rain of burning cane straw, driven
> before the wind like flakes of snow, flew over the city and the
> shipping in the harbour, threatening both with destruction.[^12]

Committing a small fraction of the violence afflicted on them by
masters, some slaves reportedly “violated women” and one allegedly
"carried a white child on a pike as standard.”[^13] Given the legacy of
brutal enslavement, however, the rebels were “surprisingly moderate” in
James’s judgment, and they “spared many of the men, women, and
children.”[^14]

Among the many decentralized groups were: maroon rebels such as Jean
Francois and Bissou and Lamour Derance, enslaved rebels including
Romaine the Prophetess and Hyacinthe, mulattos, and "a small segment of
whites who were in league with the anti-slavery wing of the French
Jacobins, and who loosely allied themselves with one rebel group or
another."[^15]

Not long after the start of the revolt, the ex-slave Toussaint Bréda
(later Toussaint L’Ouverture) decided to join in. At the age of 45, he
was already known as “Old Toussaint.”[^16] Toussaint would become the
major figure of the revolution due to his tactical brilliance. Toussaint
came from the relatively privileged domestic sector of slaves.[^17]

As the French Revolution went on, the Haitian revolution energized
masses in Paris: “The slaves \[...\] had shown revolutionary France that
they could fight and die for freedom.”[^18] By August 1792, Parisian
masses opposed slavery. On 11 August, a colonial agent in France
lamented, “One spirit alone reigns here, it is the horror of slavery and
enthusiasm for liberty.”[^19]

In January 1793, French rebels executed the king, and Spain and England
declared war on France. Spanish invaders of Saint Domingue received mass
support from Blacks who wanted to expel French slave masters, and
Toussaint became a Spanish military officer.[^20] Replacing his given
slave name with Toussaint L’Ouverture, he remained loyal to the Spanish
even after French Commissioner Sonthonax declared his support for the
abolition of slavery and promised freedom to those who joined the French
side.[^21]

Ashley Smith explains L’Ouverture’s motivation for hesitating to join
the French side:

> Toussaint was not fooled by the Spanish, and his decision was
> certainly not the result of some African allegiance to kingship. It
> was a rational calculation. He knew that Sonthanax had no power to
> abolish slavery; that lay in the hands of the assembly, which had yet
> to prove itself an ally of the slaves.[^22]

In 1794, France’s National Convention officially abolished slavery in
the French colonies. When he heard this news, L’Ouverture declared his
allegiance with France.[^23] As L’Ouverture accumulated substantial
authority over the country, of the colony’s inhabitants grew impatient
of his judgment.

# L’Ouverture, Dessalines, and Revolts

L’Ouverture appointed prominent whites to top government posts, and he
enacted harsh regulations and forced labor.[^24] Even after Britain
withdrew in 1798 and after the French dictator Napoleon seized power,
L’Ouverture remained loyal to France. Shoatz argues, “Thus at one swell
swoop, these leaders had been forced to play the role of neo-colonial
compradors.”[^25] As many Blacks worried about the possible
reinstitution of chattel slavery, L’Ouverture himself acquired multiple
plantations.[^26] Former white masters now became employers, and the
Black workers were legally forbidden from changing plantations or
occupations.[^27]

In 1795, plantation workers rose up against L’Ouverture, setting
harvests on fire and killing several managers. They even shot
L’Ouverture in the leg, before being suppressed.[^28] In February 1796,
more plantation workers revolted.[^29]

A skilled fighter appointed by L’Ouverture to command the North
Province, General Moïse became the adopted nephew of L’Ouverture. Still,
Moïse had strong misgivings about the ongoing exploitation of Blacks. He
remarked, “Whatever my old uncle may do, I cannot bring myself to be the
executioner of my colour.”[^30] On 22 and 23 September 1801, Blacks in
many areas rose up with the cry, “Long live Moïse” and killed several
hundred whites. Toussaint responded by executing Moïse on 21
November.[^31]

Toussaint's chief lieutenant Jean Jacques Dessalines approached French
General Charles Leclerc and suggested that he be put in charge.[^32]
Sure enough, Leclerc arrested Toussaint, who was taken to France where
he died in prison. Dessalines took leadership of the Haitian army.

As Haitians fought to expel the French, military strength came from
below, from the local districts. James writes: "Derance, Samedi Smith,
Jean Panier, and other nameless petty chieftains, North, South and West,
each in his own district summoned the blacks to revolt \[...\] The
masses were fighting and dying as only revolutionary masses can \[...\]
the women were now fighting side by side with the men."[^33]

Staying loyal to the French, Dessalines and other generals hunted down
and arrested many of these these rebels. Desslaines even invited the
rebels Charles and Sanite Belair for a meeting, ostensibly about the
possibility of joining forces against the French, and at the meeting
Dessalines had them arrested and delivered to Leclerc.[^34]

In October of 1802, Dessalines finally defected from the French.[^35]
Haitians expelled France in 1804, and Dessalines declared himself
emperor for life.

In early 1805, Dessalines ordered a massacre of remaining whites in
Haiti. James criticizes this move:

> "The massacre of the whites was a tragedy; not for the whites. For
> these old slave-owners, those who burnt a little powder in the arse of
> a Negro, who buried him alive for insects to eat, who were well
> treated by Toussaint, and who, as soon as they got the chance, began
> their old cruelties again; for these there is no need to waste one
> tear or one drop of ink. The tragedy was for the blacks and the
> Mulattoes. It was not policy but revenge, and revenge has no place in
> politics. The whites were no longer to be feared, and such purposeless
> massacres degrade and brutalise a population, especially one which was
> just beginning as a nation and had so bitter a past. The people did
> not want it--all they wanted was freedom and independence seemed to
> promise that. Christophe and other generals strongly disapproved.89
> Had the British and the Americans thrown their weight on the side of
> humanity, Dessalines might have been curbed, As it was Haiti suffered
> terribly from the resulting isolation. Whites were banished from Haiti
> for generations, and the unfortunate country, ruined economically, its
> population lacking in social culture, had its inevitable difficulties
> doubled by this massacre."[^36]

As emperor, Dessalines proved to be "a cruel tyrant over the Haitian
people." He was assassinated within a few years.[^37]

Reflecting on the revolution, Shoatz contrasts the ambivalent role of
the centralized “dragon” forces with the consistently revolutionary role
of the decentralized “hydra" forces:

> "Thus, we can see how Haiti’s dragon forces played a very ambivalent
> role in the rebel fight for independence: They started out as
> tenacious and brilliant fighters \[…\] During the course of the
> revolutionary struggle, they all opportunistically switched to the
> French imperialist’s side, and went on to attempt to drown the still
> revolutionary masses and their decentralized group in blood; hoping
> that way the French would allow them to serve as a new elite class of
> African policemen against a re-enslaved African worker’s class.
>
> Failing to suppress the rebels, the dragon forces rejoined the hydra
> elements and lent their \[weight\] to totally defeating the French,
> only to once again turn against the revolutionary masses by
> establishing themselves as a dictatorial and exploitative African
> elite.
>
> For its part, the decentralized hydra forces never veered from their
> objectives of winning as much freedom from servitude and oppression as
> possible. From the pre-revolutionary times of Mackandal, up through
> the 1791-1804 Haitian revolutionary war, and even down to our time,
> they’ve known that in addition to fighting the French during their
> revolution, they were also under attack by Toussaint’s dragon forces,
> who displayed hatred and fear of everything from their refusal to
> relinquish their maroon/decentralized organizational formations, to
> their practice of their traditional Vodum spiritual systems, the
> latter which did a great deal to inspire their soldiers to martyr
> themselves to the cause of freedom.
>
> Then, after being pushed to the side after the French were driven out,
> the decentralized hydra elements were forced to—again—go underground
> and eventually morph into semi-secret Vodum societies that until today
> remain a little recognized or understood autonomous element amongst
> the oppressed Haitians."[^38]
