# Prisons, Police and Criminal Justice Systems

Marxist-Leninists view police, prisons, and criminal justice systems as
instruments of class rule that serve the bourgeoisie under capitalism
but can be seized and repurposed to serve the proletariat during the
transitional socialist period. They argue these coercive institutions
remain necessary to suppress counter-revolutionary elements, maintain
order during economic transformation, and defend revolutionary gains
until class distinctions are fully abolished and the state withers away.
In contrast, anarchists and non-hierarchical socialists reject the
legitimacy of these institutions entirely, arguing they are inherently
oppressive regardless of who controls them and cannot be reformed or
redirected toward liberation.

Rather than maintaining police and prisons under new management,
libertarian socialists (such as anarchists) advocate their complete
abolition and replacement with community-based approaches:
transformative justice processes, restorative practices, community
accountability teams, collective self-defense, and addressing root
causes of harm through mutual aid and eliminating the social conditions
(poverty, hierarchy, alienation) that generate most harmful behavior.
Where Marxist-Leninists see a transitional need for state violence to
protect the revolution, anarchists argue this perpetuates the same
authoritarian logic and creates new ruling classes, pointing to how
every "workers' state" has maintained or expanded carceral systems
rather than dismantling them, with the promise of their eventual
dissolution repeatedly deferred to an always-distant future.
