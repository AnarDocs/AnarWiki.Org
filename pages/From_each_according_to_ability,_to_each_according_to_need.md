# From Each According to His Ability, to Each According to His Needs

## Overview

"**From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs**"
is a principle of production and distribution that has existed in
various forms for nearly two millennia before being popularized by
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> in
1875. The principle advocates for a society where individuals contribute
what they can and receive what they need, without the mediation of
exchange, money, or conditional reciprocity. While commonly attributed
to Marx, the concept has deep roots in early Christian communalism,
medieval monasticism, utopian thought, and pre-Marxist socialist
movements. Anarchist communists have embraced and developed this
principle as central to their vision of a free, stateless society based
on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and voluntary cooperation.

## Origins

### Biblical and Early Christian Foundations

The earliest recorded expressions of the principle appear in the
"<a   href="New_Testament.md" class="wikilink" title="New Testament">New
Testament</a>, particularly in the
"<a   href="Acts_of_the_Apostles.md" class="wikilink"
title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, which describes
the communal practices of early Christian communities in Jerusalem. Acts
4:32-35 states that believers "had all things common" and that
"distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."[^1]
This passage explicitly articulates the "according to need" portion of
the principle.

Acts 11:27-30 provides the complementary concept when describing
financial aid: "Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
determined to send relief unto the brethren."[^2] Together, these
passages establish both halves of what would later become the socialist
principle.

The Apostle "<a   href="Paul.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul">Paul</a>
reinforced this concept in his letters, writing in 2 Corinthians 8:12:
"For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to
what one has, not according to what one does not have."[^3] Similarly, 1
Peter 4:10 instructs: "Each of you should use whatever gift you have
received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its
various forms."[^4]

### Medieval Monasticism

Medieval Christian monasticism institutionalized these principles within
religious communities. The
"<a   href="Rule_of_St._Benedict.md" class="wikilink"
title="Rule of St. Benedict">Rule of St. Benedict</a> (6th century)
established that monks should receive according to their needs,
explicitly quoting Acts 4:35: "Distribution was made to each one
according to his need."[^5] Benedict wrote: "Let the strong not shirk,
let the weak not be discouraged... let each one serve according to the
gift which he has received."[^6]

The
"<a   href="Hutterites.md" class="wikilink" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>,
an Anabaptist community founded in 1528, practiced complete communal
living based on these Biblical passages, with all property held in
common and distribution according to need.[^7]

### Utopian and Revolutionary Formulations

"<a   href="Thomas_More.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas More">Thomas
More</a>'s *"<a   href="Utopia.md" class="wikilink" title="Utopia">Utopia</a>*
(1516) described a fictional society based on communal property where
"no man has any property, all things being held in common" and everyone
received what they needed.[^8]

The English radical "<a   href="Gerrard_Winstanley.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gerrard Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and the
"<a   href="Diggers.md" class="wikilink" title="Diggers">Diggers</a>
(1649-1650) advocated that the earth should be "a common treasury for
all," with people working the common land "according to their strength"
and taking "according to their need."[^9] Winstanley explicitly
articulated both components of the principle in his calls for agrarian
communism.

### Morelly's Formulation

The French utopian philosopher
"<a   href="Étienne-Gabriel_Morelly.md" class="wikilink"
title="Étienne-Gabriel Morelly">Étienne-Gabriel Morelly</a> provided one
of the most explicit pre-Marxist formulations in his 1755 *Code de la
Nature* (Code of Nature). Morelly proposed "Sacred and Fundamental Laws"
including the principle that "Every citizen will make his particular
contribution to the activities of the community according to his
capacity, his talent and his age."[^10] His work directly influenced
later socialist thought and provided a template that would be refined by
subsequent thinkers.

### Pre-Marxist Socialists

The principle became widespread among early nineteenth-century
socialists. The French "<a   href="Saint-Simonians.md" class="wikilink"
title="Saint-Simonians">Saint-Simonians</a> of the 1820s and 1830s used
slogans such as "from each according to his ability, to each ability
according to its work" and "from each according to his capacity, to each
according to his works."[^11]

"<a   href="Louis_Blanc.md" class="wikilink" title="Louis Blanc">Louis
Blanc</a>, a French socialist, articulated the principle clearly in his
1851 work: "Let each produce according to his aptitudes and his force;
let each consume according to his need."[^12] This formulation predates
Marx's famous usage by nearly a quarter century.

## Marx's Appropriation

"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
popularized the slogan in his 1875
*"<a   href="Critique_of_the_Gotha_Programme.md" class="wikilink"
title="Critique of the Gotha Programme">Critique of the Gotha
Programme</a>*, where he presented it as the principle that would govern
"a higher phase of communist society."[^13] Marx described this higher
phase as one where "labor has become not only a means of life but life's
prime want" and where "the narrow horizon of bourgeois right" could
finally be transcended.[^14]

Although Marx is commonly credited as the originator of this phrase, the
slogan was already common within the socialist movement. Marx drew
heavily on earlier formulations, particularly those of Morelly and the
French socialists, while claiming to provide the first "scientific"
analysis of how such a principle could be realized through historical
development.

## The Marxist Undermining: "To Each According to His Contribution"

A fundamental problem emerged in Marxist implementation through the
introduction of an intermediate principle: "**to each according to his
contribution**" or "to each according to his work." Marx himself
introduced this modification, arguing that in what he called the "first
phase of communist society" (later termed "socialism" by
"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>),
goods would be distributed not according to need but according to labor
contributed.[^15]

### The Authoritarian Deviation

Marx explicitly stated that in this lower phase, "the individual
producer receives back from society—after the deductions have been
made—exactly what he gives to it."[^16] This principle of
"<a   href="exchange_of_equivalents.md" class="wikilink"
title="exchange of equivalents">exchange of equivalents</a>—receiving
benefits proportionate to contribution—fundamentally contradicts the
unconditional provision embodied in the original principle.

The "<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">Soviet
Union</a>, claiming to be at this "lower stage," enshrined this
principle in Article 12 of the 1936 Constitution: "From each according
to his ability, to each according to his work."[^17]
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a> described this formulation as an "inwardly contradictory,
not to say nonsensical, formula."[^18]

### Problems with the Contribution Principle

The "contribution" principle reintroduces several features of
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
that the original formulation sought to overcome:

**Conditional Exchange**: By making the provision of goods conditional
on labor contribution, this principle maintains the capitalist logic of
quid pro quo exchange. Individuals must labor not for its own sake or
for the benefit of the community, but as a means to secure their own
survival.[^19]

**Alienated Labor**: Marx himself recognized in his
*"<a   href="Economic_and_Philosophic_Manuscripts_of_1844.md" class="wikilink"
title="Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844">Economic and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</a>* that capitalist labor is alienating
because it is "not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour" done
merely as "a means to satisfy needs external to it."[^20] The
contribution principle perpetuates this alienation by keeping labor
instrumental—a means to survival rather than life's "prime want."[^21]

**Inequality Based on Ability**: Marx acknowledged that the contribution
principle "recognizes unequal individual endowment and thus productive
capacity as natural privileges" and enshrines "a right of
inequality."[^22] Those naturally able to contribute more receive more,
disadvantaging the disabled, elderly, sick, and others with limited
capacity.

**Accounting and Bureaucracy**: Implementing distribution according to
contribution requires extensive measurement, accounting, and enforcement
mechanisms. This creates bureaucratic hierarchies to determine the
"value" of different types of labor—precisely the kind of authoritarian
structure anarchists oppose.[^23]

## The Anarchist Restoration

### Voluntary Contribution: Beyond "Ability"

While anarchist communists embrace the "to each according to need"
portion unconditionally, many have also reconsidered the "from each
according to ability" formulation. This phrase, though far superior to
contribution-based distribution, can still imply that people should or
must contribute at their maximum capacity, or that their value derives
from productive ability.

Kropotkin emphasized that contribution under anarchist communism would
be voluntary and joyful, not obligatory or measured. He wrote that under
communism, people would contribute not because they were required to
work to capacity, but because meaningful labor would become "a pleasure
instead of a curse."[^24] The goal is not extracting maximum
productivity from each person, but creating conditions where people
freely choose to contribute what they wish.

This perspective rejects:

**Productivity as Value**: No one's worth or standing in the community
depends on what they are able to contribute. The elderly, disabled, ill,
or those choosing not to engage in recognized "productive" labor are no
less deserving of having their needs met.

**Obligation to Maximum Capacity**: People should not be expected to
work at their maximum ability. Someone capable of working 60 hours
weekly but preferring 20 has every right to that choice without moral
censure or material penalty.

**Ability Assessment**: Determining what someone is truly "able" to do
requires surveillance and judgment that anarchists reject. Who decides
capacity? This opens the door to coercion and hierarchy.

Likewise, Anarchist communists have consistently rejected the Marxist
"contribution" stage and embraced the full principle of ability to needs
as immediately applicable.

### Kropotkin's Defense

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, in *"<a   href="The_Conquest_of_Bread.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Conquest of Bread">The Conquest of Bread</a>*, extensively
defended distribution according to need against what he called the
socialist principle "to each according to his deeds."[^25] Kropotkin
argued that attempts to measure and reward labor equivalently make
society unworkable: humans "would soon become extinct... if men did not
give continually, without demanding an equivalent reward."[^26]

He further objected to the degrading ethos of conditional exchange:
"Cannot each one of us recall someone who has rendered him so great a
service that we should be indignant if its equivalent in coin were
mentioned?"[^27] Kropotkin called for demolishing "the last vestiges of
middle-class rule, its morality drawn from account-books, its 'debit and
credit' philosophy, its 'mine and yours' institutions."[^28]

### Berkman's Clarification

"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> emphasized that under
the anarchist principle, "there will be no buying or selling" but
instead "free exchange without the medium of money and without profit,
on the basis of requirement and the supply on hand."[^29] He rejected
the notion that products must be exchanged for equivalents, arguing that
the value of goods "is uncertain or not ascertainable."[^30]

### Bookchin's Critique

"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> extended this critique,
condemning "the quid pro quo of reciprocity, exchange, and mutual
aid—all of which are trapped within history's demeaning account books
with their 'just' ratios and their 'honest' balance sheets."[^31] He
argued that conditional exchange means "human relations are always
tainted by the rationality of arithmetic. The human spirit can never
transcend a quantitative world of 'fair dealings' between canny
egos."[^32]

### Freedom and Unconditionality

Anarchist theorists argue that conditional exchange inherently
diminishes freedom by removing options from people's choice sets. When
person P offers goods to person Q only on condition that Q performs
labor for P, P removes Q's preferred option—receiving the goods without
the labor requirement.[^33] This restriction of options constitutes a
limitation on Q's freedom.

By contrast, unconditional provision—giving according to ability,
receiving according to need—maximizes freedom by ensuring no one's
access to necessities depends on satisfying others' preferences. This
aligns with the core anarchist commitment to human freedom and voluntary
association.

### Alternative Formula

Some anarchists have proposed reformulations such as "**from each
according to desire, to each according to need**" or "**from all
voluntarily, to each according to need**," emphasizing that contribution
should flow from autonomous choice rather than capacity-based
expectation.[^34]

## Contemporary Relevance

The principle remains central to anarchist communist organizing, from
the
"<a   href="Zapatistas.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatistas">Zapatistas</a>
in "<a   href="Chiapas.md" class="wikilink" title="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> to
contemporary
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
networks. These movements demonstrate that communities can organize
production and distribution according to need without state enforcement
or market exchange, relying instead on voluntary cooperation and
solidarity.

The "<a   href="COVID-19_pandemic.md" class="wikilink"
title="COVID-19 pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> saw a resurgence of
mutual aid organizing based on these principles, with communities
providing food, medicine, and support according to need rather than
ability to pay. These networks proved more responsive and less
bureaucratic than state welfare systems.[^35]
