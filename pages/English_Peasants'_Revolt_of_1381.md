Notable for its millenarian influences and orientations, the English
peasants' revolt of 1381 opposed tax raises that were seen as an attempt
to reduce yeomen to serfs. Some 100,000 peasants marched from Essex and
Kent to London, capturing towns along the way. Upon reaching London, the
peasants of Kent freed the prisoners, killed the Archduke, and declared
that all rich people and non-begging clergy must be killed.[^1] The
peasants were joined by artisans and desistute townspeople. They opposed
the Statute of Labourers which established maximum wages.[^2]

A crowd of 20,000 peasants in London demanded a meeting with 14 year-old
King Richard II, whom as Murray Bookchin emphasizes, "they naively
viewed as their protector against the feudal lords." Meeting them on
horseback, Richard "flippantly granted all their demands." Satisfied,
the peasants departed and some even stayed to express their allegiance
to him.[^3] Richard II promised major reforms including cheap land and
the abolition of serfdom. He did not actually keep these promises. [^4]

Ultimately, Richard II's forces crushed the rebellions, and the
peasants' economic demands were not met.[^5] Bookchin explains that this
was a scenario "that was to be repeated again and again as nobles were
able to defeat trusting peasant rebels through fraud and finally through
callous murder."

Norman Cohn, and later, Bookchin, have argued that the revolt marked
perhaps the first time when a movement of medieval Europeans saw
egalitarianism as a future ideal rather than just a relic of some
distant golden age.[^6]

The rebels were influenced by the preacher John Ball, who insisted that
all human beings must be equal since they all descended from Adam and
Eve. Reportedly, Ball sermonized: "And if we are all descended from one
father and one mother, Adam and Eve, how can the lords say or prove that
they are more lords than we are - save that they make us dig and till
the ground so that they can squander what we produce?" Cohn comments
that even if the exact words of Ball's speeches have been changed,
"there is every reason to believe that the teaching which they enshrine
was indeed being disseminated at the time of the revolt."[^7]
