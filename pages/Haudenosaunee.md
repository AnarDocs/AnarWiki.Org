## Overview

The Haudenosaunee ("People of the Longhouse", called the "Iroquois" by
Europeans) are a traditionally horticultural and egalitarian
confederation of six (originally five) indigenous nations in
northeastern North America.

According to oral history, five nations (Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,
Cayugas, and Senecas) lived in a state of perpetual war against each
other, until an Onondaga chief named Hiawatha and a peacemaker named
Dengawidah went from village to village and convinced the nations to
unite under a Great Law of Peace. Importantly, they had the support of a
woman named Jigonsaseh, kown as the "Peace Queen" and "Great Woman."[^1]
Later on, a sixth nation, the Tuscarora, joined the Haudenosaunee.

Scholars estimate that the confederation formed either in 1142 or in the
late fifteenth century. Scholars who support the earlier date note that
Seneca oral history recalls that Senacas joined the Great Law of Peace
after a solar eclipse, and the 1142 total eclipse is the only one that
fits their description.[^2] The ethnohistorian Daniel Richter argues
that the League formed in the late fifteenth century, since villages
before that time were "heavily fortified against military attack, and
their cemeteries contained the corpses of both friends and enemies
clearly slain in combat."[^3]

European settlers consistently recognized the extreme freedom existing
within the Haudenosaunee polity. Colonial administrator Cadawaller
Colden reported in 1749 that the Haudenosaunee had "such absolute
Notions of Liberty that they allow of no Kind of Superiority of one over
another, and banish all Servitude from their Territories."[^4]
Historians today have tended to share this view, and Richter describes
the Haudenosaunee traditional society as a "nonstate society" and a
"democratic near-anarchy."[^5] The journalist Charles Mann writes that
when he asked seven scholars (anthropologists, archeologists, and
historians) whether in 1491 they would have preferred to live with the
Haudenosaunee or the Europeans, all seven answered that they would have
rather lived with the Haudenosaunee.[^6]

## Culture

In the seventeenth century, the Haudenosaunee lived in large towns, of
up to 2,000 people.[^7] It was believed that illness resulted from
having unfulfilled desires. As a result, Haudenosaunee allowed children
almost complete freedom and never punished them. They taught children to
be independent and not submissive to authority.[^8]

Women held an equal status to men's, although there was a gendered
division of labor. Ethnohistorian Judith Brown notes, "The powerful
position of Iroquois women was the result of their control of the
economic organization of their tribe." One mechanism for women's
autonomy and high status was that women controlled the distribution of
food within the local community. [^9] “In terms of everyday affairs,”
the anthropologist David Graeber assesses, “Iroquois society often seems
to have been as close as there is to a documented case of a
matriarchy.”[^10] Society was matrilineal, so a man would move in with
his wife once he married. Extended families lived together in buildings
called longhouses, and a woman could easily initiate a divorce by
putting her husband's belongings outside.[^11]

According to Bruce Johansen, "The Iroquois’ law and custom upheld
freedom of expression in political and religious matters, and it forbade
the unauthorized entry of homes."[^12] The Great Law of Peace, indeed,
ensured freedom of expression, as evident in its permission of "lords"
(delegates) to dissent from the Confederate Council's decisions as long
as they did not actually disobey the agreed-upon rules. "If a lord is
guilty of unwarrantably opposing the object of decisions of the council
*and in that his own erroneous will in these matters be carried out*, he
shall be approached and admonished by the chief matron of his family and
clan to desist from evil practices..."[^13]

## Decisions

From the longhouse level to the confederal level, Haudenosaunee
decisions were generally made and enforced without any coercion. Those
elected (by the women) to be headmen were expected to use persuasion and
gift-giving, rather than violence, to win people over. As one
seventeenth-century Mohawk explained, "\[W\]e have no forcing rules or
laws amongst us." Richter summarizes that the Haudenosaunee had a
"nonstate society" with "democratic near-anarchy" with a culture based
on "a shared belief in the ideal of consensus."[^14]

Since women were associated with the earth and men with the sky, it was
women who generally were entrusted to feel "the rumblings of *ne
gashedenza* (the sacred will of the people), which traditionally
originates at the roots of the grass."[^15]

At the most local level, in the longhouse, a council comprised entirely
of women made decisions. Longhouses joined together into villages, and
villages into nations. Councils at the village and the national levels
were made of both men and women. At the league level, only men made
decisions, but a women's council could veto decisions that they didn't
like. So, women had more power in local affairs and men had more power
at the league level. Council members were elected from a pool of
possible heirs. They held no coercive power and received no significant
material rewards.[^16]

Councils made decisions by consensus.[^17] When a village did not reach
consensus, the council tried to facilitate discussions to reach some
compromise. In extreme cases where consensus was not possible, the
village would split into two villages. Members of the councils were
expected to be extremely patient and slow to anger.[^18]

## Economy

The Haudenosaunee traditionally had an economy based on gift-giving and
use-rights. Abandoned land was free for anyone to take, but people could
only own as much as they could personally use. In times of shortage,
everything was communally owned. Labor was collective and divided by
gender. Men hunted, fished, traded, cleared forests, fought wars, and
served as diplomats. Women gardened and raised the children.
Teiowí:sonte Thomas Deer describes traditional Haudenosaunee economies
as communist. Haudenosaunee frequently gave each other wampum beads
(made from whelks and quahog clams) in rituals and diplomatic acts, but
they did not use wampum as currency.[^19]

While Richter describes Haudenosaunee traditional economies as including
"private property," this so-called property more closely resembled
personal possession in Proudhon's terms. Richter explains that ownership
"rested on need and use \[...\] Food, clothing, tools, houses, land, and
other forms of property belonged to those individuals and kin groups who
needed and made active use of them. Conversely, excess or abandoned
property was largely free for the taking, and in times of shortage all
shared in the meager fare.[^20]

In 1758, the Senecas captured fifteen year-old settler Mary Jemison and
adopted her into their society. Later when Jemison was given a choice to
leave, she chose to stay among the Seneca. Jemison wrote about Seneca
women's farming, weaving, and food preparation: “Our labor was not
severe...In the summer season, we planted, tended and harvested our
corn, and generally had all our children with us; but had no master to
oversee or drive us, so that we could work as leisurely as we
pleased.”[^21] According to Judith Brown, "Parker (1910) tends to agree
with Mary Jemison that the work of women was not hard."[^22] Likewise,
the Haudenosaunee 1977 declaration at Geneva recounts: "Prior to the
arrival of the colonists, we were a people who lived by hunting and
gathering, and practiced a form of agriculture which was not labor
intensive."[^23]

# Environment

The Haudenosaunee constitution provided an ecologically-oriented,
long-term perspective, mandating that the confederacy look after "not
only the present but also the coming generations, even those whose faces
are yet beneath the surface of the ground -- the unborn of the future
Nation." Council meetings began with an offering of thanks to: "to the
earth where men dwell, to the streams of water, the pools, the springs
and the lakes, to the maize and the fruits, to the medicinal herbs and
trees, to the forest trees for their usefulness, to the animals that
serve as food and give their pelts for clothing, to the great winds and
the lesser winds, to the Thunderers, to the Sun, the mighty warrior, to
the moon, to the messengers of the Creator who reveal his wishes and to
the Great Creator who dwells in the heavens above, who gives all the
things useful to men, and who is the source and the ruler of health and
life."[^24]

Everything or nearly everything was "alive with spiritual power" and
humans had reciprocal obligations with nonhuman entities including
animals, trees, and the wind. If humans fulfilled their obligations, the
animals would offer flesh for meat and the trees would offer themselves
for wood. If humans did not provide the proper ceremonies thanking their
nonhuman surroundings, then "the results could be hunger, sickness,
injury, or death."[^25]

Women, as the Daughters of Mother Earth, were entrusted to "make the
best decisions regarding the children and land of Mother Earth."[^26]

The Mohawks' “Thanksgiving Address” teaches gratitude for the earth, and
the Mohawks have for decades been involved in struggles to protect the
environment, including a major struggle against General Motors over
contamination of Mohawk land with PCBs.[^27]

## Crime

Anthony Wallace describes how the Haudenosaunee used diffused sanctions
to respond to crime:

> Behavior was governed not by published laws, enforced by police,
> courts, and jails, but by oral tradition, supported by a sense of
> duty, a fear of gossip, and a dread of retaliatory witchcraft. Theft,
> vandalism, armed robbery, were almost unknown.”[^28]

Similarly, Gary Nash explains that without any laws, jails, or police,
the Haudenosaunee “maintained a strict sense of right and wrong...He who
stole another's food or acted invalourously in war was 'shamed' by his
people and ostracized from their company until he had atoned for his
actions and demonstrated to their satisfaction that he had morally
purified himself.”[^29]

## Revolution

Haudenosaunee historian Barbara Alice Mann remarks of the League's
lengthy success at holding off European colonization:

> "The intense resistance by the Iroquois spared their Lakes, Plains,
> Southwestern, and Northwestern cousins three hundred years worth of
> additional suffering."[^30]

The Haudenosaunee denounced slavery and regularly provided shelter to
people who escaped from slavery. Many maroons were adopted into
Haudenosaunee society where they enjoyed full rights and happily
intermarried.[^31]

## Oka Crisis

In 1990, Mohawks in Oka (near "Montreal") held a 77-day blockade which
successfully stopped the construction of a proposed golf course. This
standoff is known as the
<a href="Oka_Crisis.md" class="wikilink" title="Oka Crisis">Oka Crisis</a>.

## 1492 Land Back Lane

In July 2020, a Haudenosaunee group launched an encampment blocking
construction that would have turned Ontario farmland into a suburban
housing development. Called 1492 Land Back Lane, the encampment was led
by "a collective of unnamed women, in keeping with the Haudenosaunee’s
matriarchal society."[^32] As of March 2022, 1492 Land Back Lane was
still going.[^33]

## Neighboring Societies

In precolonial times, the Haudenosaunee signed a treaty with the
<a href="Nishnaabeg.md" class="wikilink" title="Nishnaabeg">Nishnaabeg</a>
called Gdoo-naaganinaa, meaning "Our dish." The treaty recognized the
fact that the two parties ate from a shared "dish" since they shared
hunting areas and overlapping plant and animal species depended on the
health of both parties' lands. The treaty said that neither party could
abuse the landbase, and Nishnaabeg and Haudenosaunee delegates were
required to regularly gather for meetings and rituals.[^34]

In the seventeenth century, the Haudenosaunee waged war against the
<a href="Wendat.md" class="wikilink" title="Wendat">Wendat</a> (Huron) that
Murray Bookchin described as a “genocidal”. Stephen Arthur responds that
the “conflict is better understood as a civil war of political
unification among Iroquois speakers...the result was far from genocide
of their opponents—rather, it was the political unification of most
northern Iroquois peoples” under the Haudenosaunee confederation.[^35]

## "Warp and Weft," from *The Years of Rice and Salt* by Kim Stanley Robinson

*This section was submitted by Javier Sethness.* In *The Years of Rice
and Salt* (2001), an alternate-speculative history written by
anti-authoritarian scifi author Kim Stanley Robinson (KSR), book five,
entitled "Warp and Weft," imagines an encounter between a Japanese rebel
and the Haudenosaunee in the geographical location now known as New
York. Before passing to an examination of this intriguing chapter, a
note about *The Years of Rice and Salt*: this text imagines a world
wherein over 99% of Europeans perished from the Black Plague, such that
the destruction and contributions provided by Europeans over the past 5
centuries are enacted (to lesser or greater degrees) by other peoples,
such as the Chinese and different peoples identifying with Islam (dar
al-Islam, the geographical "House of Islam"). For example, in *Years*,
the continents known in our world as the Americas are "discovered" by
accident by an errant Chinese naval expedition that gets stuck in the
doldrums, while various scientific advances made in European history by
people like Newton and Einstein are made by two intellectuals, Iwang and
Khalid, from Central Asia (Samarqand, Tashkent, Bokhara). In this
alternate timeline, the inter-cultural clash between indigenous peoples
and the Chinese is not as totally genocidal as it was with the Europeans
in actual fact, though the Chinese did enslave the peoples of the Incan
Empire to extract wealth from them, and smallpox and other diseases
killed indigenous peoples of the West Coast (the Bay Area of our
California). However, the Haudenosaunee resist and survive, playing a
formidable role as protagonists advancing global revolution in this
book.

In "Warp and Weft," KSR envisions an encounter between a samurai who
became a rinon (wandering soldier) after abandoning his cruel master
with a council of the Haudenosaunee League. Named Busho, this samurai
had settled on what we would call the West Coast of the U.S. with other
ronin and Japanese settlers, but then the Chinese invaded and destroyed
their community, in their goal of expansion. Busho becomes committed to
preventing "the Chinese \[from\] overrun\[ing\] Turtle Island as they
are overrunning the great world island to the west \[Asia\], if I could
help it." Busho travels east for months to meet the Haudenosaunee, whom
he considers "the first people I had heard of who might be able to
defeat the invasion of the Chinese." Busho remarks that, outside the
Haudenosaunee polity, "Everywhere else in the world, guns rule," and
emperors and despots own the land, enslaving the people (374-5). He then
speaks of the Haudenosaunee alternative:

> "Now, I have watched the Hodenosaunee as closely as a child watches
> its mother. I see how sons are brought up through their motherline,
> and cannot inherit anything from their fathers, so that there can be
> no accumulation of power in any one man. There can be no emperor here.
> I have seen how the women choose the marriages and advise all aspects
> of life, how the elderly and orphans are cared for. How the nations
> are divided into the tribes, woven so that you are all brothers and
> sisters through the league, warp and weft. How the sachems are chosen
> by the people, including the women \[...\]. I have seen how this
> system of affairs brings peace to your league. **It is, in all this
> world, the best system of rule ever invented by human beings.**" (376)

Busho warns the Haudenosaunee of the grave threat posed to this
revolutionary society by Chinese expansionism: if the Chinese are not
resisted, "So it will be, until you look around you, and find there are
foreigners all around you, in your valleys, in forts on your hilltops,
and insisting that they own the land of their farm as if it were their
tobacco pouch, and willing to shoot anyone who kills an animal there, or
cuts a tree. And at that point they will say their law rules your law,
because there are more of them and they have more guns." (379)

Busho emphasizes the geographical advantage the Haudenosaunee possess,
in terms of having a vast ocean dividing them from Asia. He notes this
advantage to be special and even indicative of the millenarian "mission"
of the League as a political example. After smoking considerable
"tobacco," he declares: "You have the finest government on this Earth,
no one else has understood that all are noble, all are part of the One
Mind. But this is a burden too, do you see? You have to carry it--all
the unborn lives to come depend on you! Without you the world would
become a nightmare \[...\]. When the foreigners arrive in their canoes
to take your land, you can face them as one, resist their attacks, take
from them what is useful and reject what is harmful, and stand up to
them as equals on this Earth. I now see what will happen in the time to
come, I see it! \[...\] The people I will become dream now and speak
back to me, through me, they tell me all **the world's people will stand
before the Hodenosaunee in wonder at the justice of its government**.
The story will move from longhouse to longhouse, to everywhere people
are enslaved by rulers, they will speak to each other of the
Hodenosaunee, and of a way things could be, all things shared, all
people given the right to be a part of the running of things, no slaves
and no emperors, no conquest and no submission, people like birds in the
sky. Like eagles in the sky! Oh bring it, oh come the day, oh
oooohhhhhhhh...!" (386)

Though the connection is not made explicit, it is implied in the Years
that Busho's warning to the Haudenosaunee is a critical moment for the
development of subsequent history, for the Haudenosaunee later mount an
effective resistance campaign against the capitalistic Chinese with the
assistance of the anarchistic Travancori League, led by the military
commander Kerala ("The Age of Great Progress, pp. 479-547).
