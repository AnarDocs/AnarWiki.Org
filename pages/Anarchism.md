**Anarchism** is a political theory that aims to create a society which
is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists
maintain that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social
system and so work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social
equality. They see the goals of liberty and equality as mutually
self-supporting.[^1]

Anarchy, is defined by "<a   .md class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> as "the
absence of a master, of a sovereign."[^2] In other words, anarchism is a
political theory which aims to create a society within which individuals
freely co-operate together as equals. As such, anarchism should not be
defined as a "social chaos" or a return to the "laws of the jungle."

Anarchism holds that the state is undesirable, unnecessary, and/or
harmful and advocates a stateless society instead, often based on
self-governed voluntary institutions or non-hierarchical free
associations. Anarchism rejects the state, authoritarianism, and
hierarchical organisation in general.

This process of misrepresentation is not without historical parallel.
For example, in countries which have considered government by one person
(monarchy) necessary, the words republic or democracy have been used in
a manner similar to anarchy, to imply disorder, confusion and chaos.
Those with a vested interest in preserving the status quo will obviously
wish to imply that opposition to the current system cannot work in
practice, and that a new form of society will only lead to chaos. Or, as
Errico Malatesta expresses it:

> since it was thought that government was necessary and that without
> government there could only be disorder and confusion, it was natural
> and logical that anarchy, which means absence of government, should
> sound like absence of order.[^3]

## Key Concepts

### Anarchy

The word "anarchy" is from the Greek, prefix an (or a), meaning "not,"
"the want of," "the absence of," or "the lack of", plus archos, meaning
"a ruler," "director", "chief," "person in charge," or "authority".

**Anarchy** refers to a society, entity, group of people, or a single
person that rejects
"<a   .md class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.

Anarchist theories have a fundamental critique of government, a vision
of a society without government, and a proposed method of reaching such
a society. The details of the political, economic, and social
organization of an anarchist society vary among different branches of
anarchist political thought, as do the proposed means to achieve a
society organized along those lines. However, there are certain
principles shared by all anarchists, most notably the basic principle of
non-hierarchy (in an anarchist society there cannot be any kind of
social hierarchy) and its derivatives, such as the principle of equal
decision-making power (all people must have equal decision-making power
in an anarchist society; if some have more power than others, then a
hierarchy is formed).

Anarchy is the state of having no government. It is distinguished in
political science from anarchism, the belief that anarchy, defined by
them as the absence of major hierarchies such as class and the state,
with power flowing from the bottom up, is the best possible system for
humanity to live under. This causes confusion when self-declared
anarchists protest against government cuts in public spending. Surely,
as believers in the absense of the state, they'd be campaigning for
government cuts in public spending. Another ideology exists, called
'anarcho-capitalism', however, some more left-leaning anarchists would
consider this an oxymoron.

Many political philosophers consider anarchy the original "base state"
of humanity. Some then go on to say that we are much better without
it.[^4] Others consider the natural state to be great but impossible to
return to.[^5]

Anarchy is also the word used to describe a state of chaos, lawlessness
and disorder, frequently seemingly brought about by the lack of
government. However it is important, or at least useful, to decide at
any particular time which definition is being used. Otherwise all
discussion and dialogue will descend into ... anarchy. Anarchists are
generally careful to note that, "No rulers does not mean no rules," as
'no ruler' is the origin of the word 'anarchy'. Subsequently, many
people believe that anarchy is just the removal of the current
government, and not absence of all law.

### Direct Action

**"<a   .md class="wikilink" title="Direct Action">Direct
Action</a>** refers to actions and forms of organising that are
unmediated by authority. It emphasises people taking matters into their
own hands rather than relying on representatives, politicians, or
hierarchical institutions to act on their behalf.

### Mutual Aid

**"<a   .md class="wikilink" title="Mutual Aid">Mutual Aid</a>**
refers to the voluntary cooperation and giving of resources to others
without an expectation of a reward. It differs from charity in that it
is based on reciprocity and solidarity rather than hierarchy, and builds
community power rather than dependence.

### Propaganda by Deed

**"<a   .md class="wikilink"
title="Propaganda of the Deed">Propaganda of the Deed</a>** or
**propaganda of the deed**, is a type of
"<a   .md class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> intended to influence public opinion. The action itself is
meant to serve as an example for others to follow, acting as a catalyst
for "<a   .md class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a>.

### Prefigurative Politics

**"<a   .md class="wikilink"
title="Prefiguration">Prefiguration</a>** is the practice of organising
in ways that reflect the desired future society. Anarchists attempt to
embody non-hierarchical relationships and horizontal decision-making in
their current movements, effectively "building the new world in the
shell of the old."

### Voluntary Association

**Voluntary Association** (or Free Association) is the principle that
individuals should be free to form and dissolve relationships, groups,
and federations based on mutual agreement rather than coercion. This
extends to all aspects of social organisation, from workplaces to
communities.

### Solidarity

**Solidarity** refers to unity and mutual support among individuals and
groups, particularly those facing oppression or exploitation. Unlike
charity, solidarity recognises common interests and involves standing
alongside others in struggle rather than helping from a position of
superiority.

## Internal Debates and Issues

Although Anarchists agree on their opposition to hierarchy, Anarchism is
**not** a unified movement, and different strands of Anarchism debate
the ideal degree of organisation needed, and the best methods of
achieving Anarchism.

    the difference between its early American and European branches.
    Most American individualist anarchists advocated for mutualism,

    advocated for anarchism without adjectives and synthesis anarchism,
    ranging from anarcho-communist to mutualist economic types.
