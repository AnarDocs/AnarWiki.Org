**Zoe Baker** is a British libertarian socialist historian, philosopher,
and educator known for her work popularizing anarchist theory and
history. She holds a PhD on the history of anarchism from the University
of Sheffield and is the author of *Means and Ends: The Revolutionary
Practice of Anarchism in Europe and the United States* (2023).

## Academic Work

Baker completed her PhD at the University of Sheffield, focusing on the
history of anarchism. Her doctoral research examined how historical
anarchists developed coherent revolutionary strategies grounded in a
theory of practice—the understanding that people simultaneously
transform both society and themselves through their activities.

Following her PhD, Baker became a British Academy Postdoctoral Research
Fellow at the University of York, continuing her research on anarchist
history and radical political movements.[^1]

### Writing and Research

Baker's major work, *Means and Ends: The Revolutionary Practice of
Anarchism in Europe and the United States*, was published by AK Press in
2023. The book provides a comprehensive overview of anarchist
revolutionary strategy between 1868 and 1939, examining anarchist views
on direct action, revolution, organization, state socialism, reforms,
and trade unions. Baker demonstrates that anarchist strategic positions
were grounded in a theoretical framework centered on the unity of means
and ends—the principle that revolutionary methods must involve forms of
activity that transform people into individuals capable of both
overthrowing capitalism and the state while building a free society.[^2]

The work has been praised for its clarity and comprehensive research,
with reviewers calling it essential reading for understanding anarchist
history and theory. Baker's approach cuts through common misconceptions
about anarchism, drawing on extensive primary sources from well-known
and obscure anarchist thinkers and movements.

Beyond her book, Baker has written numerous essays and articles on
anarchist theory, including "Means and Ends: The Anarchist Critique of
Seizing State Power" and "Anarchism as a Way of Life". Her work also
engages with Marxist theory and feminism, exploring points of
convergence and divergence between different radical traditions. More
recently, she has begun writing on trans liberation and gender theory,
examining the history and contemporary relevance of gender as a system
of oppression.<ref>Baker, Zoe. "Means and Ends: The Anarchist Critique
