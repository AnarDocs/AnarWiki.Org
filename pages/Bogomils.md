A Christian heresy founded in 10th-century Bulgaria by a priest named
Bogamil, the Bogomils practiced civil disobedience and advocated
anarchism, veganism, and sometimes free love. They allied with the
largely pagan Bulgarian peasantry against the king's attempt to impose
Christianity. As the Bogomils' ideas later spread to Western Europe,
they influenced the

Silvia Federici writes: "The Byzantine authorities were most alarmed by
the Bogomils' 'radical anarchism,' civil disobedience, and class hatred.
As Presbyter Cosmas wrote in his sermons against them: 'They teach their
own people not to obey their masters, they revile the wealthy, hate the
king, ridicule the elders, condemn the boyars, regard as vile in the
eyes of God those who serve the king and forbid every serf to work for
the lord.'"[^2]

Women played a large role in the movement.[^3] Thanks to the influence
of the

the Bogomils discarded their earlier sexual puritanism. Arthur Evans
explains:
