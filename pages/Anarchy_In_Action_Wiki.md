# Anarchy In Action Wiki

Anarchy In Action is an Anarchist wiki at <https://anarchyinaction.org/>

It is inspired by the book, "<a   href="Anarchy_In_Action.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchy In Action">Anarchy In Action</a>, by Colin Ward.

The wiki is a great resource for learning and sharing information about
Anarchist communities, but it does not intend to be a comprehensive
encyclopaedia of Anarchism (and Anarchist views on various issues) such
as AnarWiki strives to be.

AnarWiki includes imports of many Anarchy In Action articles, although
the text of these may change over time as additional information is
added. These are indicated by the Anarchy In Action category.
