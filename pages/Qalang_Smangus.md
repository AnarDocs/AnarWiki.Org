# Qalang Smangus

## Overview

**Qalang Smangus** (Atayal: Qalang Smangus; Chinese: 司馬庫斯部落, Sīmǎ
kù sī) is an
"<a   href="Atayal_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Atayal">Atayal</a>
indigenous community located in the mountains of Hsinchu County,
"<a   href="Taiwan.md" class="wikilink" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, at
approximately 1,500 metres above sea level. Since 2004, the community
has operated as a "<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchist">Christian anarchist</a> collective,
organizing its economy and social structures around principles derived
from the early Christian church described in the
"<a   href="New_Testament.md" class="wikilink" title="New Testament">New
Testament</a> Book of Acts.[^1]

The community of approximately 130-135 residents belongs to the Tayal
Mrqwang lineage and speaks the Squliq dialect of the Atayal language.
Smangus is recognized as one of Taiwan's most remote indigenous
settlements and markets itself to visitors as "God's Tribe."[^2]

## History

### Origins and Early Development

According to Atayal oral tradition, the ancestors of the Smangus
community migrated from Nantou County approximately 400 years ago and
settled in their current mountain location, naming the settlement after
their leader Mangus.[^3]

For decades, the village maintained a traditional subsistence economy
based on mushroom farming, hunting, and cultivation of millet and sweet
potatoes. The community remained without electricity, telephone
services, or road access until the late twentieth century. During the
1970s, aided by United States financial investment in Taiwan's mushroom
industry, the village maintained modest but stable income from mushroom
production.[^4]

### Christianization

In 1951, members of another Atayal tribe who had converted to
"<a   href="Christianity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christianity">Christianity</a> traveled for days to reach Smangus
to share their faith. The village quickly converted, finding resonance
between Christian theology and traditional Atayal beliefs in a heavenly
deity.[^5] The community became part of the
"<a   href="Presbyterian.md" class="wikilink"
title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church tradition. Today,
approximately 90 percent of Atayal people identify as at least nominally
Christian.

The adoption of Christianity by Taiwan's indigenous peoples, including
the Atayal, occurred primarily after 1945 when Han Chinese Christians
fled from mainland China to Taiwan following the
"<a   href="Communist.md" class="wikilink" title="Communist">Communist</a>
victory in the "<a   href="Chinese_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Civil War">Chinese Civil War</a>. Indigenous communities
appropriated Christianity as a means of cultural differentiation and
resistance to assimilation into Han Chinese culture.[^6]

### Modernization and Crisis

The village received electricity in 1979, marking the beginning of
significant social changes. As Smangus became more connected with the
outside world, young people increasingly left to pursue education and
employment opportunities in urban areas. This exodus was accelerated by
the decline of the global mushroom market during the 1980s, as Korean
and Chinese producers competed for market share.[^7] The village's
population declined severely, with only eight families remaining by the
early 1990s.

### Development of Eco-Tourism

In 1991, village leader Icyeh Sulung reported having a dream in which he
believed God promised to bring many visitors to Smangus. Interpreting
this as divine guidance to develop eco-tourism, Icyeh directed villagers
to survey the surrounding area for potential attractions. They
discovered a grove of giant cypress trees, some reportedly over 2,500
years old, located approximately three miles from the village.[^8]

By 1993, Smangus began marketing itself to tourists as an isolated
mountain village with unique environmental assets. The construction of a
main access road in 1995 dramatically increased tourist traffic. During
the Chinese New Year holiday in 1997, approximately 1,200 tourists in
500 vehicles entered Smangus, causing significant environmental and
social disruption.[^9]

The sudden influx of tourist income created internal tensions. Families
with larger land holdings were able to provide more services and secure
greater income shares, while those with fewer assets found themselves
financially disadvantaged. Competition for tourist revenue caused
interpersonal conflicts within the community.[^10] External pressures
also intensified, with developers offering substantial sums to purchase
tribal land, and organized crime groups attempting both bribes and
threats to obtain property.[^11]

### Adoption of Christian Anarchist Organization

By the late 1990s, tribal leader Icyeh Sulung began proposing that
Smangus's economic assets be redistributed to a cooperative organization
and owned collectively by all villagers. Icyeh and other community
members identified the root cause of their disharmony as spiritual and
ethical rather than purely economic, believing that sudden access to
wealth had incited materialistic desire and that unequal distribution
had engendered envy and division.[^12]

Village elders convened extended meetings to discuss restructuring the
entire community based on the social and economic organization of early
Christians as described in Acts 2:44-45 and Acts 4:32, which depict a
community holding all property in common and distributing resources
according to need.[^13]

In 2001, sixteen couples from eight families formed a joint management
group to cooperatively supply food and beverage services to tourists,
sharing income among all participants. This cooperative approach was
extended to accommodation services in 2002.[^14]

In August 2003, nine tribal representatives traveled to Israel to study
kibbutz communities as active models of collectivism. Following their
return, intensive discussions continued regarding collectivization of
privately held land.[^15] On 14 September 2003, representatives of
various households signed an agreement on land and property
collectivization.[^16]

On 5 January 2004, the community formally established a new organization
named Tnunan (meaning "weaving" in Atayal). By this time, 48 individuals
had joined the collective as salaried members, with seven having
initially joined but later withdrawn.[^17]

## Organization and Operation

### Economic Structure

The Tnunan collective operates as a communal economic system where land,
livestock, agricultural assets, and tourism infrastructure are held in
common. Community members receive a monthly salary of approximately
NT\$10,000 (roughly US\$650), along with comprehensive benefits
including healthcare, retirement benefits at age 60, educational funding
through graduate school, and stipends for newborns.[^18]

Work assignments are allocated daily during morning prayer and
devotional meetings held at 8:00 AM at the village coffee shop. During
peak tourist seasons, all available workers are assigned to guesthouses
and restaurants. The community limits daily tourist visitors to 250 to
maintain environmental sustainability.[^19]

Approximately 20 percent of tribal members have chosen not to join the
collective, maintaining private land ownership to operate independent
guesthouses and campsites.[^20]

### Social Regulations

The collective maintains strict behavioral standards. Drinking or
smoking while working, illegal tree cutting, excessive absenteeism, or
skipping church services results in docked pay. Students who skip
classes or earn low grades face suspension of educational funding.
College graduates who wish to work in cities may leave but must work for
one year to repay education costs, and men forfeit land rights upon
departure.[^21]

Members work Monday through Thursday on various tasks including farming,
road maintenance, and food preparation. Saturday and Sunday are
dedicated to serving tourists, while Friday serves as a rest day. The
community provides free meals at a communal restaurant, and most family
expenses including medical bills and school fees are covered by
collective funds.[^22]

### Religious Life

Christian faith remains central to community identity and organization.
Daily activities begin with morning prayer and Scripture study. The
Presbyterian church in the village center serves as a focal point for
both spiritual life and cultural performances for tourists. Saturday
evening cultural shows at the church include traditional dance, worship
songs, and historical presentations by village leaders.[^23]

## Environmental Practices

The community's relationship with the natural environment has evolved
significantly. Historically, Atayal hunting practices in Smangus
sometimes involved exploitation of local wildlife contrary to
traditional *gaga* (tribal ethical principles). Community members have
acknowledged past unsustainable practices, with one resident noting that
his father had killed over twenty bears before dying in what the tribe
interpreted as spiritual retribution.[^24]

The shift to eco-tourism prompted a fundamental reconsideration of
environmental practices. Villagers now focus on conservation activities
including tree planting, prevention of illegal logging, trail
maintenance, and tourist education about local flora and fauna. The
community continues to assert indigenous hunting rights while navigating
tensions with government wildlife conservation efforts.[^25]

## Cultural Preservation

The village elementary school incorporates instruction in tribal
history, Atayal language, and traditional skills including wood carving,
weaving, and millet planting. However, younger generations increasingly
consume media in Chinese rather than Atayal, creating challenges for
language preservation.[^26]

Unlike many other indigenous communities in Taiwan that have experienced
severe depopulation, Smangus has attracted returning members,
particularly young people. Families that had previously left have
returned, drawn by employment opportunities and community cohesion. The
village currently comprises 35 families, and in contrast to Taiwan's low
national fertility rate of 1.13 children per woman, most Smangus
families have at least three children.[^27]

## Anarchist Character

Scholars have characterized Smangus as representing a form of
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a> based on its
organizational principles. The community's structure draws explicitly
from Biblical descriptions of early Christian communities that practiced
common ownership of property and egalitarian distribution of resources.
Professor Lisa Kemmerer notes that the Book of Acts portrays early
Christian communities as communal, comparable to ideal anarchist
communities described by theorists such as
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>,
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, and
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a>.[^28]

Peter Marshall, in his history of anarchism, observes that the account
in Acts provides solid grounds for believing that first-century
Christians practiced a form of communism and usufruct.[^29] Roman
Montero argues that early Christians treated property as genuinely
common, with no individual claiming private ownership.[^30]

The extent to which Smangus should be classified specifically as
anarchist rather than communalist, mutualist, or collectivist remains
subject to scholarly discussion. The community's voluntary nature,
democratic decision-making processes, and absence of hierarchical state
control align with anarchist principles, while its explicit religious
foundation and communal cultural traditions distinguish it from secular
anarchist experiments.[^31]

## Significance

Smangus represents a rare contemporary example of an indigenous
community successfully implementing collectivist economic organization
while maintaining cultural identity and achieving economic stability
within a capitalist state context. The community demonstrates the
possibility of anarchist social organization functioning sustainably
when rooted in shared religious conviction and cultural values.

The success of Smangus has generated interest regarding potential
replication among other Taiwanese indigenous communities. However,
observers note that the unique circumstances of Smangus including its
geographic isolation, strong Christian identity, and unified response to
external threats may limit direct transferability of its model.[^32]
