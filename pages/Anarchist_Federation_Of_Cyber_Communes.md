The AF2C (Anarchist Federation of Cyber Communes)[^1] is an effort to
link existing and new organisations that operate according to Anarchist
principles. Our mission is to facilitate the creation and growth of
active communities, to amplify anarchist voices, and to occupy the web
with an anarchist presence.

# The Cyber-Anarchist Manifesto

The Anarchist Federation of Cyber Communes is another chapter in the
struggle against oppression, one which honours and builds on the web's
anarchist traditions. We envision the web as a medium through which we
can share anarchist insights, organize among already existing online and
offline structures all while using this space to implement an anarchist
society.

## 1. Spreading Anarchist Principles

### 1.1. Expanding beyond "Western"-centric Anarchism

The web has allowed for completely different parts of the world to come
into contact like no other means of communication has before. This gives
the Anarchist community the opportunity of listening and amplifying the
views and analyses of Anarchism beyond this movement's western roots.
There are many contributions from Anarchists from all around the world
which are both not accessible or widely shared. There also are active
Anarchists whose struggle is not widely known about for which Anarchists
around the world should rise. We already have a very international
movement, this a characteristic which is both intrinsic to our ideology
and for which the web is uniquely poised to act on. We must make sure
that anyone, anywhere can identify with Anarchism.

### 1.2. Accessibility

This is a public education project. In the context of our heavily
indoctrinated society, Anarchist ideals are not immediately accessible
to the general public. First you need to overcome all the stigma of even
considering Anarchism beyond what the word means in the popular
consciousness. Second you need to understand the Anarchist principles to
a reasonable level. Thirdly and perhaps most difficultly, you need to
manage to effectively apply these principles. Various projects on the
web have already made this process more accessible and many of us would
not be radicalised if it weren't for the current Anarchist presence. We
want to keep a strong presence and improve the education of baby
Anarchists.

## 2. Federating the Web

### 2.1. Existing organizations

Our project is not the first appearance of Anarchism on the web nor does
it claim to be. The Anarchist sphere is already active on every social
media platform with lively discussions of Anarchist theory, talk of past
as well as current Anarchist or Anarchist adjacent real world events and
exciting new ideas. We have websites for Anarchist news, dusty online
libraries, places to participate in mutual aid, etc. This vibrant
ecosystem is the result of years of work from Anarchists across the
world and much of the inspiration for this project. We do not wish to
replace it, but to build on it. The goal of the federation is to pool
these forces together to centralise information and be able to
coordinate larger initiatives in an accessible and transparent manner
while keeping the decentralised nature and the ability to associate
freely that already exists in this movement. Concretely this means that
this space is for organising in between "communes" i.e organisations and
to create web-wide initiatives. Should a new Anarchist project be
launched, this should be a good place to find people who adhere to it
and who are willing to work on it.

### 2.2. Linking offline and online

Many current online Anarchist organisations lack a real anchoring in the
offline Anarchist community while many offline Anarchist organisations
have a merely superficial presence online. With the AFCC, we want to
bridge the gap so that we can operate more effectively in both spaces.

## 3. Our Web

### 3.1 Taking Back our Space

The web has an Anarchist tradition. In between open-source software,
collaborative websites, and freely available resources our predecessors
have created an oasis which we have maintained and improved. But this
space has also been degraded and corrupted. We now live in an era where
there are monopolies on all facets of this space from the hardware side
to the software side. We are reaching a stage where every aspect of the
web is commercialised from our private lives to the information search
engines give us. The web has also become a tool of mass state
surveillance and fascist political indoctrination. These developments
are the result of the capitalist, statist, and colonial logic of our
society. They are not an inherent feature of the web.

### 3.2 The Web an Organizational Tool for an Anarchist Revolution

We can do more than simply free the web. Even under the current system,
the web is an amazing tool to spread information, organise effectively
and discuss. The web is a blueprint for an Anarchist society. Just like
how Anarcho-Syndicalists see the workers union as a structure through
which we can implement an Anarchist revolution, we see the world wide
web as a structure capable of much the same. Concretely, we think that
we can set up the features of an Anarchist society online which would
allow us to create an experiment on a much larger scale than ever
attempted before. By creating an Anarchist society without having to
conquer any offline space, we would be able to prove the concept of an
Anarchist society without having to deal with many of the threats that
previous experiments have met. Granted it would be more than bold to
assume that such a leap is possible in the current form. By setting up
this organisation, we want to make that vision possible.
