# Early Christians

title="Early Israelites">Early Israelites</a> and "influenced influenced
by <a href="Essenes.md" class="wikilink" title="Essenian models">Essenian
models</a>"[^1] were the Jewish communistic followers of Yeshua (ישוע).
Translated into the Greek Iesous, then the Latin Iesus, he is commonly
known today as Jesus.

Jesus was born between 6 and 4 BCE, and his followers probably believed
he had an ordinary human birth. Claims of his mother's virginity arrived
"quite late, found only in Matthew and Luke, written in the last two
decades of the first century. Neither Mark, the earliest gospel, nor
Paul, the earliest writer in the New Testament, speak of Jesus's special
birth. Nor does the gospel of John. If stories of Jesus's miraculous
birth were important and early in early Christianity, it is difficult to
imagine their absence from Mark, Paul, John, and the rest of the New
Testament."[^2]

Emphasizing Jesus's anti-colonial themes, Hyam MacCoby argued that the
movement's beliefs were traditionally Jewish and that New Testament
passages exaggerated their break with orthodoxy. For example:

> When Jesus drank wine and broke bread at the Last Supper, he was doing
> what a Jew does every time he performs the Kiddush ceremony before a
> Festival or Sabbath meal. When Jesus began his prayer with "Our Father
> that art in heaven..." he was following the pattern of Pharisee
> prayers which still form part of the Jewish Daily Prayer Book. When he
> spoke in parables and used startling phrases (such as "swallow a
> camel" or "the beam in thine own eye") he was using methods of
> expression familiar to any student of the Talmudic writings. At the
> same time, a Jew reading the Gospels is immediately aware of aspects
> which do not seem authentic; for example, the accounts of Pharisees
> wanting to kill Jesus because he healed on the Sabbath. The Pharisees
> never included healing in their list of activities forbidden on the
> Sabbath; and Jesus's methods of healing did not involve any of the
> activities that were forbidden. It is unlikely that they would have
> disapproved, even mildly, of Jesus's Sabbath-healing.[^3]

Jesus taught a communistic and anarchistic message. The first
Christians, Erich Fromm argues, "were imbued with hatred and contempt
for the educated rich and rulers, in short for all authority."[^4] Karl
Kautsky describes Jesus's attitude as "a fierce class hatred against the
rich." As evidence, Kautsky presents some of Jesus's sayings in the New
Testament: "For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye,
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." "Blessed be ye
poor: for yours is the kingdom of God." "Go to now, ye rich men, weep
and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are
corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is
cankered: and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall
eat your flesh as it were fire."[^5]

"Jesus never calls upon anyone to work," explains Jacques Ellul. "On the
contrary, he constantly takes the men he calls away from their work,
e.g., Peter, James, Levi, the man in the parable who wants to try out
his oxen, and so forth. It is possible that Jesus worked, but this is by
no means certain, and even if he did, it proves nothing. Like others he
obeys the necessities of human life." From Ellul's perspective, Jesus's
indifference towards work builds on Judaism's notion of the sabbath as
"a sign of liberation.[^6]

Egalitarian beliefs were put into practice through a horizontal
organizing structure. Among the early Christians, according to Erich
Fromm, "there was not even a clearly defined external authority" and
there existed protection of "the independence and freedom of the
individual Christian with respect to matters of faith." It was only by
the second century CE that the Christians committed to several
centralizing and authoritarian directions:

> "This fundamental transformation of Christianity from the religion of
> the oppressed to the religion of the rulers and of the masses
> manipulated by them, from the expectation of the imminent approach of
> judgment day and the new age to a faith in the already consummated
> redemption; from the postulate of a pure, moral life to satisfaction
> of conscience through ecclesiastical means of grace; from hostility to
> the state to cordial agreement with it--all this is closely conected
> with the final great change \[...\] Christianity, which had been the
> religion of a community of equal brothers, without hierarchy or
> bureaucracy, became 'the Church,' the reflected image of the absolute
> monarchy of the Roman Empire."[^7]

As a corresponding theological change, according to Fromm, Christians
went from believing Jesus was a man who became God to believing Jesus
was the Son of God all along. The former interpretation, by saying a
human can become divine, contained a radical interpretation of God's
permanent authority.[^8]

Although the early Christians were mainly free proletarians, it's
likely, according to Kautsky, that they shared the Essenes' opposition
to slavery. However, Christianity's institutionalization did away with
any explicit opposition to slavery. Kautsky describes a "decline of
communism" among the movement.[^9] By 312 CE, Christianity became the
official religion of the very Roman Empire against which Jesus and his
followers had rebelled.

The influence of the early Christians on anti-authoritarians has been
extremely vast, including on the
