# Statism

**Statism** or **etatism** (from French *état*, meaning 'state') is the
doctrine that political authority of the state is legitimate. The term
encompasses any political philosophy that accepts the state as a
necessary or beneficial form of social organisation, ranging from
minimal state positions to totalitarian systems. Statism stands in
direct opposition to anarchism, which rejects all forms of hierarchical
authority.

## Overview

Statism manifests across a broad spectrum of political systems. At its
most minimal, positions like minarchism advocate for a "night-watchman
state" limited to courts, police and military functions. The welfare
state represents a middle ground, with the state taking responsibility
for social services. At the extreme end, authoritarian and totalitarian
systems concentrate maximum power in state institutions.

All forms of statism share a common foundation: the belief that some
group of people should hold authority over others through the mechanism
of the state. This authority is maintained through a monopoly on
legitimate violence, backed by military and police forces. Whether
democratic or autocratic, statist systems create a fundamental division
between those who govern and those who are governed.

Anarchist critique recognizes that the state, by its nature, "stands
outside the people and above them."[^1] The state represents "government
of society from above downward"[^2] rather than federated organisation
from below. Even in democratic systems, the act of electing
representatives merely determines which individuals will hold power over
the population, without abolishing the hierarchical relationship itself.

## Origins

The term "statism" gained widespread use in American political discourse
during the 1930s and 1940s, though the concept existed long before. The
modern state emerged alongside capitalism, with theorists like John
Locke developing justifications for state power during the Enlightenment
period. These liberal theories framed the state as protecting property
rights and individual liberties, though anarchists note this protection
primarily served the propertied classes.

Statist thinking has deeper roots in religious and monarchical systems,
where authority flowed from divine sources through kings and priests to
the general population. The transition to secular states merely replaced
divine justification with concepts like "popular sovereignty" and
"social contract," but maintained the hierarchical structure.

The Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin wrote his major critique of
statism, *Statism and Anarchy*, in 1873. This work laid out the
anarchist case against all state forms and prophetically warned of the
dangers inherent in Marxist proposals for a "workers' state."

## Forms of Statism

### Economic Statism

Economic statism promotes state direction of major economic activities,
either directly through state-owned enterprises and central planning, or
indirectly through regulation and intervention in markets.

State capitalism features high concentrations of state-owned enterprises
or state direction of capitalist economies. Historical examples include
France's dirigiste system and contemporary China. Anarchists argue that
state capitalism merely replaces private capitalists with state
bureaucrats while maintaining the exploitation of workers.

State socialism refers to systems based on state ownership of the means
of production. The Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc countries, and other
communist states exemplified this form. Critics note these systems
created new ruling classes of party bureaucrats and state managers,
confirming Bakunin's prediction that "the people will feel no better if
the stick with which they are being beaten is labelled the 'peoples
stick.'"[^3]

State interventionism in market economies involves regulation and
provision of services within a capitalist framework. The welfare state
represents this tendency, with the state acting to moderate capitalism's
worst effects while preserving the underlying system of wage labour and
private ownership.

### Political Statism

All political ideologies that accept the legitimacy of state power
qualify as statist, from liberal democracy to fascism to authoritarian
communism. The differences lie in who controls the state apparatus and
for what stated purposes, but all maintain the fundamental hierarchy
between government and governed.

Democratic statism claims to give power to "the people" through
elections and representation. Anarchists reject this as a fiction,
noting that "if it truly were the case that the 'entire nation will
rule' then 'no one will be ruled. Then there will be no government, no
state.'"[^4] In practice, "popular government" means "government of the
people by a small number of representatives elected by the people."[^5]

Representative democracy creates a new ruling class from "former
workers, who, as soon as they become rulers or representatives of the
people will cease to be workers and will begin to look upon the whole
workers' world from the heights of the state."[^6] Power corrupts those
who hold it, regardless of their original class position or intentions.

State nationalism equates state identity with national identity and
values state authority above individual or community autonomy.
Historical examples include Soviet nationalism, Kemalism, Francoism, and
various forms of authoritarian nationalism that mobilize nationalist
sentiment to strengthen state power.

## Anarchist Critique

The anarchist position opposes all forms of statism on both practical
and ethical grounds. The state, by its nature, concentrates power in the
hands of a minority who govern the majority. This creates inherent
tendencies toward corruption, oppression, and the perpetuation of class
divisions.

### The State as Instrument of Class Rule

While recognizing that modern states defend capitalist interests,
anarchists reject economic reductionism. The state has interests of its
own beyond serving any particular economic class. Bakunin noted that in
places like Turkish Serbia, economically dominant classes "do not even
exist – there is only a bureaucratic class. Thus, the Serbian state will
crush the Serbian people for the sole purpose of enabling Serbian
bureaucrats to live a fatter life."[^7]

State structures create their own privileged classes regardless of
economic system. The "dictatorship of the proletariat" proposed by
Marxists would merely establish "the highly despotic government of the
masses by a new and very small aristocracy of real or pretended
scholars."[^8] This prediction proved accurate in the Bolshevik state,
where party hierarchies concentrated production "under the direct
command of state engineers, who will form a new privileged scientific
and political class."[^9]

### Reformism and Electoral Politics

Statism leads inexorably toward reformism when revolutionary movements
engage with electoral politics. Bakunin correctly predicted that Marxist
participation in parliamentary systems would mean "endless accommodation
with governments and the various bourgeois political parties."[^10] The
history of social democracy confirmed this analysis, as revolutionary
parties transformed into defenders of the capitalist state.

Electoral participation creates illusions that the state can be captured
and used for working class interests. In reality, the hierarchical
structure of the state ensures that those elected become separated from
the class they claim to represent. "By popular government \[Marxists\]
mean government of the people by a small number of representatives
elected by the people." This constitutes "a lie behind which the
despotism of a ruling minority is concealed."[^11]

### Historical Record

The contrast between statist and anarchist practice demonstrates the
danger of concentrated power:

"Anarchists did not try to carry out genocide against the Armenians in
Turkey; they did not deliberately starve millions of Ukrainians; they
did not create a system of death camps to kill Jews, gypsies, and Slavs
in Europe; they did not fire-bomb scores of large German and Japanese
cities and drop nuclear bombs on two of them; they did not carry out a
'Great Leap Forward' that killed scores of millions of Chinese; they did
not attempt to kill everybody with any appreciable education in
Cambodia; they did not launch one aggressive war after another; they did
not implement trade sanctions that killed perhaps 500,000 Iraqi
children. In debates between anarchists and statists, the burden of
proof clearly should rest on those who place their trust in the state.
Anarchy's mayhem is wholly conjectural; the state's mayhem is
undeniably, factually horrendous."[^12]

## Alternatives to Statism

Anarchists propose federated systems of workers' councils and communes
as alternatives to state power. Such systems would be organized "from
below upward, by the people themselves, dispensing with all governments
and parliaments – a voluntary alliance of agricultural and factory
worker associations, communes, provinces, and nations."[^13]

A "federal organisation, from below upward, of workers' associations,
groups, communes, districts, and ultimately, regions and nations"
differs fundamentally from "centralised states" and would be "contrary
to their essence."[^14] This would create "real as opposed to fictitious
freedom" through the end of "sham popular sovereignty."[^15]

The basis would be self-managed production with "co-operation being the
just mode of future production" and "all forms of land and capital"
becoming "collective property."[^16] This vision of bottom-up,
federated, self-managed libertarian socialism represents "a popular
federation with it based on emancipated labour and collective
property."[^17]

Revolutionary change cannot be achieved "by the orders of any authority,
even an elected one... but as the natural development of all the varied
demands put forth by life itself."[^18] No scholar can "define for
himself how they will and must live on the morrow of the social
revolution. That will be determined first by the situation of each
people, and secondly by the desires that manifest themselves and operate
most strongly within them."[^19]

## Statism and Anarchy (Book)

*Statism and Anarchy* (Russian: *Государственность и анархия*,
*Gosudarstvennost' i anarkhiia*) was Mikhail Bakunin's last major work,
written in summer 1873. The book addresses the impact of the
Franco-Prussian War and rise of the German Empire on European politics,
critiques Marxist theory, and affirms anarchist principles.

This was Bakunin's only major anarchist work written in Russian, aimed
primarily at a Russian audience. An initial print run of 1,200 copies
was printed in Switzerland and smuggled into Russia. The work "helped to
lay the foundations of a Russian anarchist movement as a separate
current within the revolutionary stream."[^20]

The book's central argument posits that the state will always obstruct
the establishment of a classless society. Those who constitute a state,
regardless of ideology, inevitably form a ruling class. Democratic
structures do not resolve this problem, as they merely determine which
individuals will govern rather than abolishing the hierarchical
relationship between governors and governed.

Bakunin's critique of Marx's "dictatorship of the proletariat" proved
prophetic. He warned that a revolutionary state would concentrate power
in the hands of party bureaucrats who would cease to identify with the
working class they claimed to represent. The Bolshevik experience
validated these concerns, as party hierarchies created new forms of
oppression while claiming to act in workers' interests.

The book also addresses the question of peasant involvement in
revolution. Bakunin recognized that industrial workers formed a minority
of the population, with most working people being artisans and peasants.
A revolution placing only the industrial proletariat in power would
disenfranchise the majority and could not create a free society. The
Bolsheviks' skewing of soviet representation toward urban workers,
followed by their alienation of the peasantry, confirmed this analysis.
