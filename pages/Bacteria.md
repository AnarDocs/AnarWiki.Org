Bacteria are a singled-celled life form. Along with archea, bacteria are
prokaryotic, meaning their cells do not have a distinct nucleus with a
membrane. Bacteria reproduce uniparentally (from just one parent), when
a cell divides into two, or when a small bud leaves the cell and
eventually becomes the size of its parent.[^1] Due to global bacteria's
extensive cooperation and gene-sharing, scientists and scholars have
sometimes referred to bacteria as an example of decentralized mutual
aid.

Through a process known as *horizontal gene transfer*, bacteria cells
around the world so extensively swap genes with other that the
biologists Sorin Sonea and Maurice Panisset referred to the world's
bacteria as a giant superorganism.[^2] The swapping of genes has allowed
bacteria to survive in a variety of extreme climates for billions of
years. A team led by Bill Martin found that some 80 percent of genes in
the bacteria genome had at some point arrived through horizontal gene
transfer.[^3]

Examining this gene swapping, Margulis and Sagan stress that bacteria
function as "a sort of worldwide decentralized democracy."

They go onto support a global federation of communities based on the
example of bacterial symbiosis. Graham Purchase comments, "This vision
has much in common with that of many prominent 19th century anarchist
thinkers, notably Elisee Reclus and Peter Kropotkin."[^4]

Bacteria have played a number of beneficial roles for other life-forms.
They invented photosynthesis. They are crucial for humans' digestive
systems, and for soil maintenance in forests and on farms. Many
antibiotics come from bacteria. Reportedly, "Life on Earth would die out
faster if organisms in the Superkingdom Prokarya \[Bacteria\] became
extinct than if any of the other life-forms disappeared."[^5] According
to widely accepted scientific theory, bacterial cells have entered,
through horizontal gene transfer over the course of roughly two billion
years, into the genomes of all animal cells including human cells."[^6]
