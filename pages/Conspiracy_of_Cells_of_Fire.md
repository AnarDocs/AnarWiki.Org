Conspiracy of Cells of Fire (CCF) emerged with simultaneous arsons in
Greece on 21 January 2008 targeting cars, banks, and a power
company.[^1] The CCF's emergence can be understood as a militant subset
of the <a href="2008_Greek_insurrection" class="wikilink"
title="2008 Greek insurrection">2008 Greek insurrection</a>. They have
expressed support for the
<a href="Informal_Anarchist_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Informal Anarchist Federation">Informal Anarchist Federation</a>,
<a href="Animal_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">Animal Liberation Front</a>, and
<a href="Earth_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a>.

Rejecting Marxism and class-struggle Anarchism, the CCF has described
its philosophy as anarcho-nihilist:

> "Anarcho-nihilism combines the propaganda of words with the propaganda
> of shootings, fire, dynamite. Its dynamics is forged on the anvil of
> actions where consciousness and experience meet in a never ending
> dance and not in the keyboards of the digital world of noting."[^2]

A CCF member has clarified the movement's deep-green ecological
philosophy:

> "We live in concrete cages that we call apartments. We walk among
> strangers. Highways are the veins of a system where people, goods and
> money circulate together, all mixed up. All those in the name of
> profit. We have mass entertainment with technological substitutes. We
> communicate via keyboards. We fall in love through screens. We desire
> through showcases. The funny thing is that man once thought that with
> the technological revolution they would be liberated. But, in fact,
> their technological revolution put on new velvet shackles,
> technological shackles. Our life itself, if you notice, is poisoned on
> a daily basis by plastic food, by flue gas, by radioactivity, by
> laboratory diseases, by drugs. At the same time, the natural wealth,
> the forests are being destroyed, burnt, cut down to either become
> housing estates, highways or department stores. Our very existence,
> our individuality, since we are talking about technology, is being
> violated by the technopolice. Our movements are recorded through the
> electronic camera eyes. Our habits, our desires, our tastes, our
> hobbies, are stored on hard drives, on credit cards, on the internet,
> in a huge data warehouse that we find ourselves. These are the
> achievements of technology. Animals are being captured and killed,
> either in the context of laboratory experiments on technological
> development or, even worse, on human aesthetic choices. That is, they
> are transformed into bags, shoes and clothes. All this shows that the
> so-called quality – because the defenders of technology and the
> industrial complex emphasize that all this has offered the quality of
> life – must now crush any other form of life, in the name of the new
> man-god. That is, anything that happens today is a catastrophic human
> endeavor against anything that is not human. Against the whole planet
> earth."[^3]
