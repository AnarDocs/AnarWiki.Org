**Socialist Burkina Faso** refers to
"<a   href="Burkina_Faso.md" class="wikilink" title="Burkina Faso">"Burkina
Faso</a> from 1983 to 1987, which had a government led by
"<a   href="Thomas_Sankara.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Sankara">"Thomas
Sankara</a>. Ideologically a "<a   href="Marxist-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">"Marxist-Leninist</a> society, there were fairly
large programmes for social, ecological, and economic change were
launched before it met a quick doom at the hands of

## Positives

- The country was renamed from Upper Volta (a name given by the
  "<a   href="French_Empire.md" class="wikilink" title="French Empire">"French
  Empire</a>) to Burkina Faso, meaning 'land of incorruptible people'. A
  new national flag and anthem were also given, written personally by
  Thomas Sankara.
- The rights and properties of tribal chiefs as land reform was enacted,
  giving peasants huge amounts of land and freeing them from tribute
  payments and forced labour.
- Land reform combined with state-sponsored irrigation programs and
  fertiliser provision led to the average wheat production for
  the Sahel region increasing by 250% from 1,700kg of wheat per hectare
  to 3,900kg of wheat per hectare. This not only led to food
  self-sufficiency, but food surplus.
- Mass vaccination programs led to 2.5 million Burkinabé being
  vaccinated against polio, meningitis and measles in a week.
- Brick factories were created to help build houses in effort to end
  urban slums.
- 7,000 tree nurseries were created that helped lead to 10 million trees
  being planted to help reforest the Sahel desert.
- All regions of the country were soon connected by a vast road- and
  rail-building program. Over 700 km (430 mi) of rail was laid by
  Burkinabé people to facilitate manganese extraction in "The Battle of
  the Rails" without any foreign aid or outside money.
- Female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy were banned.
- Women were appointed to high governmental positions and encouraged to
  work outside the home and stay in school even if pregnant.
- Contraception was promoted by the state and husbands were encouraged
  husbands to go to market and prepare meals to experience for
  themselves the conditions faced by women.
- The government fleet of Mercedes cars were sold off and the Renault 5
  (the cheapest car sold in Burkina Faso at the time) became the
  official service car of government minister.
- The salaries of well-off public servants (including Sankara's) and
  forbade the use of government chauffeurs and first class airline
  tickets were forbidden.
- The first supermarket in the country was opened, being converted from
  an old military supply store.
- Well-off civil servants were forced to pay one month's salary to
  public projects.

## Negatives

- The system of courts known as 'Popular Revolutionary Tribunals' were
  corrupt and oppressive.
- The armed militias known as 'Revolutionary Defense Committees' quickly
  became corrupt and were used for personal gain by members, a failure
  so bad even Sankara acknowledged it.
- Given Sankara's taking of power through a coup and failure to properly
  decentralise power, he was "<a   href="Hydra_Hypothesis.md" class="wikilink"
  title="easily vulnerable">"easily vulnerable</a> to being deposed in
  another coup.
- Unlike other Marxist-Leninist governments, the government failed to
  reduce the country's large illiteracy problem, having fired thousands
  of teachers after large strikes.
- The growth of life expectancy began to stagnate compared to previous
  years.
