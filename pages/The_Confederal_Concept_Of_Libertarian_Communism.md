## Historical Context

The document, "The confederal concept of libertarian communism," is a
transcription of the resolution debated and approved at the National
Congress of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) in Zaragoza in
May 1936, just months before the Spanish Revolution and Civil War. This
text was intended to guide the anarchist experiments of the revolution
and outlines a practical programme for an anarchist society, tailored to
Spain's needs in 1936-1937, while allowing for flexibility and future
adaptation.

The translator added the following caveat: "This document, which guided
the anarchist experiments of the 1936 Spanish Revolution, has multiple
precepts that many of us anarchists would disagree with today. Aside
from those flaws, I personally regard this document as an important text
in the history of freedom ideas and a text that should be seriously
considered by people, newcomers and seasoned, who have fallen in love
with the anarchist ideal."

### Core Principles and Vision

- The resolution aimed to establish broad outlines for libertarian
  communism, drawing from various conceptual tendencies within the CNT
  while maintaining unity. It was presented as a resolution, not a rigid
  programme or closed dogma, allowing for future transformations based
  on needs and experience.
- It declared the abolition of private property, the State, the
  principle of Authority, and consequently, the division of society into
  exploiters and exploited.
- The fundamental principles of libertarian communism were stated as:
  - Giving to every human being that which he needs, with limits only by
    the necessities of the newly created economy.
  - Soliciting from every human being the maximum contribution of their
    efforts, based on their physical and moral conditions and society's
    necessities.
- Individual sovereignty was implicitly recognised and confirmed as a
  guarantee of social harmony. The concept stressed that abundance is
  indispensable for a progressive collective life and that communism
  would be a natural result of it.

### Organisation of the New Society

- The <a href="Libertarian_Commune" class="wikilink"
  title="Libertarian Commune">Libertarian Commune</a> was proposed as
  the political and administrative entity and the basis of the new
  social mechanism, operating autonomously and federating regionally and
  nationally. Communes were to manage local resources, coordinate
  services, and stimulate cultural activities.
- Producers' Organisations (Syndicates) were tasked with directly
  administering production and consumption at workplaces. They were seen
  as the "embryo of the future" and the basis for the organisation of
  work.
- A federalist structure was outlined, moving from the individual to the
  collective:
  - Individual as the cornerstone.
  - Workshop and Factory Councils as connective organs within the
    Commune and workplace.
  - Statistics and Production Councils federating syndicates of
    producers.
  - Council of Cultivation in the countryside, guiding agricultural
    production.
  - These would connect to Local, Regional, and National Federations of
    Communes and Industrial/Agricultural Producers' Associations.
  - A Confederal Council of Production and Distribution would be created
    for overall distributive function.
- Decentralisation was emphasised for certain activities like
  construction, allowing for local conditions and styles to be
  respected, while national coordination was deemed necessary for
  interconnected industries like energy and transport.

### Economic and Social Aspects

- Work was defined as both a right and an obligation. The revolution
  would suppress parasitism, ensuring no one lives by others' toil. It
  also recognised the productive nature of intellectual and technical
  labour, not just manual.
- **Exchange of Products:** Communal Councils and Statistics and
  Production Councils would manage exchange. A production card
  (non-transferable, valid for a year, recording work value) was
  proposed as an exchange symbol for working individuals, while communal
  councils would provide consumption cards for non-working parts of the
  population (children, aged, sick). The system was envisioned to
  eliminate middlemen and private commerce.
- **Justice and Crime:** Criminal behaviour was largely attributed to
  social injustice under capitalism. Libertarian communism would
  eliminate correctional regimes, relying on medicine and education to
  address disequilibrium and promote social responsibility.
- **Family and Sexual Relations:** The family would not be violently
  opposed, but the economic independence of individuals would lead to
  equality between sexes. Free love was proclaimed, with collective
  security for children and the application of biological-eugenic
  principles for species selection.
- **Religion:** To be relegated to individual conscience, without public
  ostentation or coercion.
- **Education, Art, and Science:** A radical approach to education was
  advocated, combating illiteracy and providing free, scientific, and
  equal education for both sexes. The aim was to form individuals with
  their own opinions, cultivating all faculties, and eliminating
  punishment/reward systems. Access to science, art, and investigation
  would be free for all, outside of productive hours.

### Defence of the Revolution

- The necessity to defend revolutionary conquests was admitted,
  especially given the potential for foreign capitalist invasion or
  internal counter-revolution.
- A permanent army was rejected as a danger to the revolution; instead,
  the People Armed would serve as the best guarantee. Communes would
  maintain armaments and defensive elements.
- Emphasis was placed on international propaganda among the proletariat
  to garner solidarity against invasions.

### Actions Taken at the Congress

- The resolution was unanimously approved by the congressists.
- An amendment was approved and attached to the resolution. This
  amendment called for a committee of five comrades to elaborate a more
  complete and technically advised resolution, adhering to the general
  outline and principles, within two months. This detailed resolution
  would then be subject to a referendum of the syndicates for final
  approval or rejection.
- Specific proposals for adding details (e.g., from Liberal
  Professionals on Education) were acknowledged for their spirit but
  deferred to the appointed committee, to avoid turning the general
  outline into a "closed dogma" and to prevent the distortion of the
  resolution's general spirit.
- The Draft Committee's delicate situation in adjusting different
  conceptions to form a unified resolution was acknowledged.
