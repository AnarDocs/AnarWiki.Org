The Weather Underground Organization (first known as Weatherman or the
Weathermen) was a militant anti-war group in the “United States” from
1969 to 1977 that carried out many acts of vandalism against government
and corporate property. They expected to inspire large numbers of
Americans to replicate their actions, but they never acquired popular
support. Contrary to assertions of “terrorism,” the Weather Underground
did not physically harm human beings, aside from three of their own
members who died in an accidental bomb explosion.

The group adhered to a Maoist ideology and has been sharply critiqued by
anti-authoritarians for its vanguardism. Still, to some degree the
Weathermen’s diversity of tactics and strategy of “bringing the war
home” influenced later generations of militants.

Weather Underground member Mark Rudd reflected in a 2009 memoir:

> Much of what the Weather men did had the opposite effect of what we
> intended. We deorganized SDS while we claimed we were making it
> stronger; we isolated ourselves from our friends and allies as we
> helped split the larger antiwar movement around the issue of violence.
> In general, we played into the hands of the FBI—our sword enemies. We
> might as well have been on their payroll. As if all this weren’t
> enough, three of my friends died in an accidental explosion while
> assembling bombs.[^1]

# Structure and Ideology

The Weather Underground organized as semi-autonomous collectives, each
with about twelve people living together. Coordinating the collectives,
a centralized leadership called the Weather Bureau was comprised of all
men, except for Bernardine Dohrn. When Weathermen were arrested in the
1969 “Days of Rage,” the organization immediately bailed out
higher-ranking members and left others in jail for months. This
differential treatment prompted Rudd to reflect, “Weatherman was nothing
if not hierarchical.”[^2]

The Weathermen intended for the collectives to eventually organize
Americans into a Marxist-Leninist political party.[^3]

Weatherman adopted the 1968 SDS slogan “Bring the War home” and aimed to
disrupt the US empire from within. They saw US imperialism as the
primary enemy and considered Third World and black struggles to be the
revolutionary vanguard. The organization dismissed the revolutionary
potential of the white working class, thinking white workers had a
rational interest in maintaining their white privilege. Weatherman went
to extreme lengths to isolate themselves from the American population,
going so far as to adopt the slogan “Fight the people!”[^4] They had
debates over whether it was okay to kill white babies, and Dohrn made a
speech praising the serial killer Charles Manson.[^5]

Life in the collectives included extensive “self-criticism” sessions in
which members would spend hours criticizing someone for not living up to
their puritanical ideal. There was an expectation that members would
eschew monogamous relationships in favor of extensive sexual
experimentation with many partners.[^6]

# Origins

The Weathermen started as a faction of Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the leading anti-war coalition in the United States in the 1960s.
By the time of its 1969 national conference, SDS was dominated by three
Marxist-Leninist factions. Relatively marginal within SDS, Anarchists
distributed a pamphlet by Murray Bookchin criticizing the dominant
factions for clinging to an outdated ideology. It was titled “Listen,
Marxist!”:

> “All the old crap of the thirties is coming back again—the shit about
> the ‘class line,’ the ‘role of the working class,’ the ‘trained
> cadres,’ the ‘vanguard party,’ and the the ‘proletarian dictatorship.’
> \[…\] When the hell are we finally going to create a movement that
> looks to the future instead of the past?”[^7]

The 1969 conference became the site of a power struggle between Maoist
factions including Progressive Labor (PL) and the Weathermen. The former
rejected youth counterculture and black nationalism, while the latter
supported both. Borrowing a line from a Bob Dylan song, the Weathermen
circulated their manifesto “You Don’t Need a Weatherman to Know Which
Way the Wind Blows.” It called for a white youth vanguard to engage in
underground actions in support of black and Third World revolution.

# Days of Rage

In the summer of 1969, the Weathermen moved into collective houses and
began heavily promoting the “Days of Rage” that would kick off in
Chicago on 8 October 1969.[^8] They hoped that thousands of people would
show up and brawl with police. Members publicized the initiative on
college campuses and even commandeered high school classrooms in
attempts to recruit people.[^9] A few days before the action, Weatherman
blew up a statue at Haymarket Square commemorating the police officers
allegedly killed by Anarchists in 1886.[^10]

When the day came, only about 150 to 250 people actually showed up.
Confronting a massive police presence, they started breaking windows of
banks and other businesses. Police fired shots, wounding three people.

The Black Panthers’ Fred Hampton denounced the Days of Rage as
irresponsible:

> We believe that the Weatherman action is anarchistic, opportunistic,
> individualistic, it’s chauvanistic, it’s Custeristic. And that’s the
> bad part about it. It’s Custeristic in that its leaders take people
> into situations where the people can be massacred. And they call it
> revolution, and it’s nothing but child’s play, it’s folly. We think
> these people may be sincere but they’re misguided. They’re muddleheads
> and they’re scatterbrains.[^11]

The Yippies’ Abbie Hoffman questioned the strategic value of Weather’s
violence, calling it “Gandhian violence for the element of purging guilt
through moral witness.”[^12]

Weatherman found themselves extremely isolated and alone after the Days
of Rage. At this time, they decided to go underground and start calling
themselves the Weather Underground Organization. They also decided to
abandon the above-ground group SDS, since they wanted to focus on
underground activities. Rudd later regretted the decision:

> The destruction of SDS was probably the single greatest mistake I’ve
> made in my life (and I’ve made quite a few). It was a historical
> crime. The war was far from over—hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops
> were still in Vietnam, and we had yet to invade Cambodia and Laos. It
> would continue for five more years. We should have tried to use SDS to
> build as broad and powerful a movement to end the war as possible. Yet
> my friends and I chose to scuttle America’s largest radi- cal
> organization—with chapters on hundreds of campuses, a powerful
> national identity, and enormous growth potential—for a fantasy of
> revolutionary urban-guerrilla warfare. None of us in the Weather
> leadership, to my knowledge, were police agents either. We did it all
> ourselves. For decades I’ve been contemplating the wonder of this
> fact.[^13]

# Town House Bombing

In March 1970, a Weatherman collective in New York’s Greenwich Village
was building a bomb that they planned to set off at a dance at Fort Dix,
New Jersey. It would have killed military officers and their dates.
Brian Flanagan explained the rationale, “Our slogan was ‘Bring the war
home’, and we really wanted to give the United States and the rest of
the world a sense that this country was going to be completely unlivable
if the United States continued in Vietnam.” As the collective worked on
the bomb, it exploded and killed three Weathermen. After this tragic
accident, the Weathermen agreed that their future actions would target
only property, not people.[^14]

Ward Churchill argues that it was a mistake for Weather to restrict
their strategy to vandalism and symbolic actions:

> Brian Flanagan and Mark Rudd, who are in this new film about the
> Weathermen, are saying ‘you know, we made a conscious decision to do
> only property actions,’ which was not the original impulse and not the
> original understanding. It was a sort of wounded response to having
> three people killed in the Greenwich townhouse explosion. Well, in
> human terms I understand that these were their friends and all that,
> but if you are actually serious about engaging in an armed struggle
> and plan on testing the capacity of the United States, you have to
> anticipate that you’re going to incur casualties. And three is hardly
> an insurmountable toll that’s been taken. So again, you had middle
> class kids who were posturing as something else, and legitimately
> wanted to be something else and tried to transcend their origins. But
> they couldn’t do it in and of themselves, and they didn’t really have
> an interactive relationship with other movements, organizations, or
> people coming from a different experiential background and temper.
> They were a sort of bourgeois response. So you’re saying you’re going
> to do one thing, but actually you’re unprepared to do it. I can
> understand that, but I don’t accept that as being a model.”[^15]

# Ongoing bombings and Jailbreak of Timothy Leary

In June 1970, the Weather Underground bombed the New York Police
Department headquarters, and later that year they bombed the Capitol,
the California Department of Corrections, and the Pentagon. In
September, they broke LSD-promoting countercultural guru Timothy Leary
out of a minimum security prison.[^16]

Leary, 50 years old, climbed and dropped down a fourteen-foot wall and
ran to a highway, where jailbreakers met him with black hair dye and a
new identification card. Leary was brought to Algeria, where he held a
press release with Eldridge Cleaver. Algeria kicked Leary out of the
country, and he went to Afghanistan, where he was arrested by US agents
in 1973.[^17]

# Dissolution

In 1974, the Weather Underground released a new manifesto titled
*Prairie Fire*. It put a new emphasis on mass organization and building
a Communist party. It attempted to revive the Left at a time when the
Left was in serious decline.

After the US ended the Vietnam War in 1975, the Weather Underground
started disbanding, and its members went into hiding. The 2002
documentary ‘’The Weather Underground’’ recounts, “By the end of the
1970s almost all of the members of the Weather Underground had turned
themselves in. Few ended up going to prison. Ironically, the government
was forced to drop most of the charges against them when it became clear
how much the FBI had broken the law in pursuing the group.”[^18]

Peter Gelderloos comments in *How Nonviolence Protects the State*:

> Interestingly, even among militant white activists, racism encourages
> passivity. One of the problems of the Weather Underground is that they
> were claiming to fight alongside black and Vietnamese people, but this
> was just posturing — they conducted harmless, symbolic bombings and
> disdained actions likely to put their own lives at risk. Today, their
> veterans are not dead or imprisoned (excepting three victims of an
> early explosives making accident and those who left Weather to fight
> alongside members of the Black Liberation Army); they are living
> comfortably as academics and professionals. Militant white anarchists
> in North America today exhibit similar tendencies. Many of the most
> vocal disdain ongoing liberation struggles, denouncing them as “not
> anarchist,” rather than supporting their most anti-authoritarian
> elements. The result is that these hard-core (and, at the same time,
> armchair) anarchists can find no real (and dangerous) resistance
> worthy of their support, so they stick to militant postures and the
> violence of ideological hairsplitting.[^19]
