Between the tenth and thirteenth centuries throughout western Europe,
especially in Italy, merchants, artisans and professionals established
communes with their own autonomous governments. Members of the commune
swore an oath to protect each other's interests and liberties. At public
assemblies, people made decisions and elected administrators. Membership
in the commmune was exclusive to certain skilled male workers, but the
Pavia commune reached 1,000 members and Milan 900 members.[^1] Peter
Kropotkin thought highly of the Medieval commune and devoted to it two
chapters in <a href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution</a>. The anthropologist Harold Barclay criticized Kropotkin's
portrayal, arguing "there is little justification for Kropotkin's
treating it as if it were some worthy example of early anarchy."[^2].

# Culture

Kropotkin describes the effect that participatory society had on the
communes' architecture:

> Mediæval architecture attained its grandeur -- not only because it was
> a natural development of handicraft; not only because each building,
> each architectural decoration, had been devised by men who knew
> through the experience of their own hands what artistic effects can be
> obtained from stone, iron, bronze, or even from simple logs and
> mortar; not only because, each monument was a result of collective
> experience, accumulated in each "mystery" or craft\[238\] -- it was
> grand because it was born out of a grand idea. Like Greek art, it
> sprang out of a conception of brotherhood and unity fostered by the
> city. It had an audacity which could only be won by audacious
> struggles and victories; it had that expression of vigour, because
> vigour permeated all the life of the city. A cathedral or a communal
> house symbolized the grandeur of an organism of which every mason and
> stone-cutter was the builder, and a mediæval building appears -- not
> as a solitary effort to which thousands of slaves would have
> contributed the share assigned them by one man's imagination; all the
> city contributed to it.

# Decisions

At popular assemblies, the earliest communal institution in the Medieval
commune, people passed laws and elected executive and judicial
administrators for a one-year term.[^3] The city was divided into
several sections, each with a degree of autonomy. Kropotkin writes, "The
city was usually divided into four quarters, or into five to seven
sections radiating from a centre, each quarter or section roughly
corresponding to a certain trade or profession which prevailed in it,
but nevertheless containing inhabitants of different social positions
and occupations -- nobles, merchants, artisans, or even half-serfs; and
each section or quarter constituted a quite independent agglomeration.
In Venice, each island was an independent political community."[^4]

The Pavia commune reached 1,000 participating members and Milan reached
900 participating members. Still, the communes "excluded the unskilled,
the poor, field workers, and most immigrants" and women.[^5]

# Economy

Within the commune, workers joined guilds based on their trade.
Kropotkin describes the practices of a Danish guild to illustrate the
spirit of comradery the guilds exemplified:

> If a brother's house is burned, or he has lost his ship, or has
> suffered on a pilgrim's voyage, all the brethren must come to his aid.
> If a brother falls dangerously ill, two brethren must keep watch by
> his bed till he is out of danger, and if he dies, the brethren must
> bury him -- a great affair in those times of pestilences -- and follow
> him to the church and the grave. After his death they must provide for
> his children, if necessary; very often the widow becomes a sister to
> the guild.

The anthropologist Harold Barclay points out a hierarchical nature in
the guilds:

> Kropotkin overlooks the class oriented and exploitive nature of the
> European guild system. Ostensibly one might say members of a guild
> gradually progressed from one status to a higher and more responsible
> one - that the ultimate aim of guild membership was graduation to the
> rank of master. This then is no different from the ideal of any
> rational educational system in which the student has the potentiality
> of becoming equal in knowledge to his or her teacher. However that
> might be, in the guild system, masters were the rulers and indeed
> dictators. The apprentices at the bottom were treated hardly better
> than common slaves. They had to be especially submissive and obedient
> if they wanted to advance to a higher rank of journeyman, since that
> depended upon the say of the masters. All power in the guild was
> vested in the masters and the majority of members could only act as
> 'yes men' to them.

Communes in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Italy and Russia used to
purchase goods at bulk and distribute them to all citizens at cost
price.[^6] Later on, when the communal purchase of goods was abandoned,
communes ensured that citizens received a sufficient amount of food.
When food arrived, it went immediately to a market where anyone could
purchase it before the remainder was sold to retailers. Kropotkin
writes, "In short, if a scarcity visited the city, all had to suffer
from it more or less; but apart from the calamities, so long as the free
cities existed no one could die in their midst from starvation, as is
unhappily too often the case in our own times."[^7]

Kropotkin argues that science had advanced by the fifteenth century that
the Industrial Revolution necessarily had to result. He speculates
without capitalists' primitive accumulation, Europe could have
industrialized under the jurisdiction of the participatory Medieval
communes.[^8]

# Environment

# Crime

Sarah Blanshei has studied the legal systems in the medieval communes
Perugia and Bologna. In the first half of the thirteenth century,
Bologna imposed a fine as a punishment for homicide and mandated that
the perpetrator seek a peace agreement from the victim's family. Perugia
also imposed a fine for homicide and by 1266 mandated the expulsion of
perpetrators for a minimum of five years. Penalties became more severe
over time. By the end of the century, the communes mandated the death
penalty for certain types of homicide, including hiring assassins,
parricide, and killing someone in their own home.[^9]

# Revolution

In Ghent and Ypres, cloth weaves and fullers organized into "lesser
guilds" and "waged a veritable class war against their patrician
exploiters and ultimately triumphed over them, establishing a civic
structure that gave consideravble rights both to themselves and to 'low
degree' guildsmen-and excluding most patricians."[^10]

Federations of communes and villages continually waged war against the
feudal lords in Italy. Kropotkin writes, "The burghers sent out
emissaries to lead revolt in the villages; they received villages into
their corporations, and they waged direct war against the nobles."[^11]

# Neighboring Societies

In addition to the anti-feudal confederations mentioned in the last
section, communes formed confederations for the peaceful purposes of
regulating wine production, commerce and navigation.

Kropotkin argues that the communes declined for of two reasons. First,
their economy over-emphasized commerce and industry, to the neglect of
agriculture. Second, the commune members became increasingly won over by
the Statist teachings of the Church, universities, and law courts.[^12]

> *conjuratio*, to respect one another’s individual liberties and to

> effect, an expression of citizenship in a distinct civic community.
>

> (but not the weavers and labourers)—confronted the aristocracy with
> demands that communal political life be expanded to include their

> Pavia’s council expanded from 150 to 1,000 members in the same years,
> and Milan’s grew from 400 to 900, while at Montpellier the guild
