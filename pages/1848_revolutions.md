In 1848, revolution broke out in fifty countries around the world, and
although revolutionaries did not succeed in holding onto state power,
their efforts transformed political common sense. Over subsequent
decades, political radicalism became a widely-known force and radical
policies such as universal primary education became implemented almost
everywhere.[^1] According to *Wikipedia*, “Significant lasting reforms
included the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary, the end of
absolute monarchy in Denmark, and the introduction of parliamentary
democracy in the Netherlands.”[^2]

Kropotkin later commented on how the revolution spread across national
borders: “No sooner had it broken out in Rome than it spread to France,
to Vienna, to Berlin.”[^3] The revolutions spread to parts of Latin
America, with uprisings in New Granana and Brazil.[^4] World-systems
analyst Immanuel Wallerstein refers to the “world revolution” of
1848.[^5]

One lesson that many radicals learned from the revolutions was the need
to organize independently from bourgeois democrats. Initially, Marx and
Engels urged radicals to subordinate themselves to bourgeois parties,
and they joined Germany's Democratic Association of Cologne which
adopted such a strategy. However, they questioned this approach upon
seeing such developments as the Frankfurt Assembly capitulating to
monarchists and Prussian troops repressing workers and peasants. In
April 1849, Marx resigned from the Democratic Association, and in his
1850 Address to the Commmunist League he advocated that workers organize
independently toward a "<a href="Permanent_revolution" class="wikilink"
title="revolution in permanence">revolution in permanence</a>" that
seeks full social liberation.[^6]

# Paris

Food shortages, economic crisis, soaring unemployment, and years of
socialist agitation sparked unrest in Paris by February 1848. Workers
criticized the government at public banquets and organized into reform
clubs and secret societies. Rebellious members of the National Guard
planned a banquet with an admission price low enough that working-class
masses could attend and use the occasion to denounce the monarchy. The
state intervened, installing a conservative committee to plan and co-opt
the banquet. This new committee raised the admission price and
rescheduled the picnic from a Sunday to a weekday. The day before the
planned event, the government banned it and all public meetings in
Paris.[^7]

On 22 February, the day after the banquet’s cancellation, Parisian
workers went on strike and students protested. Parisians set up
barricades. The following day, the president Francois Guizot stepped
down. As a crowd gathered to celebrate the president’s dismissal that
night, the National Guard opened fire and killed 52 people. Increasing
numbers of guards discarded their posts and joined the rebels. They
replaced cries of “Long live the king” with “Long live reform.” By the
end of the 24th, the king Louis-Philippe fled to England.[^8]

On the 24th, the King abdicated. Rebels entered the Parliament chamber
and declared a Provisional Government with two Socialist secretaries,
Louis Blanc and Albert.[^9]

On the 25th, Alexis de Toqueville spent the day in Paris and saw no
authority figures: no police, no soldiers, no Guardsmen. “Throughout the
whole day in Paris I never saw one of the former agents of authority:
not a soldier, not a gendarme, nor a policeman; even the National Guard
had vanished. The people alone bore arms, guarded public buildings,
watched, commanded and punished; it was an extraordinary and terrible
thing to see the whole of this huge city in the hands of those who owned
nothing.”[^10]

On the 26th, the government repealed restrictions on assembly, and
throughout the Paris area 100,000 people joined over 200 political
clubs.[^11] The provisional government reduced the work day by one and a
half hours, and they implemented national workshops that gave jobs to
the unemployed. However, hastily held elections in April, giving
radicals scarce time to campaign, put a conservative government in
charge which sacked the two socialist secretaries and put an end to
various social programs. On 21 June, they got rid of the national
workshops.[^12]

From 23 to 26 June, radical workers once again took up arms and demanded
a “democratic and social republic” that would complete the revolution
betrayed by the provisional government. About 40,000 insurgents took
part, including women who in some cases fought along the men in the
barricades. The provisional government sent out all the firepower it had
to brutally crush the uprising. The moderate republicans killed an
estimated 400 to 500 radical revolutionaries and arrested 12,000.[^13]

Not long after the massacre, Napoleon’s nephew Louis Bonaparte ran for
president of France and won. At his term’s end, in 1851, he launched a
coup, and the next year he declared himself emperor, bringing an end to
France’s brief period of universal manhood suffrage.[^14] Some moderate
rebels such as Victor Hugo, who had just overseen the June 1848
massacre, urged workers to rise up against Napoleon III and defend the
revolution. The masses “turned him a deaf ear,” Crimethinc summarizes:
“Why should they risk their lives to preserve the authority of the
Republicans who had massacred them last time they rose against their
oppressors?”[^15]

Anarchist economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon fought behind the barricades,
printed one of the revolution's first posters, and wrote revolutionary
pamphlets. He called for "a revolution from below, from true democracy."
One June 4th, he was elected to the National Assembly and in 1849 he
helped establish a briefly-lived Bank of the People. In retaliation for
public criticism, Bonaparte imprisoned Proudhon for three years
beginning June 1849.[^16]
