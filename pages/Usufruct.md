**Usufruct** is a limited real right found in civil law and mixed
jurisdictions that unites the two property interests of *usus* and
*fructus*:

- *Usus* (use, as in usage of or access to) is the right to use or enjoy
  a thing possessed, directly and without altering it.
- *Fructus* (fruit, as in the fruits of production) is the right to
  derive profit from a thing possessed: for instance, by selling crops,
  leasing immovables or annexed movables, taxing for entry, and so on.

A usufruct is either granted in severalty or held in common ownership,
as long as the property is not damaged or destroyed. The third civilian
property interest is *abusus* (literally abuse), the right to alienate
the thing possessed, either by consuming or destroying it (e.g., for
profit), or by transferring it to someone else (e.g., sale, exchange,
gift). Someone enjoying all three rights has full ownership.

Generally, a usufruct is a system in which a person or group of persons
uses the real property (often land) of another. The "usufructuary" does
not own the property, but does have a legally cognizable interest in it,
which is sanctioned or contractually granted by the owner. Two different
types of usufruct exist: perfect and imperfect. In perfect usufruct, the
usufructuary is entitled to the use of the property but cannot
substantially change it. For example, an owner of a house can grant a
usufruct to a resident; the resident could live in (use) the house, but
could not (without the owner's assent) renovate it or tear it down and
build a bigger house.[^1]

An imperfect usufruct gives the usufructuary some rights to modify the
property. For example, if a land owner grants a piece of land to a
usufructuary for agriculture, the usufructuary may be given the right to
make improvements for agricultural purposes such as building a barn or
laying irrigation pipes. This, however, may be ill-advised for the
usufructuary inasmuch as they do not own whatever improvements they make
and have no claim against the owner for their value, unless this is
specifically laid out in the contract creating the usufruct.[^2][^3]

In many cases of tenure by usufruct, such as the *ejido* system in
Mexico, individuals or groups may only acquire the usufruct of the
property, not legal ownership.[^4] Usufructs are similar in nature to
common-law life estates, save that a usufruct can be granted for a
specified term rather than for life.

## History

Usufruct comes from civil law, under which it is a subordinate real
right (*ius in re aliena*) of specified duration, usually for a person's
lifetime. The holder of a usufruct, known as the usufructuary, has the
right to use (*usus*) the property and enjoy its fruits (*fructus*). In
modern terms, *fructus* more or less corresponds to the profit derived,
as when selling the "fruits" (in both literal and figurative senses) of
the land, or leasing homes on the land to tenants.

*Fruits* refers to any renewable commodity on the property, including
(among others) agricultural goods (literal "fruits", hence the name),
livestock, goods produced in a factory, or rents from tenants. These may
be divided into civil (*fructus civiles*), industrial (*fructus
industriales*), and natural fruits (*fructus naturales*), the latter of
which, in Roman law, included slaves and livestock.

Under Roman law, usufruct was a type of personal servitude (*servitutes
personarum*), a beneficial right in another's property. The usufructuary
never had possession (in the legal sense) of the property (on the basis
that if he possessed at all, he did so through the owner), but did have
an interest in the property itself for the specified period (either a
set term or a lifetime). Unlike the owner, the usufructuary did not have
a right of alienation (*abusus*), but could sell or lease the
usufructuary interest. Even though the usufructary did not hold
possessory title, he had a cause of action against infringements on his
usufruct rights by a third party, such as theft of goods from the
property.

In some now-disused systems of customary law among the indigenous
peoples of the Americas, usufruct refers to the legal concept that all
land is publicly owned, but individuals and groups can acquire the right
to use certain areas, usually for agriculture. Some cultures held this
to be similar in concept to a perfect usufruct; one could not damage the
land so as to reduce its future productivity. Ancient examples of
usufruct are found in the Code of Hammurabi and the Law of Moses. The
Law of Moses forbade landowners from harvesting the edges of their
fields, and reserved the gleanings for the poor.[^5]

## In social ecology

Usufruct is a central concept in
"<a   href="social_ecology.md" class="wikilink" title="social ecology">"social
ecology</a>. "<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">"Murray Bookchin</a> defines usufruct informally
as "The freedom of individuals in a community to appropriate resources
merely by virtue of the fact that they are using them".[^6]

Bookchin contrasts Usufruct with other property relations, saying:
"Usufruct, in short, differs qualitatively from the quid pro quo of
reciprocity, exchange, and mutual aid — all of which are trapped within
history's demeaning account books with their 'just' ratios and their
'honest' balance sheets."[^7]

He pairs the concept of usufruct with complementarity and the
irreducible minimum as core to his ethical world view: "What
'civilization' has given us, in spite of itself, is the recognition that
the ancient values of usufruct, complementarity, and the irreducible
minimum must be extended from the kin group to humanity as a whole."[^8]
