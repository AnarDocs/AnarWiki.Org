The Earth is a self-regulating system according to Earth system science
and its more radical predecessor known as the Gaia hypothesis. The
planet's biological, physical, and chemical components cooperate to
stabilize the Earth's temperature, acidity, salinity, and atmosphere.
Thus, the Earth does not function as a hierarchy or as merely a
competitive struggle between all beings. Rather, members of a highly
decentralized global network often cooperate to ensure mutual survival
over billions of years.

# History of Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science

James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis first advanced the Gaia hypothesis,
jointly publishing in the 1970s in outlets including the journal
*Icarus* edited by Carl Sagan and in *Tellus*. They drew harsh criticism
from reductionist scientists such as Richard Dawkins who asserted that
the Earth cannot self-regulate since it does not have the consciousness
necessary to plan and have foresight. In 1983, Lovelock responded by
programming a computer simulation called Daisyworld. In Daisyworld,
sunlight-reflecting white daisies and sunlight-absorbing black daisies
cooperated to stabilize the planet's temperature, allowing life to
thrive for an extended period of time. The model demonstrated that
planetary self-regulation does not require foresight or conscious
planning.[^1]

The biochemist Stephen Harding claims that such models have advanced the
Gaia hypothesis into a Gaia theory. Harding has programmed more complex
and realistic computer models of Daisyworld involving many types of
plants, herbivores, and carnivores. This work further demonstrated the
ability of the Earth to self-regulate. [^2]

Meanwhile, in the 1980s scientists at NASA and the International
Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) were studying the Earth as a system
composed of interlocking chemical, biological, and climactic
processes.[^3]

Today, Earth system science is a mainstream body of science. It draws
heavily on Gaian ideas but, in an effort to fit into dominant scientific
culture, removes the reference to the Greek earth goddess Gaia. In
Amsterdam in 2001, over a thousand delegates signed a statement, “The
Earth System behaves as a single, self-regulating system comprised of
physical, chemical, biological and human components.”[^4] Science writer
Ferris Jabr observes that the "essence" of the Gaia hypothesis has
entered "mainstream science." In particular, it is now widely understood
that "life transforms and in many cases regulates the planet."[^5]

# Examples of Self-Regulation

"<a   href="File:Gaia_evidence.png.md" class="wikilink"
title="framed">"framed</a>

Harding's book *Animate Earth* presents the charts above as evidence of
the Earth's ability to self-regulate. The figure on the left shows that
the the Earth has kept its conditions habitable for life for its 4.6
billion years of existence, despite the sun sending progressively more
heat to the Earth. The middle chart shows that, until very recently
impacted by extreme human impacts, the Earth kept its atmospheric levels
of carbon dioxide within the stable range of 180 and 300 parts per
million. The chart on the right shows that the Earth has consistently
recovered even from mass extinction events, taking 5 to 10 million years
each time. To Harding, this resilience "is strong evidence for
Gaia."[^6]

Harding warns, however, that humans have largely impaired Gaia by taking
over half of the planet's surface and by causing unprecedented rates of
destruction. Thus, there is no guarantee that Gaia will survive this
time around: “the fact that biodiversity has recovered after previous
mass extinctions is no guarantee that the same thing will happen again.
After all, Gaia is now older and more stressed by the sun, and the
current mass extinction is happening much more quickly than any
other.”[^7]

The nitrogen cycle is another example of self-regulation. Nitrogen is a
key nutrient for life, but it isn't accessible until certain bacteria
"fix" the air's nitrogen by bringing it into the soils and bodies of
water. In a nitrogen-deficient ecosystem, bacteria that fixes its own
nitrogen has a clear advantage over nonfixers, and the number of fixers
will increase and enhances the ecosystem. Once there is abundant
available nitrogen (it is toxic to an ecosystem in excess), the fixers
lose their advantage over nonfixers. Thus, as Timonthy Lenton writes,
"Reduced nitrogen input will lead to more nitrogen fixation; increased
nirogen input, to less nitrogen fixation." This process has been
observed in pastures and lakes and is theorized to be key to how the
world's oceans maintain nutrient balance.[^8]

Another example involves the Amazon rainforest's summoning of rain. Jabr
explains:

> Life in the Amazon does not simply receive rain — it summons it. All
> of that lush vegetation releases 20 billion tons of water vapor into
> the sky every day. Trees saturate the air with gaseous compounds and
> salts. Fungi exhale plumes of spores. The wind sweeps bacteria,
> pollen, leaf fragments and bits of insect shells into the atmosphere.
> The wet breath of the forest, peppered with microbes and organic
> residues, creates ideal conditions for rain. With so much water in the
> air and so many minute particles on which the water can condense, rain
> clouds quickly form.[^9]

# Archean

With each eon lasting a thousand million years, the Archean is the era
from Earth's assembly 4.5 eons ago to the oxygen revolution 2.5 eons
ago. Gaia theory suggests that life during the Archean adapted the Earth
to make it a home. There emerged a self-regulating interaction between
early photosynthesizers (cyanoacteria) who *cooled* the Earth by
removing heat-trapping carbon-dioxide from the atmosphere and methanogen
decomposers who *warmed* the Earth by converting
"<a   href="bacteria.md" class="wikilink" title="bacteria">"bacteria</a> into
the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane.[^10] So, the
photosynthesizers were like the light daisies of the Daisyworld model,
and the decomposers were like the dark daisies. Together, they kept the
planet at livable temperatures.[^11]

# Proterozoic

Around 2.5 eons ago, photosynthesizers transformed the atmosphere from
being methane-dominated to being oxygen-dominated. This transformation
heralded a new geological era, the Proterozoic. This period saw the
"<a   href="Evolution_of_eukaryotes.md" class="wikilink"
title="evolution of eukaryotes">"evolution of eukaryotes</a>, when two
cells symbiotically combined to form a more complex cell with a nucleus
surrounded by a membrane. The new type of cell, the eukaryote, went on
to become the building block of plants, animals, and fungi.

A key self-regulatory mechanism of the Proterozoic involved the deposit
of calcium carbonate on the oceanic floor. Through such deposits,
bacteria converted toxic soluble calcium into insoluble calcium.
Although calcium is essential for many life forms, too much of it is
deadly, and this self-regulatory mechanism would have been crucial for
many beings' survival.[^12]

Another example of self-regulation involved salt-regulation. Few
organisms can survive with an abundance of salt, and oceans stayed
within a safe salinity level. Various chemical reactions helped remove
salt from the sea floor, and microorganisms deposited salt as sediments
and as limestone.[^13]

# Phanerozoic

Lasting from 600 million years ago until today, the Phanerozoic marks
the time when organisms evolved to be large enough that they could be
seen with a human's naked eye.[^14] During this period, the carbon cycle
marked one example of planetary self-regulation, in which the vegetation
sequestered carbon and produced oxygen, keeping atmospheric carbon
dioxide within levels manageable for most life on Earth. This process
has, of course, been disrupted by the capitalist system's unprecedented
levels of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions.

# Resistance

Raoul Vaneigem, formerly a theorist of the
"<a   href="Situationist_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationist International">"Situationist International</a>,
argues that the Earth engages in resistance to the grow-or-die,
destructive capitalist system:

> \[N\]ature has unpredictable fits of anger, sudden jolts that threaten
> the edifice of civilization. And the moment it refuses to pro­duce,
> nature, like workers in revolt, is deemed stupid, pit­iless and
> cruel.[^15]

Many anti-authoritarian societies, communities, and movements have
sought to live in harmony with and act in defense of the Earth. For

First!</a> and "<a   href="Earth_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
