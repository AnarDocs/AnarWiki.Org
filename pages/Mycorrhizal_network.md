In forests, trees' roots connect underground to each other with the
facilitation of vast networks of fungi that facilitate *mycorrhiza*, or
tree-fungi symbiosis. Trees use the networks to share nutrients and
information with each other. The fungi benefit by taking some of the
carbon-rich sugars the trees generate in photosynthesis. *New York
Times* science journalist Ferris Jabr comments that the process displays
an "interspecies selflessness of trees, however — a practice that verges
on socialism."[^1]

The existence of mycorrhizal networks confirms the traditional knowledge
of indigenous peoples according to the forest ecologist Sm’hayetsk
Teresa Ryan, of Tsimshian heritage, "There are many aboriginal groups
that will tell you stories about how all the species in the forests are
connected, and many will talk about below-ground networks.”

Although trees recognize their kin and are especially cooperative with
relatives, they also share with members of other species. In North
America, tall birch trees send carbon to shaded fir trees in the summer,
and fir trees send carbon to the birch trees in the winter. Forest
ecologist Suzane Simard remarks, “So it turns out the two species were
interdependent, like yin and yang.”[^2]

"Survival of the fittest" does not apply to trees in the forests. Strong
trees need the weaker trees to survive in order to keep the hot sun and
rough winds from ruining the cool, moist forest floor.[^3]

Many plants rely extensively on the mycorrhizal networks. All orchids,
for example, spend at least some of their youth taking from the network
without giving anything back. About ten percent of plant species behave
this way their whole lives.[^4]
