Anarchists have defended themselves successfully throughout history and
are doing so in some areas still today, most notably the

<a href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a>, including
being instrumental in defining ISIS.

lasted for at least two thousand years presumably they defended
themselves against more aggressive groups during that time.

The Spanish anarchists provide a compelling example, as they
successfully defended themselves against fascist forces during the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> (1936-1939). Workers'
militias, organized horizontally with democratically elected delegates
rather than traditional officers, held off Franco's better-equipped
forces for years until they were betrayed.

The Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, known as the Makhnovists
(1918-1921), demonstrated that anarchist defense could succeed even
against overwhelming odds. Despite being vastly outnumbered and armed
primarily with weapons captured from enemies, these volunteer militias
defended southern Ukraine against German and Austrian occupation, the
White Army, Ukrainian nationalists, and eventually the Bolshevik Red
Army. Their extraordinary mobility and guerrilla tactics allowed them to
defeat larger, better-equipped forces, and they played a crucial role in
crushing General Denikin's White Army. The Makhnovists maintained
anarchist principles throughout, with elected and recallable commanders,
voluntary enlistment, and a commitment to encouraging liberated
communities to organize themselves freely rather than imposing
authority.

The effectiveness of anarchist defense lies not in military technology
or command hierarchies, but in popular support and the motivation of
people fighting for their own freedom. When defenders believe they are
protecting their own revolution rather than serving distant authorities,
they fight with far greater determination and creativity. Decentralized
organization proves advantageous in defensive warfare, allowing rapid
adaptation to changing conditions, intimate knowledge of local terrain,
and resilience against the capture or elimination of individual leaders.
As one theorist noted, hierarchical societies often fall quickly when
their capital or leader is captured, while anarchist societies with
power distributed throughout the population prove far more difficult to
defeat.
