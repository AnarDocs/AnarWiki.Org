In Rwanda since 2012, groups of young gorillas have been seen
intentionally dismantling traps that hunters set. Hunters had attached
nooses to bent bamboo branches. Eben Diskin reports:

> Gorillas, however, are taking a proactive approach to these traps. A
> research team in Rwanda recently found groups of young gorillas
> actively seeking out and dismantling traps, to prevent their brethren
> from falling victim. The research team observed one gorilla bending
> and breaking the tree, while another disabled the noose, repeating the
> process for multiple traps. The team believes that gorillas have
> witnessed a correlation between these devices and the deaths of their
> peers, prompting their desire to neutralize them.[^1]
