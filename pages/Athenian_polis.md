From the 5th to the 4th century BCE, Athens's male citizen population of
40,000 people, about a fifth of the total population, practiced direct,
participatory self-governance. At a general assembly known as the
ecclesia, which met at least 40 times a year, citizens used majority
voting to decide on public policy. Athenians referred to their city as a
*polis*, meaning a political community.

On the cusp of a possible revolt against the ruling aristocratic class,
Athens in 594 BCE appointed Solon as chief magistrate to maintain peace.
Solon's reforms laid the basic groundwork for Athenian democracy. While
maintaining a significant role for the aristocratic Areopagus council,
Solon revived the ecclesia and granted ordinary citizens the right to
participate in it. Starting in 506, the chief magistrate Cleisthenes
initiated direct democracy in Athens, establishing local units called
demes to take over much of the local governance that family clans had
been controlling. Later reformers stripped the Areopagus council of its
remaining commanding powers.[^1]

Athenian democracy involved a highly exclusionary conception of the
polis, and thinkers have long debated the centrality of this exclusivity
to the citizenry's democratic governance. While some anarchists such as
Murray Bookchin argued that such exclusivity was harmful or
contradictory to direct democracy, the Crimethinc Ex-Workers Collective
asserts that exclusion and exploitation are *intrinsic* features of
democracy as opposed to genuine anarchy:

"In ancient Athens, the much-touted 'birthplace of democracy,' we
already see the exclusion and coercion that have been essential features
of democratic government ever since. Only adult male citizens with
military training could vote; women, slaves, debtors, and all who lacked
Athenian blood were excluded. At the very most, democracy involved less
than a fifth of the population.

Indeed, slavery was more prevalent in ancient Athens than in other Greek
city states, and women had fewer rights relative to men. Greater
equality among male citizens apparently meant greater solidarity against
women and foreigners. The space of participatory politics was a gated
community."[^2]

# Culture

According to Wikipedia, 5th-century Athens "produced some of the most
influential and enduring cultural artifacts of the Western tradition.
The playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides all lived and worked
in 5th century BCE Athens, as did the historians Herodotus and
Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher
Socrates."[^3]

Athenian culture emphasized the theme of citizenship, meaning active
participating in a political community. *Paideia*, normally translated
as education, taught residents civic duty, critical thinking, and
virtuous living.[^4]

Freedom did not extend to women, slaves, and non-citizens. Athens was
extremely patriarchal, and women "were expected to wear veils when they
ventured out in public."[^5] The Crimethinc Ex-Workers Collective points
out:

Four fifths of the population--women, slaves and foreign residents--were
excluded from government. Still, a population of 40,000 Athenian male
citizens practiced direct democracy at the local and citywide levels.
This section describes Athenian democracy in the fifth century BCE,
after Cleisthenes's reforms.

Athenian assemblies used majoritarian decision-making, although
political scientist David Helds notes that "the ideal remained
consensus, and it is not clear that even a majority of issues was put to
the vote."[^7] Athens may have been the birthplace of formal
majoritarian voting.

Anthropologist David Graeber, a proponent of modified consensus
decision-making, speculates that majoritarian voting emerged from the
fact that the citizens of Athens were armed. Majority voting, according
to Graeber's theory, became a proxy for what would happen if the
population actually fought over a given issue: "Every vote was, in a
real sense, a conquest."[^8]

## Demes

Cleisthenes divided Athens into over 100 administrative areas known as
*demes*. Each deme made decisions at a general assembly presided over by
an elected mayor. The demes elected officials and priests, managed
parish lands, maintained shrines, organized festivals, and enacted
taxes. A citizen could participate in his deme starting at the age of
18. Membership in demes were hereditary, meaning that a person living
away from his deme was disenfranchised. [^9]

## Ecclesia

The ecclesia, a city-wide general assembly that at its height met at
least forty times a year, was the city's legislative body. Any citizen
over the age of 20 could attend, vote and speak. For ordinary decisions,
there was no quorum. A decree that uniquely affected a single individual
required 6,000 people to be present. Banishing someone required a
6,000-person majority. Average attendance was probably below 5,000. The
only recorded vote shows 3,461 voting yes and 155 voting no. The Council
of Five Hundred, composed of people selected by lot to serve one-year
terms, created an agenda for each ecclesia meeting and circulated it
along with the meeting announcement. Alfred Zimmern describes the
atmosphere on Pnyx Hill before the start of the assembly:

> The Athenian assembly came together in the open air, and yet not, for
> all that, under conditions of physical discomfort: for the orators of
> Athens did not compel their victims, like our park and street-corner
> gatherings to listen standing up. The Athenians came to their popular
> assembly unlike the Romans, in order to think, not to gape; and no man
> (except for a Socrates) can think hard standing upright for hours. On
> an assembly morning citizens would come together soon after sunrise,
> having left their beds in the country, or in Salamis across the water,
> long before it was light enough to see their way into their cloak and
> shoes. Once safely on Pnyx Hill they would dispose themselves as they
> liked among friends and acquaintances; for Demos in Council knew of no
> tribes or thirds or any subdivisions of his sovereignty. There they
> would sit grumbling and yawning and scratching their heads, going over
> their olive-trees or composing letters to absent friends, wishing they
> had stopped for a mixed drink on their way up, above all lamenting the
> square meal they will not get till tomorrow (for it will be too late
> when they get home to have a supper worth eating), till the lazy
> townfolk stroll up from Athens and the Piraeus and, last of all, the
> unpunctual councilors come bustling through the crowd. Then, at last,
> when our countryman has not a curse left in his quiver, prayers are
> announced, and the proceedings begin." [^10]

## Council of Five Hundred

The Council of Five Hundred handled administrative tasks, including
finance and foreign affairs. Notably, the council created the agenda for
each ecclesia meeting. Members were drawn by lot from the set of
candidates elected by the demes. Members served for only one year, and a
citizen could not serve more than twice. The council was divided into
ten committees, each of which was on duty for one tenth of the
year.[^11]

## Areopagus and Archons

Athens' democratic features existed alongside an *areopagus* council,
which the assembly elected from among the aristocracy, and magistrates
known as *archons*. In 487 BCE, election by lot was introduced for the
archons. In 461 BCE, the areopagus council's powers were transferred to
the ecclesia, the Council of Five Hundred, and the jury courts. [^12]

# Economy

Although the city placed few restrictions on Athenians' private property
and avoided taxation when possible, citizens were expected to generously
contribute funds for public works. Zimmern explains the attitude toward
taxes, "To talk of taxes in such an atmosphere is a blunder as well as a
sacrilege, for a tax is a payment which leaves a man poorer: a 'liturgy'
leaves him richer. He still possesses what he has given, and yet added
to the common store." Zimmern argues socialism would not have worked for
the Athenians: "It was not that they objected to working in a State
system: it was that they objected to working in any system whatsoever.
It was their settled inclination and proudest boasts to remain
amateurs". [^13]

Takis Fotopoulos, in contrast, argues that Athenian direct democracy
collapsed precisely because of Athenians' failure to combine it with a
system approaching libertarian socialism. Slavery allowed some citizens
to get significantly richer than other citizens, and it was the
wealthier class that had more time to spend on issues of governance. By
freeing the slaves and expropriating the rich, Fotopoulos argues, Athens
could have relied on internal rather than external sources of revenue to
meet its citizens needs. Instead, Athens' reliance on external revenues
meant that the city's military decline, beginning with its defeat in the
Peloponnesian War, led to an economic decline as well.

> In other words, given that Athens was no longer in a position to
> impose any more external taxes which would finance its internal
> economic democracy, the precondition for the continuation of political
> democracy was its universalization so as to include all the city
> residents (free citizens, women, slaves) and the further development
> of economic democracy. This democracy would not be based, as before,
> on the external financing of the huge public expenditures, but on the
> drastic reduction of the economic inequality amongst residents,
> through the heavier taxing of the higher strata and the parallel
> abolition of slavery which functioned as a disincentive for productive
> work.[^14]

C.L.R. James also argues that slavery was ultimately harmful to Athenian
democracy:

> There are many people today and some of them radicals and
> revolutionaries who sneer at the fact that this democracy was based on
> slavery. So it was, though we have found that those who are prone to
> attack Greek Democracy on behalf of slavery are not so much interested
> in defending the slaves as they are in attacking the democracy.
> Frederick Engels in his book on the family makes an analysis of
> slavery in relation to Greek Democracy and modern scholars on the
> whole agree with him. In the early days, Greek slavery did not occupy
> a very prominent place in the social life and economy of Greece. The
> slave was for the most part a household slave. Later, the slaves grew
> in number until they were at least as many as the number of citizens.
>
> In later years, slavery developed to such a degree, with the
> development of commerce, industry, etc., that it degraded free labor.
> And it is to this extraordinary growth of slavery and the consequent
> degradation of free labor that Engels attributes the decline of the
> great Greek Democracy.[^15]

# Environment

The historian Clive Pointing argues that by the 5th century Athens
already faced severe soil erosion and deforestation due to overgrazing:
"Although the Greeks were well aware of techniques for preserving soil
such as manuring to maintain the structure of the soil and terracing to
limit the erosion on hillsides, the pressure from a continually rising
population proved too great. The hills of Attica were stripped bare of
trees within a couple of generations and by 590 in Athens the great
reformer of the constitution, Solon, was arguing that cultivation on
steep slopes should be banned because of the amount of soil being
lost."[^16]

Bookchin points out that the Greeks' philosophy tended to foster a fear
of wild nature and a desire to systematically domesticate the wild.[^17]

Perhaps Athens's ecological legacy was not all negative, however.
Bookchin comments, "Even the ancient Greeks, heirs to a thin,
mountainous forest soil that suffered heavily from erosion, shrewdly
reclaimed much of their arable land by turning to orchardry and
viticulture."[^18] In perhaps the first essay systematically combining
modern ecology with anarchism, Bookchin advocated a decentralized,
face-to-face politics modelled on the Athenian polis, "partly to solve
our pollution and transportation problems, partly also to create real
communities".[^19]

# Crime

Each year, the demes elected a total of 6,000 jurors to serve in the
central court system. Each morning, the jurors would present themselves
at Theseus's temple and see if they were chosen by lot to serve that
day. Each court had a minimum of 201 jurors, in order to prevent
corruption.

Bookchin argues that because the jurors were not a permanent,
professional class, "the ‘state’ as we know it in modern times could
hardly be said to exist among the Greeks”. Bookchin defines the state as
a professional apparatus of bureaucratic control.[^20] Bob Black,
asserting that Athens did have a state, mocks Bookchin, "Just ask
Socrates. What’ll you be having? Hemlock, straight up." This remark
referenced the infamous 399 BCE trial sentencing Socrates to death by
ingestion of the poisonous plant, as a penalty for impiety and
corrupting the youth.[^21]

# Neighbouring Societies

Athens had a conscript army, with ten elected generals called
*strategos*. The city headed a small empire, which fought and lost to
the Spartans in the 431-404 Peloponnesian War. The Spartans installed
the oligarchical Thirty Tyrants over Athens, although Athenians removed
the tyrants in a 403 battle at Piraeus and began restoring its
democracy. In 338, Macadeonia's King Phillip defeated Athens in the
Battle of Chaeoronea, effectively subjecting Athens to Macedonian
control. In 322, Macedonian general Antipater suppressed Athenian
democracy and imposed oligarchical government on the city.[^22]
