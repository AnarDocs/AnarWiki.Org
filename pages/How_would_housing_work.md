## General Idea

Anarchists, and other Libertarian Socialists tend to believe that
<a href="housing" class="wikilink" title="housing">housing</a> is a
right of all people. We aim to give people high-quality housing either
for free or at an extremely low cost and if we succeed, we will
eliminate high <a href="Rent" class="wikilink" title="rents">rents</a>,
<a href="homelessness" class="wikilink"
title="homelessness">homelessness</a> and low-quality housing (with
infestations of
<a href="Animal" class="wikilink" title="animals">animals</a> and things
that aren’t maintained properly, which can lead to
<a href="Health" class="wikilink" title="health problems">health
problems</a>, <a href="Disasters" class="wikilink"
title="structural collapse and fires">structural collapse and fires</a>).
Not only this, but we desire *tenant’s control* (or *tenant’s democrac*y
or *tenant’s self-management*) in the same way
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="we demand it for workers">we demand it for workers</a>. Tenants
can control their housing in the same way workers would in our society,
through <a href="Democratic_Assembly" class="wikilink"
title="democratic assemblies">democratic assemblies</a> or by electing
their landlord.

## Historical Examples

### Housing Cooperatives

Research from Toronto,
<a href="Canada" class="wikilink" title="Canada">Canada</a> found that
housing cooperatives had residents rate themselves as having the highest
quality of life and housing satisfaction of any housing organisation in
the city.[^1] Other research among older residents from rural
<a href="United_States_of_America" class="wikilink" title="USA">USA</a>
found that those living in housing cooperatives felt much safer,
independent, satisfied with life, had more friends, had more privacy,
were healthier and had things repaired faster.[^2]

<a href="Australia" class="wikilink" title="Australian">Australian</a>
researchers found that cooperative housing built stronger
<a href="Social_Network" class="wikilink" title="social networks">social
networks</a> and support, as well as better relationships with
neighbours compared to other forms of housing. They cost 14% less for
residents and had lower rates of debt and vacancy. Other research has
found that housing cooperatives tended to have higher rates of building
quality, building safety, feelings of security among residents, lower
<a href="crime" class="wikilink" title="crime">crime</a> rates, stable
access to housing and significantly lower costs compared to conventional
housing.[^3]

### Marinaleda

<a href="Marinaleda" class="wikilink" title="Marinaleda">Marinaleda</a>,
a town of 3,000 people located in Southern
<a href="Spain" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a>, shows us what
a new world of housing can look like. Although making an economic
transition in
<a href="Timeline_of_Anarchism_in_Southern_Europe" class="wikilink"
title="1979">1979</a> due to mass protests,
<a href="Strike" class="wikilink" title="strikes">strikes</a> and
<a href="Occupation_(Protest)" class="wikilink"
title="land occupations">land occupations</a>, it rose to fame in the
early 2010s in the midst of a massive economic crisis and housing bubble
in Spain. The town had full employment from self-managed farms and
factories and no
<a href="police" class="wikilink" title="police">police</a> force (being
called a "utopia for peace").

Houses of three bedrooms and gardens of 100 m2 could be lived in for 15
euros per month. The local government bought all the land around the
town and public grants and free assistance from professional builders is
provided. Zero homelessness has been achieved and the town has built a
school, a TV station, a radio station, parks, childcare centers, aged
care homes,
<a href="Healthcare" class="wikilink" title="doctors offices">doctors
offices</a> and a swimming pool since the transition.[^4]

### Squatter Communities

*See also:
<a href="List_of_Squats" class="wikilink" title="List of Squats">List of
Squats</a>*

Squatter communities also offer us an alternative vision of housing. In
<a href="Barcelona" class="wikilink" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>,
the famous <a href="Barcelona_Squatter_Community" class="wikilink"
title="squatter community">squatter community</a> manages to organise
free housing for thousands of people. Abandoned or rotting buildings are
fixed by squatters who teach themselves the skills they need along the
way, they fix up their new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing
windows, toilets, showers, light, kitchens, and anything else they need.
They often pirate electricity, water, and internet, and much of their
food comes from dumpster-diving, stealing, and squatted gardens.

Besides fixing up their own houses, squatters also work for their
neighborhoods and enrich their communities. Some social centers host
bicycle repair workshops, enabling people to repair or build their own
bicycles, using old parts. Others offer workshops on carpentry,
self-defense and yoga, natural healing, as well as libraries, gardens,
communal meals, art and theater groups, language classes, alternative
media and counterinformation, music shows, movies, computer labs where
people can use the
<a href="internet" class="wikilink" title="internet">internet</a> and
learn programming. Nearly all of these services are provided absolutely
free for the neighbourhood, which most non-squatters view as
beneficial.[^5]
