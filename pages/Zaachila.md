## History

### Pre-Hispanic Era

In the pre-Hispanic era, Zaachila was the main city-state for the Valley
of Oaxaca after the fall of
"<a   href="Monte_Albán.md" class="wikilink" title="Monte Albán">Monte
Albán</a>. The
"<a   href="Zapotec.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapotec">Zapotec</a> rulers of
Zaachila were the prominent political force for much of the Valley of
Oaxaca when the Spanish arrived.[^1] The name Zaachila comes from the
"<a   href="Zapotec_languages.md" class="wikilink"
title="Zapotec language">Zapotec language</a> and means "large leaf of
the purslane ("<a   href="Portulaca_oleracea.md" class="wikilink"
title="Portulaca oleracea">Portulaca oleracea</a>)".[^2]

After the fall of Monte Alban, the Valley of Oaxaca was divided into
city-states that shared a religious center at
"<a   href="Mitla.md" class="wikilink" title="Mitla">Mitla</a>. Starting
around 1400, there are five known rulers of the "Zaachila yoo" or "house
of Zaachila": Zaachila I, Zaachila II, Zaachila III,
"<a   href="Cosijoeza.md" class="wikilink" title="Cosijoeza">Cosijoeza</a> and
"<a   href="Cosijopii.md" class="wikilink" title="Cosijopii">Cosijopii</a>.[^3]
The territory faced threats from the
"<a   href="Mixtec.md" class="wikilink" title="Mixtec">Mixtecs</a> and
"<a   href="Aztec.md" class="wikilink" title="Aztec">Aztecs</a>, who sought to
control trade routes to the

title="Codex Zouche-Nuttall">Codex Zouche-Nuttall</a>\]\]

The last rulers, Cosijoeza and his son Cosijopii, lived during the
Spanish conquest. Both were baptized by the Spanish as Don Carlos
Cosijoeza and Don Juan Cortez respectively, and continued to control the
key town of "<a   href="Tehuantepec.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tehuantepec">Tehuantepec</a> after the Conquest.[^4]

### Background to Revolution

"<a   href="Environmentalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Environmentalist groups">Environmentalist groups</a> in the town
had been struggling against the construction of a Coca Cola factory
which would have destroyed much of the town's
"<a   href="Water.md" class="wikilink" title="water supply">water supply</a>
for years. This formed a strong network of activists and sense of
community among town citizens.

### The 2006 Revolution

During the "<a   href="Oaxaca_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Oaxaca Revolution">Oaxaca Revolution</a>, many residents met at
the town's church (called by ringing bells) and discussed the news of
police brutality and what their town should do. They eventually agreed
to take over the town hall, kicking out the mayor and using unlocked
offices and hallways. Out of this, a tradition of popular assembly was
born.

In June 2006, "<a   href="APPO.md" class="wikilink" title="APPO">APPO</a> took
over the municipal palace, being one of the first captured by the
dissidents during the unrest in Oaxaca state.[^5] This act eventually
evolved into the creation of a parallel government, a "people's
municipality," headed by Miguel Angel Hernandez Vazquez. This council
rejected the government of then municipal president Jose Coronel
Martinez and continues to reject the "constitutional" government of Noé
Pérez Martinez, accusing them of repression, abuse of authority,
nepotism and other charges.[^6]

## Organization

### Decision-Making

According to an anonymous activist and citizen of the town, decisions
are made using democratic assemblies:

> We'd say, "It's the neighborhood of La Soledad's turn and tomorrow
> it's up to San Jacinto." That's how the neighborhood assemblies were
> first used, and then later they turned into decision-making bodies,
> which is where we are now. The seizing of the municipal building was
> totally spontaneous. The activists from before played a role and
> initially directed things, but the popular assembly structure was
> developed little by little...Neighborhood assemblies, comprised of a
> rotating body of five people, were also formed in each section of town
> and together they would form the permanent popular assembly, the
> People's Council of Zaachila.[^7]

The neighborhood assemblies are completely open; anyone can attend and
have their voice heard. Decisions always go to a general vote, and all
adults present can vote. For example, if some people think a bridge
needs to be built, and others think there's a need to focus on improving
electricity, they vote on what the priority should be. The simple
majority wins - fifty percent plus one.

### Dual Power Structure

The town's support is divided between the two governments, with each
government controlling different aspects of the town. The constitutional
government has control of police and other services. The people's
government has control of business taxation, which raises about 6,000
pesos per month to provide services such as trash removal.

The "people's government" has received international support from
countries such as
"<a   href="Venezuela.md" class="wikilink" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>,
France, Spain, Germany, Canada and
"<a   href="Costa_Rica.md" class="wikilink" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>.[^8]
In 2007 the state legislature recognized the "closure of powers" of the
constitutional government but has not recognized the APPO-supported
government.[^9]

### Community Services

The townsfolk kicked out the mayor while maintaining public services,
and also established a community radio station - Radio Zaachila
("<a   href="XHZAA-FM.md" class="wikilink" title="XHZAA-FM">XHZAA-FM</a>
96.3). It is one of eight stations that began to operate around that
time and has been supported by Section 22 of the
"<a   href="Sindicato_Nacional_de_Trabajadores_de_la_Educación.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación">Sindicato
Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación</a> (Mexico's teachers'
union).[^10]
"<a   href="Cofetel.md" class="wikilink" title="Cofetel">Cofetel</a> awarded
an operating permit to Zaachila Radio in February 2010.

## Culture

### Neighborhoods and Festivals

The town is formed by ten neighborhoods: San Pedro, San Pablo, San José,
San Sebastián, San Jacinto, Del Carmen, Soledad, La Purísima, La Virgen
and Del Niño. Each has its own patron saint and corresponding festival.
Major celebrations include
"<a   href="Holy_Week.md" class="wikilink" title="Holy Week">Holy Week</a>
with
"<a   href="passion_play.md" class="wikilink" title="passion play">passion
plays</a> and processions, and "<a   href="Guelaguetza.md" class="wikilink"
title="Guelaguetza">Guelaguetza</a>, with a staging of the story of

### Thursday Market

Zaachila is famous for its Thursday open air markets
("<a   href="tianguis.md" class="wikilink" title="tianguis">tianguis</a>),
which spreads over much of the center of town and has been a tradition
since pre-Hispanic times.[^11] This market tradition dates back to
pre-Hispanic times and attracts Zapotec-speaking peoples from rural
areas. The market is divided into three sections: "Logueguindan" (plaza
of the people of the hills) for firewood and charcoal, animal sales, and
the main square with regional products and prepared foods.[^12]

### Dance of the Zancudos

Zaachila is known for a dance called the Danza de los Zancudos, or Dance
of the Stilts. This dance originated in the San Pedro neighborhood over
100 years ago as part of a promise to Saint Peter.[^13] Only men are
permitted to dance, with some wearing women's masks. The dancers perform
on two-meter stilts made from ocote wood and are trained for two months
after making a pledge to Saint Peter.

## Challenges

### Political Tensions

There have been numerous confrontations between supporters of the two
governments since 2006. Most confrontation has come in the form of
graffiti and political posters, though some violent incidents have
occurred. In 2008, the homes of Radio Zaachila broadcasters were shot at
due to their involvement in preventing a gubernatorial visit.

### Environmental Issues

### Land Trafficking

The municipality has problems with illegal trafficking of land,
particularly affecting an area called Zaachila Segundo where about 700
lots worth 50,000 pesos each are in question.[^14] About 18,000
inhabitants of the municipality lack sufficient water, electricity or
drainage services.

### Land Trafficking

### Archeological Site

</figure>

The "<a   href="Zaachila.md" class="wikilink"
title="archeological site of Zaachila">archeological site of
Zaachila</a> is next to the Church of Nuestra Señora de la Natividad,
the remains of the pre-Hispanic center of Zaachila, which was the local
capital when the Spanish arrived. At that time, it was considered to be
a second "<a   href="Tenochtitlan.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a>, as it sat on an island in the
middle of a lake. The site consists of mounds that define a ceremonial
plaza, though many constructions are currently covered by modern
structures. Although largely un-excavated, two tombs were discovered at
the site in 1962, thought to belong to important
"<a   href="Mixtec.md" class="wikilink" title="Mixtec">Mixtec</a> persons and
containing interesting grave goods.

## Economy

Much of the economy is based on small-scale farming and livestock
raising as well as commerce. Agriculture occupies the majority of the
land but only employs 15% of the people. Crops include fruit trees
(apples, peaches, pears, oranges, limes), grains (corn), and vegetables
(beans, "<a   href="nopal.md" class="wikilink" title="nopal">nopals</a>).
Mining and industries employ 27% while commerce, tourism and services
employ about 55%.

## Evaluation

Author "<a   href="Peter_Gelderloos.md" class="wikilink"

governmental situation to be a partial example of a functioning

society.

## Evaluation

### Environmental Issues

The municipality hosts the only
"<a   href="open_dump.md" class="wikilink" title="open dump">open dump</a> for
the entire Oaxaca city area, established about thirty years ago to
receive waste from the city of Oaxaca and 18 other municipalities.[^15]
The dump contains about 650 tons of trash and is located in a
geologically vulnerable zone. Many neighborhoods built near it are
experiencing health problems due to contaminated ground water and
airborne bacteria.
