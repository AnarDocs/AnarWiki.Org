The Paliyans are an egalitarian, immediate-return foraging people in
south India.[^1]

The website *Peaceful Societies* summarizes:

> "The Paliyans have a very atomistic, anarchistic society, with each
> individual making his or her own decisions. They have a strong desire
> for autonomy, which shows up in their psychological structures. They
> refrain from forming emotional ties except within their nuclear
> families. Ties with other relatives will be friendly but not effusive.
> They emphasize their autonomy through their code of nonviolence—and
> they will express their belief that one should turn the other cheek if
> one is struck in the face."[^2]
