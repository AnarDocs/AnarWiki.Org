This list gives a basic learning and organising guide:[^1]

## Learn something, learn everything, learn nothing

Knowledge is both power and protection, but it must be balanced with
practical experience and critical thinking. Understanding history,
theory, and skills helps us avoid repeating mistakes and recognise
patterns as they emerge. However, we must remain flexible in our
thinking and learn through direct experience rather than just books.

**Learn Something:**

- Study core resistance theory and successful movements
- Master essential practical skills (first aid, encryption, growing
  food)
- Learn your local area (resources, community needs)

**Learn Everything:**

- Read widely across movements, history, and even speculative fiction
- Develop diverse practical skills and organizational approaches
- Build understanding of interconnected struggles and systems

**Learn Nothing:**

- Question propaganda and official narratives
- Learn through direct experience rather than just theory
- Stay flexible and avoid dogmatic thinking

**Learning Suggestion:** **Join / start a radical book / movie club**

- Find if one already exists and support it - in person or online
- Start one - Find a local radical venue, a library or community centre,
  a cafÃ©, or just use your home
- Advertise your group online and IRL - meetup, Facebook, flyers,
  posters, convincing friends to come along
- Pick books to read / movies to watch between you

## Do something, do everything, do nothing

Action gives meaning to knowledge and builds real-world capability.
Getting involved in community projects and dual power / prefiguration
initiatives creates networks of support and resistance before theyâ€™re
desperately needed. However, strategic inaction is sometimes as
important as action - knowing when to step back, when to rest, and - if
already in a dystopia - when to remain invisible.

**Do Something:**

- Join focused local groups (mutual aid projects, community gardens)
- Take direct action on specific causes you care about
- Join a syndicalist union or similar worker organization

**Do Everything:**

- Be active in multiple community groups, especially neighbourhood ones
- Support various strikes and protests
- Participate in different mutual aid initiatives

**Do Nothing:**

- Avoid groups that might morally compromise you
- Know when to step back to prevent burnout
- Stay under the radar when the situation requires it

**Doing Suggestion 1:**Â **Start / Join An Assembly**

- Find or create a regular neighbourhood meeting space
- Start with small issues that affect local people
- Practice consensus decision making
- Build connections between different local groups and issues
- Create working groups for specific projects

Here isÂ [Crimethincâ€™s in depth guide to
Assemblies](https://crimethinc.com/2024/11/10/how-to-organize-an-assembly-preparing-to-respond-to-an-era-of-disasters-and-despotism)
&Â [Extinction Rebellionâ€™s
one](https://extinctionrebellion.uk/act-now/resources/peoples-assemblies/)

**Doing Suggestion 2:**Â **Community Garden Project**

- Find unused land or join existing garden / food co-op
  </li>
- Learn growing skills and share produce
  </li>
- Build food independence while creating community bonds
  </li>
- Network with other local gardens and food projects

(U.K.)](https://www.farmgarden.org.uk/)

</li>

</ul>

Realise that not everyone is as politically aware as you and may be
scared by certain labels and so adapt your interactions to account for
this.

## Say something, say everything, say nothing

Communication builds solidarity and breaks isolation, helping others
realize theyâ€™re not alone in their concerns. Creating secure channels
for sharing information and documenting events is crucial for both
current organizing and future reference. Yet - if living under a
dystopia - knowing when to remain silent is equally important for
protecting yourself and others.

**Say Something:**

- Speak up about specific issues while you safely can (to help others
  feel less isolated)
- Share useful information and resources with trusted people
- Document what you witness for future reference

**Say Everything:**

- Be vocal about issues in safe spaces and trusted circles
- Share stories that need to be heard to build solidarity
- Teach others what youâ€™ve learned when you can

**Say Nothing:**

- Know when strategic silence is necessary
- Protect sensitive information about yourself and others
- Avoid oversharing on social media

**Speaking Up Suggestion 1:**Â **Start a Private Comms Group for
Concerned Friends / Family**

- Choose secure platforms (Signal, Matrix, etc.)
- Start with trusted friends who share concerns
- Share resources and organize meetups safely
- Create guidelines for security and privacy
- Build trust before expanding membership

**Speaking Up Suggestion 2:**Â **Start a Local Newsletter/Zine**

- Share local news and resources
- Build connections between different groups
- Keep it low-tech (printable) for wider access
- Include practical tips and upcoming events
- Leave it in cafes, libraries, bookstores, arts & radical spaces

## Prepare something, prepare everything, prepare nothing

Preparation provides confidence and capability, but must be balanced
against the risks of obvious stockpiling or rigid plans. Building basic
readiness through skills and supplies helps weather difficulties, while
maintaining flexibility allows adaptation to unexpected challenges.

**Prepare Something:**

- Protect essential information (encryption, secure devices, safe
  communications)
- Create basic emergency plans (go-bag, evacuation routes, emergency
  contacts)
- Stock fundamental supplies and master basic skills

**Prepare Everything:**

- Build comprehensive security systems (digital security, safe houses,
  backup systems)
- Establish multiple support networks and communication methods
- Store diverse resources and develop various skills

**Prepare Nothing:**

- Maintain unpredictable routines and patterns
- Keep some plans deliberately vague and flexible
- Practice strategic insecurity (avoid obvious preparation patterns)

**Preparations Suggestion 1:**Â **Digital security steps**

- Move email to secure providers outside your country
- Use VPNs and encrypted messaging
- Join federated social networks like Mastodon
- Learn about data privacy and security
- Help others make the switch safely

See EFFâ€™sÂ [Surveillance Self-Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/)

**Preparations Suggestion 2:**Â **Camping trips as emergency prep**

[Emergency prep simple kit
(U.S.)](https://www.ready.gov/kit)Â -Â Â [General survival readiness
(U.K.)](https://www.ready.gov/publications)

- Practice essential skills in a fun context
- Learn about navigation and foraging
- Test out emergency equipment
- Build group cohesion and trust
- Make preparation feel like an adventure

See -Â [Prepping
Basics](https://theprepared.com/prepping-basics/)Â &Â [Urban
Survival](https://urbansurvivalsite.com/)

**Example 3:**Â **Skill-sharing Workshops**

- Organize workshops teaching practical skills
- Rotate teachers to share different expertise
- Build community while building capability
- Focus on useful everyday skills that could be vital later

## Help something, prepare everything, prepare nothing

Mutual aid and solidarity create resilient communities that can better
resist oppression and support each other through difficulties. Building
networks of support and sharing resources helps create alternative
systems outside official control. However, maintaining boundaries and
avoiding burnout ensures sustainable long-term assistance.

**Help Someone:**

- Support specific causes with targeted skills and resources
- Create safe spaces and share growing spaces/land
- Provide concrete assistance where needed

**Help Everyone:**

- Build wide support networks and mutual aid systems
- Develop alternative economies and sustainable systems
- Share diverse resources and energy across communities

**Help No-one:**

- Be selective about assistance (avoid supporting harmful systems)
- Maintain personal boundaries and know your limits
- Keep some resources in reserve for sustainability

**Helping Suggestion 1:**Â **Food bank/co-op participation**

- Volunteer regularly to learn systems
- Build relationships with other volunteers
- Understand local food security issues
- Learn about food distribution and storage
- Connect with other mutual aid projects

See -Â [Food Not Bombs](https://foodnotbombs.net/new_site/)

**Helping Suggestion 2:**Â **Tool Library**

- Collect and share useful tools
- Teach maintenance and repair skills
- Build community self-reliance
- Reduce individual costs while increasing collective resources

SeeÂ [Library Of Things](https://www.libraryofthings.co.uk/)Â example

  Aid to others
- Consider supporting radical bloggers, podcasters etc. on Subtack,
  patreon etc.

## Enjoy something, enjoy everything, enjoy nothing

Joy and celebration are forms of resistance themselves, building
community bonds and maintaining morale through difficult times. Creating
spaces for genuine connection and happiness helps sustain long-term
struggle and reminds us what weâ€™re fighting for. Finding internal peace
while staying engaged in resistance helps maintain long-term commitment.

**Cultivate personal joys**

- Personal hobbies and creative outlets - for fun not money
- Shared good times with friends

**Find joy in resistance**

- Celebrate small victories
- Build joyful communities

**Practice detachment**

- Donâ€™t depend on external happiness
- Find peace in uncertainty

Itâ€™s okay not to be okay, sadness is part of life too. Hope encourages
some people to action, lack of hope encourages others to action instead.
Just know that youâ€™re not alone and that people care.

**Fun Suggestion 1:**Â **Dance/Party organizing**

- Create safe spaces for community joy
- Use events to build connections
- Raise funds for local causes
- Practice security culture in a fun way
- Build collective joy and resistance

## Things to watch out for

- People wanting to establish another dictatorship to combat the one you
  are increasingly living under.
- People who want to distract you with woo - Iâ€™m all for inner peace,
  but it wonâ€™t save the world.
- People who want you to join their cult, give them all your money.
- People who want to blow everything up right now - they are usually
  cops.
- People who tell you the answer to all your problems is sleeping with
  them - I hate that there are still some sleazy individuals amongst
  radicals, but be aware in case you meet one. Otherwise form as many
  joyful consensual relationships as you want, realising that the
  rebellion often outlasts the relationship.

Maybe nothing bad will happen, or peace and harmony will break out
tomorrow with the return of King Arthur. But if things donâ€™t get worse
then you may have made some good friends and learnt some interesting
things, and maybe youâ€™ll conclude that the world could be a lot better
and helped started the process of making it so.
