## What Is a Supracracy?

A Supracracy is a proposed future state of society—a framework for human
life beyond survival economics, beyond coercion, and beyond hierarchy.
The name itself derives from the ideas of superseding currency and
property as organizing principles, and transcending hierarchy through
direct democracy—where individuals represent themselves, not parties or
rulers.

The goal of Supracracy is not merely to destroy hierarchy, but to render
it so obsolete, so alien to human life, that no one in their right mind
would ever seek to rebuild it.—a framework for human life beyond
survival economics, beyond coercion, and beyond hierarchy.

Unlike Communism, which envisions a stateless, classless society built
on collective ownership of production, Supracracy is the culmination of
a world post-labor and post-scarcity and post-state. It is not defined
by ownership, but by abolition and prefiguration—the abolition of
survival as a driving force, the abolition of hierarchy as a social
structure, and the abolition of markets and money as distribution
mechanisms, coupled with the construction of liberated, voluntary
systems in their place. Supracracy lives its values now, wherever it
can, building the future in the shell of the present.

At its core, Supracracy is an anarchist vision rooted in both individual
autonomy and voluntary collectivity. It does not call for replacing the
current ruling class with a new one—it demands the end of ruling classes
altogether. The State, the Church, and the Corporation are seen not as
reformable institutions, but as obsolete power structures that must be
dismantled.

## Origins

The origins are a mix of Libertarian Municipalism (Murray Bookchin),
Kropotkin's Conquest of Bread, and Öcalan's Democratic Confederalist and
can be best described as Anarchist Confederalism at scale. Its author,
Dominick Black, is an Anarchist living in America.
