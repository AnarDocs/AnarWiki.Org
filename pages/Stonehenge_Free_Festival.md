Works</a>:

> In England, a yearly festival of travellers and hippies that converged
> at Stonehenge to mark the summer solstice became a major
> counter-cultural autonomous zone and an experiment in “collective
> anarchy.” Beginning in 1972, the Stonehenge Free Festival was a
> gathering that lasted for the month of June until the solstice. More
> than a music festival, it was a non-hierarchical space for the
> creation of music, art, and new relationships, as well as spiritual
> and psychedelic exploration. It became an essential ritual and social
> event in England’s growing traveller culture. By 1984, it drew 30,000
> participants who created a self-organized village for the month. In
> the words of one participant, it was “Anarchy. And it worked.”[^1] The
> Thatcher regime saw it as a threat; in 1985 they banned the
> 14<sup>th</sup> annual Stonehenge Free Festival, brutally attacking
> the several hundred people who came to set it up in an assault known
> as the Battle of the Beanfield.
