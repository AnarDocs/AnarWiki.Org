China's Yellow Turban rebellion lasted from 184 to 205 CE. John Clark
refers to the "Taoist Yellow Turbans, a revolutionary, egalitarian
movement of the second century."[^1]

Ngo Van Xuyet elaborates:

> The members of the Taoist cults, which the powerful considered to be
> “Demon Religions” (guidao) that were opposed to the official orthodox
> cults, were condemned to death. The torture of a religious teacher and
> the execution of more than one thousand adepts of the Taiping Dao in
> Luoyang, the capital, led to an insurrection during the second month
> of 184. The insurgents wore, as a symbol of their membership in the
> cult, a yellow turban, the color of the Yellow Heaven, for which
> reason they were called Yellow Turbans, or Ant-Rebels because of their
> vast numbers.
>
> They seized several cities, important urban centers in Shandong and
> Henan provinces, despite the resistance of the imperial troops of
> Luoyang. The government officials fled or were killed. Government
> buildings were burned. After they seized the cities of Shandong and
> Henan, they occupied the mountainous region of Taishan (between Shanxi
> and Shandong) in 185 A.D.; in 186, they took Shanxi, Hubei and
> Leaotong; and in 188, Shaanxi. The patriarch Zhang Jiao and his two
> brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang died early in the fighting and
> imperial repression caused terrible devastation and thousands of
> insurgents were killed. This did not prevent the Yellow Turbans from
> raising an army of several hundred thousand men in various provinces.
> Despite their defeat, their influence persisted.[^2]
