The groove-billed ani is a black bird with a long tail and large beak
that lives in Latin America and southern Texas. Part of the cuckoo
family, it lives in pastures and other open areas, and it feeds on
insects and other arthopods.[^1] The biologist Sandra Vehrencamp places
the groove-billed ani on the egalitarian end of the
"egalitarian-despotic spectrum" that she has developed.

"The groove-billed anis (*Crotophaga* spp.) are an excellent example of
a relatively unbiased society," Vehrencamp writes, with the term "bias"
referring to the degree of despotism in a species. The groove-billed
anis live in groups of one to four monogamous breeding pairs. They share
a communal nest, and the males and females all participate in incubating
the eggs.

A female with "slight" dominance over other females will lay her eggs
last and will throw some of the other females' eggs out of the nest
before she has laid her own eggs. This gives this female a slightly
higher chance of reproductive success. The males, however, do not
demonstrate dominance over each other. In fact, the male who who mates
with the slightly dominant female usually has to preform all of the
night-time incubation and therefore has a higher risk of mortality than
the other males. As a result, the males all have an equal reproductive
success rate over their lifetimes.[^2]
