In 2013, indigenous Mi'kmaq campaigners successfully prevented fracking
on their land in so-called "New Brunswick, Canada." They employed a
diversity of tactics including road blockades and clashes with police.
About a month before their victory, the *Toronto Sun* fretted "Militant
Natives are causing trouble, and they aren’t going away."

> They block roads, stop trains and fight the cops. Men and women
> dressed in camouflage, boots and bandanas. They come from reserves,
> wave red flags, set fires, tear up roads and declare sovereignty for

> business.[^1]

The fight took place on traditional Mi'kmaq land that Natives call
Signigtog. South Western Energy Resources Canada and Irving Oil proposed
drilling there for natural gas, and the gas would mostly be sent to the
"United States." The company began testing on the land on 5 June 2013.

In June and July, Mi'kmaq warriors and accomplices blockaded several
large highways by building encampments, human chains, and barricades of
burning tires.

On 30 July, Mi'kmaq negotiators agreed to temporarily allow the drillers
to perform seismic testing. On 28 September, resistance resumed as
Mi'kmaq and Elsipogtog warriors blockaded South Western trucks. This 500
person-strong blockade lasted for two weeks.[^2] Suzanne Patles of the
Mi'kmaq Warrior Society explained the blockade's economic impact on
South Western: "This barricade that has been happening here on this SWN
Resource compound has been costing the company upwards of \$60,000 per
day, which is what they have stated in their court proceedings."[^3]

On 17 October, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided the encampment
and fired rubber bullets and pepper spray at the land defenders.
Protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. Six police cars were
burnt, apparently in an act of retaliation. Police cleared the
encampment by evening.[^4]

There were claims that the fire was started by an agent provocateur.[^5]
However, the researcher Hayden Dahm writes that the cop cars were burned
by participants in the struggle. In a post on *Warrior Publications*,
the Kwakwaka’wakw writer Zig Zag (Gord Hill) agrees: "If police are
going to go through the efforts of staging an attack on their own
resources, it is only logical they would do this prior to a raid thereby
justifying the raid itself. It is highly unlikely they would instruct an
informant to do so after the raid has begun, a raid already justified by
'public safety' concerns, etc. In fact, the burning of the six police
vehicles appears to be a response to the raid." [^6]

On 1 December, Mi'kmaq warriors shut down a major highway for several
hours. The indigenous movement Idle No More called for a Canada-wide day
of action to be held the following day. People held many demonstrations
and road blockades, and one blockade even shut down the Vancouver port
for a few hours.[^7]

In 2014, a provincial election "was seen as a plebiscite on fracking"
according to Gord Hill. Voters threw out the pro-fracking government,
and the incoming administration enacted a moratorium on fracking. Hill
favorably compares the Mi'kmaq diversity of tactics to the more
pacifistic Standing Rock struggle in the "United States": "The Mi’kmaq,
even though they were much smaller in numbers than what we saw at
Standing Rock, and with far less resources, were victorious."[^8]
