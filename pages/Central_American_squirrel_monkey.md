Central American squirrel monkeys (*S. oerstedti*), found in forests of
Costa Rica and Panama, eat fruits and insects and are preyed on by
raptors and snakes. They exhibit no hierarchy between males and females
or among females, and very little hierarchy among males. They typically
live in groups of 40 to 65 animals.[^1]

Cooperation is widespread among the squirrel monkeys. While the females
perform most of child-raising, males vigorously defend the infants.[^2]
Males cooperate to defend their community from predators and in
investigating females and aggression toward neighboring groups.[^3]

Young squirrel monkeys spend most of their time playing, and friendships
formed in the early play groups often end up being life-long.[^4]

The Central American squirrel monkey belongs to the *Saimiri* genus.
South America's squirrel monkey species are far more hierarchical. The
difference in social organization may have to do with how fruit is
distributed. Central American squirrel monkeys forage large fruit
patches, where they tend to find few fruits at a time and quickly move
on to other patches. Peru's squirrel monkeys (*S. boliviensis*),
however, tend to find large amounts of fruit at a time, and members of a
group compete for the fruit. Common squirrel monkeys (*S. sciureus*)
tend to find fruit concentrated in small patches, so members of a group
will fiercely compete to control the small patch.[^5]

The Central American squirrel monkey is threatened by deforestation,
forest fragmentation, and hunting.[^6]
