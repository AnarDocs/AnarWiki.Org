# Anarchist Farm

Anarchist Farm is an allegorical novel by Jane Doe published in August
1996 by III Publishing. The book presents an anarchist response to
George Orwell's
<a href="Animal_Farm" class="wikilink" title="Animal Farm">Animal
Farm</a>, showing how animals organize themselves without hierarchy or
leadership to resist corporate control and state power.

## Overview

The novel follows multiple interconnected storylines across several
animal communities. The Circle H farm operates through consensus
decision-making after the death of its human caretaker Margaret.
Meanwhile, Pancho, a pig fleeing a failed authoritarian revolution on
his home farm, joins forest defenders who sabotage logging operations.
These narratives converge when the Circle H farm faces foreclosure by a
corporation, triggering a mass uprising.

The book explores themes of mutual aid, direct action, non-hierarchical
organization, and spontaneous mass revolt. Characters grapple with
questions of violence versus non-violence, the role of leadership, and
how different species with different interests can work together against
a common enemy.

## Plot

The story begins at Circle H farm, where animals have been running the
farm themselves since their human Margaret fell ill. After her death,
they continue operating the farm cooperatively, guided by Margaret's
principle: "treat others as you wish to be treated." The farm has no
leaders and makes decisions by consensus.

Across the forest, a pig named Pancho escapes from his old farm after a
revolution he helped lead descended into tyranny, with pigs seizing
control and murdering dissenters. He encounters forest defenders living
at Cave Camp - bears, raccoons, squirrels, a monkey named Bonkers, and
his former farmmate Sabo the cat. These animals conduct sabotage
operations against logging equipment to protect the forest.

Pancho and Sabo visit the Circle H farm while foraging for apples and
meet its residents: Goldie the golden retriever, Rosy the cow, llamas
Carlos and Juanita, pigs Sally, Suzy, and Martha, mule Jethro, sheep
Bob, and goat Gruff. The farm animals discover they face an auction on
Saturday, June 10, as a corporation tries to seize the property.

The animals prepare for the auction by organizing a free concert with
the rat punk band "Free Radicals." They discover that rabbits Blackstone
and Hamilton, supposedly legal advisors, are actually corporate spies
with a cell phone connecting them to the FBI, CIA, and corporate
headquarters. The rabbits are imprisoned at the neighboring kennel.

On the day of the concert, animals from various communities gather to
discuss their common struggles against corporate power. The next
morning, government forces massacre the armed dogs at the kennel. When a
soldier approaches the barn full of animals, Goldie the dog tries
peaceful resistance but is shot. Sabo attacks the soldier, and mule
Jethro kills him.

These deaths, combined with the death of the Sacred Cow (Rosy's mother),
trigger the Great Stampede - a spontaneous mass uprising where all
animals run together as one unified force. The stampede grows as it
moves toward the city, with animals from the horse ranch and zoo joining
in. Even the soldiers refuse to shoot and kill their commander instead.

At corporate headquarters, the animals capture the CEO and the rabbit
spies. After a trial, the CEO is found guilty and sentenced to plant
trees for the rest of his life. The animals vote to abolish the
corporation, government, and banks, returning to "their natural state of
freedom."

The epilogue takes place one year later. The Circle H farm has been
renamed Circle A (the anarchist symbol). Pancho and Sally have three
piglets. Bob, Gruff, and Pancho edit the Circle-A Free Press. The annual
celebration brings together all the communities.

## Themes

The book critiques hierarchical organization, showing how leadership
inevitably leads to tyranny. Pancho's old farm demonstrates this
trajectory, while Circle H shows an alternative based on consensus and
mutual aid.

The novel explores diversity of tactics in resistance movements. Some
characters advocate strict non-violence while others see violence as
sometimes necessary against oppression. The book does not resolve this
tension but shows characters wrestling with it.

The Great Stampede represents spontaneous mass action that emerges from
collective consciousness rather than vanguard organization. Sacred Cow
teaches that it cannot be planned or controlled - revolutionaries can
only "plant seeds" and wait for conditions to ripen.

Corporate power appears as the fundamental antagonist. The book argues
that corporations own the government, media, banks, and police, making
electoral politics meaningless. The solution is not reform but abolition
of these hierarchical structures.

Identity politics and artificial divisions receive critique through the
conflict between poodles and shepherds over jobs. The book argues that
such divisions serve corporate interests by preventing working-class
unity.

The importance of mutual aid and voluntary cooperation appears
throughout. Animals help each other across species lines, sharing
resources and skills without coercion or hierarchy.

## Style and Influences

The book openly acknowledges its debt to George Orwell's *Animal Farm*
in the thanks section. However, it inverts Orwell's pessimistic
conclusions about revolution, showing anarchist organization succeeding
where authoritarian socialism failed.

References to historical anarchist struggles appear throughout.
"Cat-alonia" references the Spanish Civil War and revolutionary
Catalonia. The "Woollies" represent the Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW), nicknamed "Wobblies."

The allegorical style allows the book to discuss political theory
through animal characters. Different species represent different sectors
of the working class, while their common struggle against the
corporation mirrors real-world class conflict.

## Publication

*Anarchist Farm* was published by III Publishing in August 1996 with
ISBN 1886625018. The cover art was created by Lynne Margulies.

The book received praise from Utah Phillips, Hakim Bey, and Judi Bari.
Phillips called it "an intelligent, quirky, funny and often ironic
parable" about revolutionary change. Hakim Bey wrote that "Orwell was
channelled; he approved." Judi Bari described it as "a fast-paced fable
in the tradition of Orwell's Animal Farm" that "illustrates a positive
alternative."
