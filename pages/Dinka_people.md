> The Dinka are a people numbering some 900,000 living on the fringe of
> the central Nile basin in the Southern Sudan. (A correspondent of The
> Sunday Times remarked of them that 'touchiness, pride and reckless
> disobedience are their characteristic reaction towards authority'.)
> Godfrey Lienhardt's contribution to *Tribes Without Rulers* describes
> their intricately subdivided society and the very complicated
> inter-relation­ ships resulting from the fusion and fission of segments
> in different combinations for different economic and functional
> purposes.

> The Dinka explain their cellular sub-division with such phrases as 'It
> became too big, so it separated' and 'They were together long ago but
> now they have separated.' They value the unity of their tribes and
> descent groups but at the same time they value the feeling for
> autonomy in the component segments which lead to fragmentation, and Dr
> Lienhardt observes that 'these values of personal autonomy and of its
> several sub-segments are from time to time in conflict'.
