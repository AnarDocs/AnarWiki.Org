# Patriarchy

**Patriarchy** is a
<a href="social_system" class="wikilink" title="social system">social
system</a> in which positions of
<a href="authority" class="wikilink" title="authority">authority</a> and
<a href="power" class="wikilink" title="power">power</a> are primarily
held by men, and in which men as a group dominate women and other
genders both structurally and ideologically.[^1] The term describes both
family structures controlled by male authority figures and broader
social structures of male dominance that permeate political, economic,
and cultural institutions.

Patriarchy functions as a highly totalitarian system which regulates
lives in profoundly personal and invasive ways, exerting control at both
informal interpersonal levels and through formal political structures
including the <a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>,
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
and religious institutions.[^2]

## Overview

At its core, patriarchy operates through the assignment of
<a href="gender" class="wikilink" title="gender">gender</a> categories
at birth without consent, typically based on visible genitalia. This
assignment then determines social roles, expectations, behaviors, and
access to power throughout an individual's life.[^3]

**Bell hooks** described patriarchy as "a political-social system that
insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and
everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to
dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through
various forms of psychological terrorism and violence."[^4]

Patriarchy encompasses multiple interconnected oppressions including
<a href="sexism" class="wikilink" title="sexism">sexism</a>,
<a href="transphobia" class="wikilink"

<a href="homophobia" class="wikilink" title="homophobia">homophobia</a>,
biphobia, and intersexism, which together form a single oppressive
gender system.

## Historical Development

### Origins

The origins of patriarchy remain contested among scholars and activists.
Anarchist geographer **Élisée Reclus** argued that patriarchy originated
not through gradual evolution but through violent causes and sudden
events, fundamentally distinct from earlier
<a href="matriarchy" class="wikilink"
title="matriarchal">matriarchal</a> or egalitarian social forms.[^5]

According to Reclus, the first patriarchal family in the historical
sense had the same origin as the
<a href="State" class="wikilink" title="State">State</a> itself. The
victorious leader seizes territory and all inhabitants within it, with
each warrior in the conquering group receiving a share of plunder
including land, objects, and people. The *pater familias* or family
master was not originally considered the biological progenitor but
rather the protector and owner of all persons and property that had
fallen to him through conquest or inheritance.[^6]

### Relationship to Economic Systems

For much of human history, the difficulty in controlling fertility and
the strong relationship between physical labor and bodily strength made
gender categorization fundamental to social organization. Following the
<a href="agricultural_revolution" class="wikilink"
title="agricultural revolution">agricultural revolution</a>,
<a href="class" class="wikilink" title="class">class</a> systems
developed where legal aspects from inheritance to personal independence
were strongly tied to assigned gender. Women were often literally made
the property of men.[^7]

Among nomadic and pastoral peoples, males who captured, tamed, and
managed livestock asserted rights over women, who were designated for
meal preparation and childcare. Patriarchy became particularly
entrenched among pastoralists who were simultaneously warriors seeking
to enslave other populations.[^8]

## Mechanisms of Patriarchal Control

### Socialization and Violence

Patriarchal ideology is transmitted through socialization processes that
begin in early childhood. Children are assigned gender roles and given
continual guidance about fulfilling these roles through family,
religious institutions, schools, and other social structures.[^9]

**Bell hooks** emphasized that to indoctrinate boys into patriarchal
rules, society forces them to experience pain and deny their feelings.
This "normal traumatization" uses shame and violence to enforce gender
conformity. Girls similarly face violence and psychological coercion to
accept subordinate roles.[^10]

The use of violence to reinforce acceptance of patriarchy occurs most
commonly within families, where patriarchal parents use domination to
maintain authority. This violence functions to reinforce a dominator
model in which authority figures rule over those without power through
subjugation, subordination, and submission.[^11]

### Rule of Silence

Patriarchal culture maintains itself through collective silence about
its impacts. Keeping males and females from telling the truth about
family violence protects the rule of the father. An unspoken cultural
rule demands secrecy about patriarchy, and this silence is upheld by
denying easy access even to the word "patriarchy" itself. Most children
never learn what to call this system of institutionalized gender roles,
which promotes denial and prevents organized challenges to the
system.[^12]

### Psychological Patriarchy

Beyond political and economic structures, patriarchy operates
psychologically as a dynamic where qualities deemed "masculine" are
exalted while those deemed "feminine" are devalued. Both men and women
participate in this system. Psychological patriarchy manifests as a
perverse form of connection that replaces genuine intimacy with complex
layers of dominance and submission, collusion and manipulation.[^13]

## Impact on Men and Masculinity

Contrary to popular perception, patriarchy significantly harms men as
well as women. **Bell hooks** described patriarchy as "the single most
life-threatening social disease assaulting the male body and spirit."
Patriarchy denies males access to full emotional wellbeing by demanding
they become and remain emotional cripples. It forces men into rigid
roles that require dominance, aggression, and emotional
suppression.[^14]

The system creates a crisis not of masculinity itself but of
**patriarchal masculinity**. Men are brainwashed to believe their
domination of women is beneficial when it actually damages them. Because
patriarchy is a system denying men full access to freedom of will, it
becomes difficult for men of any class to rebel against it or be
disloyal to patriarchal authority.[^15]

## Relationship to Other Systems of Oppression

Patriarchy does not operate in isolation but interconnects with other
oppressive systems. Many anarchists use the phrase "imperialist
white-supremacist capitalist patriarchy" to describe these interlocking
political systems that form the foundation of contemporary society.[^16]

Patriarchy is supported and spread by
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and the <a href="State" class="wikilink" title="State">State</a>.
Therefore the struggle against patriarchy must be tied to struggles
against capital and state.[^17]

## Contemporary Context

Modern society possesses technology to control fertility, making
childbirth a choice. Industrialization and automation have made physical
strength increasingly irrelevant for labor. Despite these material
changes, contemporary society has inherited rigid gender systems that
treat binary gender distinction as fundamental in ways that other human
variations are not.[^18]

Traditional institutions, particularly the
<a href="Catholic_Church" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>, have responded by doubling
down on attempts to impose rigid gender divisions. Simultaneously, a
broad revolt against rigid binary gender segregation has emerged, with
increasing numbers openly rejecting assigned gender categories and
roles.[^19]

## Anarchist Analysis and Abolition

### Feminism as Revolutionary Struggle

<a href="Feminism" class="wikilink" title="Feminism">Feminism</a> is the
movement and ideology seeking to replace patriarchy with an equal and
free society. Anarchist organizations committed to liberation understand
feminism as fundamental to revolutionary politics.[^20]

### Strategy for Abolition

Abolishing patriarchy requires exposing and challenging both its
psychological manifestations and its concrete expressions in daily life.
This work must be done collectively by people of all genders.[^21]

The goal is not necessarily to eliminate gender entirely but to
eliminate the coercion behind gender. A society liberated from
patriarchy would be one where gender, including sexual orientation, is
freely expressed without carrying privileges or penalties. At that
point, gender would likely fade in social significance.[^22]

Unity within the
<a href="working_class" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a> across divides of gender and sexuality is essential, as all
working people ultimately have more in common than not. However, this
unity cannot assume automatic equality but must actively address
differences in experience and power.[^23]

Because women's liberation and
<a href="LGBTQIA" class="wikilink" title="LGBTQIA">LGBTQIA</a>
liberation are products of the same oppressive gender system, effective
movements build solidarity among all people oppressed by patriarchy in a
common struggle for freedom.[^24]
