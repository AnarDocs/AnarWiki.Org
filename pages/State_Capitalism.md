# State Capitalism

## Overview

State capitalism is an economic system in which the state undertakes
business and commercial economic activity, with the means of production
nationalized as state-owned enterprises. While proponents claim it
represents a transition to socialism, anarchists argue that state
capitalism is fundamentally a system of exploitation where the state
becomes the primary capitalist, maintaining the capital-labor
relationship while crushing workers' self-management and revolutionary
potential.

From an anarchist perspective, state capitalism represents one of the
most dangerous forms of counter-revolution, as it disguises itself in
revolutionary rhetoric while creating new forms of domination. Whether
implemented by Marxist-Leninist parties claiming to build socialism or
by traditional capitalist states during crises, state capitalism
maintains and intensifies the fundamental exploitation of capitalism
while adding the coercive power of the state.

## Origins

### Early Predictions and Warnings

The concept of state capitalism was first theoretically developed by
Friedrich Engels in **Anti-Dühring** (1880) and **Socialism: Utopian and
Scientific**. Engels predicted that capitalism would evolve toward
greater concentration, with the state ultimately taking control of
production. However, he warned that "the transformation...into state
ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the
productive forces... The modern state... is essentially a capitalist
machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the
total national capital."[^1]

Mikhail Bakunin, the founder of the international anarchist movement,
was perhaps the first to recognize the counter-revolutionary potential
of state socialism. He warned that Marxist programs would lead to
"...the rule of the new society by socialist savants—is the worst of all
despotic governments."[^2] Bakunin predicted that former workers "as
soon as they become the rulers of the representatives of the people,
will cease to be workers and will look down at the plain working masses
from the governing heights of the state."[^3]

Peter Kropotkin explicitly identified the danger in 1910: "The
anarchists consider... that to hand over to the state all the main
sources of economic life... would mean to create a new instrument of
tyranny. State capitalism would only increase the powers of bureaucracy
and capitalism."[^4]

### The Soviet Experience

The Russian Revolution provided the first major test of these
predictions. While Lenin initially used the term "state capitalism"
positively, arguing it would be "a step forward" compared to Russia's
backward economy,[^5] anarchists immediately recognized the
counter-revolutionary nature of Bolshevik policies.

Emma Goldman, witnessing the Soviet system firsthand, declared in 1935:
"Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it
would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic... Soviet
Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and
the crassest form of state capitalism economically."[^6]

The Bolsheviks established a one-party state that outlawed all other
parties, including socialist ones, banned independent unions and
strikes, and created a vast system of police repression. By 1921, they
had created the juridical framework for totalitarianism.[^7] The state
became "the ideal personification of the total national capital,"
exactly as Engels had warned.

## Tendencies

### Stalinist State Capitalism

Under Stalin, the Soviet Union developed into a fully consolidated state
capitalist system. The bureaucracy became a new ruling class, managing
nationalized property while exploiting workers through the same
capital-labor relationship found in traditional capitalism. Workers were
paid wages to buy commodities they had produced, creating surplus value
appropriated by the bureaucratic ruling class.[^8]

This system spread internationally through Communist parties, creating
similar regimes in China, Eastern Europe, Cuba, and elsewhere. Each
maintained the fundamental characteristics of capitalism: commodity
production, wage labor, capital accumulation, and class exploitation—but
with the state as the sole capitalist employer.

### Western State Capitalism

During crises, traditional capitalist states also move toward state
capitalism. Examples include:

- War economies during World War I and II
- Nazi Germany's integration of state and big business
- Post-war nationalization in Western Europe
- Modern "state capitalism with Chinese characteristics"[^9]
- Corporate bailouts and state intervention during economic crises

### Party-State Capitalism

A variant emerging in contemporary China combines Communist Party
control with private capitalism. The party maintains power over both
state-owned enterprises and nominally private businesses through party
committees, creating what scholars term "party-state capitalism."[^10]
This represents neither socialism nor traditional capitalism, but a
hybrid form of exploitation.

## Criticism

### The Maintenance of Capitalist Relations

State capitalism does not abolish the fundamental capitalist
relationship between exploiters and exploited. As anarchists have
consistently argued, it merely replaces private capitalists with state
bureaucrats while maintaining:

- **Wage slavery**: Workers remain propertyless wage-earners selling
  their labor power
- **Commodity production**: Goods are produced for exchange rather than
  use
- **Surplus value extraction**: The state appropriates value created by
  workers
- **Class division**: Society remains divided between order-givers and
  order-takers
- **Capital accumulation**: The drive to accumulate capital continues,
  now directed by state planners

Murray Bookchin observed: "Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large
part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the
dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a
revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an
organ within the body of bourgeois society."[^11]

### The Impossibility of Workers' Control Through the State

A central anarchist critique is that workers cannot rule through the
state. Unlike capitalists who can maintain their rule through market
mechanisms regardless of the state form, workers must directly manage
production collectively and democratically. The state, by its
hierarchical nature, prevents this direct management.

As Wayne Price argues: "Unlike the capitalists, they cannot rely on any
automatic processes, such as the 'invisible hand' of the market. They
must make conscious decisions about how the economy (and everything
else) is to be managed. They must engage in democratic planning, a
matter of deliberate, conscious, collective, decision-making."[^12]

The state creates a new ruling class of bureaucrats and managers who
claim to represent workers while actually exploiting them. This "red
bourgeoisie" uses Marxist rhetoric to justify its domination, making
state capitalism particularly insidious as it corrupts revolutionary
ideals.

### Prevention of Revolution

State capitalism serves as a counter-revolutionary force by:

- **Co-opting revolutionary movements**: Channeling revolutionary energy
  into building state power rather than abolishing it
- **Creating false consciousness**: Leading workers to identify their
  exploitation as "building socialism"
- **Discrediting socialism**: Allowing capitalists to point to state
  capitalist tyrannies as the "only alternative" to private capitalism
- **Strengthening state power**: Using socialist rhetoric to justify
  unprecedented expansion of state control

As anarchists predicted, movements with Marxist-Leninist leadership
consistently result in state capitalist dictatorships rather than
workers' self-management. The Bolsheviks, Chinese Communists, Cuban
revolutionaries, and others all followed this pattern, transforming
potentially revolutionary situations into new forms of class domination.

### Economic Inefficiency and Stagnation

Despite claims of rational planning, state capitalist economies suffer
from:

- **Bureaucratic inefficiency**: Central planning by disconnected elites
  fails to meet real needs
- **Lack of innovation**: Without worker participation or market
  competition, stagnation results
- **Resource misallocation**: Political priorities override economic
  rationality
- **Corruption**: Bureaucratic control enables systematic corruption
- **Environmental destruction**: State capitalist regimes have horrific
  environmental records

The Soviet Union never fulfilled a single Five Year Plan, relying on
black markets and informal trading to function. Its eventual collapse
demonstrated state capitalism's internal contradictions.

## Contemporary Relevance

State capitalism remains a vital concern for anarchists because:

- **China's model attracts imitators**: Many see Chinese "party-state
  capitalism" as successful development strategy
- **Crisis tendencies in capitalism**: Economic crises push states
  toward greater intervention
- **Authoritarian movements globally**: Rising authoritarianism often
  adopts state capitalist elements
- **False alternatives**: Democratic socialists and Marxist-Leninists
  still propose state-based "solutions"

The anarchist alternative remains consistent: genuine socialism requires
abolishing both capitalism and the state through direct action, mutual
aid, and building self-managed alternatives. Only through federation of
autonomous communes and workers' councils—not through state power—can
the working class achieve liberation.
