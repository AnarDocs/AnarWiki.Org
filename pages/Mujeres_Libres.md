women's organisation that existed in
<a href="Spain.md" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a> from 1936 to

group in Madrid, it rapidly grew to a national federation of 30,000
members at its height in the summer of 1938.[^1]

The organisation emerged from the
<a href="Anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish anarcho-syndicalist movement">Spanish anarcho-syndicalist
movement</a>, composed of three main organisations: the
<a href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="CNT">CNT</a> union, the
<a href="Federación_Anarquista_Ibérica.md" class="wikilink"
title="FAI">FAI</a> federation, and the
<a href="Federación_Ibérica_de_Juventudes_Libertarias.md" class="wikilink"
title="FIJL">FIJL</a> youth wing. Many women who participated in these
groups felt that their issues were being ignored by the predominantly
male anarchists. As a result, the autonomous Mujeres Libres groups were
created, pursuing both women's liberation and the anarchist social
revolution in parallel, arguing that the two objectives were equally
important and inseparable.[^2]

While Mujeres Libres sought recognition as the fourth main organisation
within the anarchist movement, they never formally achieved equal status
to the other branches. Founded in the
<a href="Second_Spanish_Republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, the group
followed the anarchists in supporting the Republican faction when the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"

the opposing Nationalist forces in 1939, Mujeres Libres collapsed, and
the anarchist movement as a whole was outlawed.

## History

### Origins

The position of women in Spain before 1936 was characterised by extreme
inequality. In employment, women dealt with poor working conditions,
ranging from unhygienic workplaces to consistently lower pay than men
for the same work.[^3] The literacy rate across Spain in this period was
low for both men and women, but consistently lower for women. The female
illiteracy rate in 1930 reached as high as 60% in the southern parts of
Spain, and as high as 30% in the Basque region.[^4] This limited the
political involvement and social mobility of working-class women.

Women were also largely confined to the domestic sphere. Typically,
women had the primary responsibility for raising children, restricting
them in ways men did not experience. Where women were employed, they
usually worked in the home, doing either domestic work or piecework in
industries such as textiles.[^5] The average daily wage of a male
agricultural labourer was 3 pesetas, while a woman received only half
this amount for working from dawn to dusk.[^6]

Within the anarchist movement itself, despite nominal commitment to
equality, numerous shortcomings existed with respect to this goal. The
unequal nature of Spanish society meant that women constituted a
minority in most workplaces, stifling the capacity of women to
participate in the CNT. Even where women represented a majority, the
anarchist trade unions made little effort to organise women, perceiving
them as potential strike-breakers.[^7]

One reason that sexist beliefs remained so prominent was that
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, often
referred to as 'the father of anarchism', had openly believed that women
were inferior, and advocated in his writings that women should remain in
domestic roles even following the anarchist revolution. Even for the
most egalitarian-minded men, it has been commented that "the anarchist
utopia stopped at the front door".[^8] Women attending
<a href="Federación_Ibérica_de_Juventudes_Libertarias.md" class="wikilink"
title="FIJL">FIJL</a> youth groups reported witnessing sexism, with
young men making fun of female speakers and questioning whether women
could accomplish anything through separate organisation.[^9]

### Formation of Mujeres Libres

Following their realisation of the extent of sexism within the CNT in
1933, Lucía Sánchez Saornil and Mercedes Comaposada began discussing the
issue. By 1935, they had begun to form the first Mujeres Libres group in
Madrid.[^10] Together with Dr Amparo Poch y Gascón, the three women are
considered the 'initiators' of the Mujeres Libres movement, an effort to
empower Spanish women.

In 1934, a similar but separate group was founded in Barcelona by CNT
members, including Soledad Estorach, in an effort to involve women in
the anarchist movement. The *Grupo Cultural Feminino* or 'Feminine
Culture Group' was formed, growing into a Catalan regional organisation
entirely independently of Mujeres Libres.[^11] The Barcelona group
wanted to encourage greater activism among women who were already
members of the CNT, whereas the Madrid group wanted to raise
consciousness among women in general.[^12]

When the two groups discovered each other in late 1936, the Barcelona
group decided to affiliate itself with the Madrid group, and renamed
itself *Agrupación Mujeres Libres*. As time went on, numerous other
Mujeres Libres branches formed across the country. They remained
essentially independent of each other in all but name until, in August
1937, 90 local Mujeres Libres groups formally established a national
federation.[^13] As the movement grew, it reached a height of 30,000
members in the summer of 1938.[^14]

### Magazine

From September to November 1935, Lucía Sánchez Saornil and CNT National
Secretary Mariano Rodríguez Vázquez corresponded publicly through the
pages of the anarchist newspaper
*<a href="Solidaridad_Obrera.md" class="wikilink"
title="Solidaridad Obrera">Solidaridad Obrera</a>* regarding the
position of women within the anarchist movement. Sánchez Saornil was
sharply critical of the way in which anarchist women were encouraged
into the movement, arguing that "The vast majority of male comrades...
have minds infected with the most typical bourgeois prejudices".[^15]

Combined with her dissatisfaction with the notion that men were not to
blame for holding onto their privilege by neglecting the cause of women,
this led her to announce her intention to create a full journal devoted
entirely to the cause of women, rather than just one page. The
announcement in April 1936 that this project would go ahead generated
widespread support among anarchists and marked the full emergence of the
Mujeres Libres organisation into the public eye. The first issue of the
*Mujeres Libres* magazine was published on May 20, 1936, and ran for 14
issues.[^16]

Initially the journal did not identify itself as anarchist, though all
the articles were clearly libertarian, as organisers feared alienating
women. However, after the revolution it aligned itself with the CNT. The
magazine carried a variety of content: political commentaries, articles
on cultural themes such as education and sport, reports from women on
the reality of their work conditions, consciousness-raising pieces about
exceptional women, and even articles that would have been seen in any
women's magazine, on topics like childcare and fashion.[^17] The journal
was distributed and advertised via existing anarchist networks.

### During the Spanish Revolution

When the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a> began in July 1936,
women played a full part in the revolutionary response to the military
uprising. Women were present everywhere - on committees, in the
militias, and in the front lines. In the early battles of the civil war,
women fought alongside men as a matter of course.[^18] Women were
involved in building barricades, often with the help of children and
sometimes under fire. A women's battalion fought before Segovia Bridge
in Madrid, and at Gestafe, women were under fire all morning and were
among the last to leave.[^19]

Women were necessarily and naturally involved in the developing social
revolution, in the collectives which established themselves in town and
countryside. By the end of September 1936, Mujeres Libres had seven
Labour Sections: Transport, Public Services, Nursing, Clothing, Mobile
Brigades for non-specialists, and brigades able to substitute for men
needed in the war.[^20]

The organisation produced propaganda through radio, travelling
libraries, and propaganda tours, in order to promote their cause.
Organisers and activists travelled through rural parts of Spain to set
up rural collectives and support women in the country, encouraging women
to become anarchist and participate in both Mujeres Libres and the CNT.
As one activist, Pepita Carpena, described her propaganda tours:

"We would call the women together and explain to them... that there is a
clearly defined role for women, that women should not lose their
independence, but that a woman can be a mother and a companera at the
same time... Young women would come over to me and say 'This is very
interesting. What you're saying we've never heard before. It's something
that we've felt, but we didn't know'... The ideas that grabbed them the
most? Talk about the power men exercised over women... There would be a
kind of uproar when you would say to them, 'We cannot permit men to
think themselves superior to women, that they have a right to rule over
them'. I think that Spanish women were waiting anxiously for that
call."[^21]

Mujeres Libres often collaborated with the anarchist humanitarian
organisation
<a href="Solidaridad_Internacional_Antifascista.md" class="wikilink"
title="Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista">Solidaridad Internacional
Antifascista</a>, of which Lucía Sánchez Saornil was general secretary.
They provided assistance to refugees and wounded soldiers during the
Civil War.[^22]

### Militarisation and Decline

By November 1936, the number of militia women in the front lines had
decreased significantly. Women were increasingly found in auxiliary
roles as orderlies, cooking and washing behind the lines. The government
ordered women away from the frontline when the militias were
"militarised" in November 1936.[^23] This reflected a broader shift as
the initial revolutionary impetus slowed and the forces on the
Republican side geared themselves to the task of winning the war.

As "dual power" gave way to the Popular Front government's consolidation
and extension of control, the informal leadership of the CNT-FAI decided
to enter the government. With more or less heart-searching and
rationalisation, they participated in the legalising, take-over and
eventual suppression of the revolutionary gains.[^24]
<a href="Federica_Montseny.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federica Montseny">Federica Montseny</a>, after some hesitation,
accepted the appointment of Minister of Health.

The situation deteriorated further with the Barcelona May Days of 1937,
when an attack on the Telephone Exchange by government forces intent on
"disarming the rearguard" provoked fierce resistance. The CNT-FAI
leaders were called in to cool the situation, and Federica Montseny was
sent on behalf of the Valencia Government. The net result was confusion,
demoralisation, and concessions from the CNT side.[^25]

### End of the Movement

Following the fall of Catalonia in February 1939, many Republican
figures including Lucía Sánchez Saornil fled to France, and Mujeres
Libres collapsed. The fourteenth issue of the *Mujeres Libres* magazine
was still being printed when Barcelona fell, and no copies survived.
Just two months later, the Spanish Republic fell to Franco's Nationalist
forces, and the resultant Francoist dictatorship suppressed the
anarchist movement.

Nevertheless, participation in the movement had a profound effect on its
members. Historian Martha Ackelsberg noted that their experiences of
"energy, enthusiasm, and sense of personal and collective empowerment"
had a "dramatic and long-lasting impact" on women who had been members,
even half a century after the Civil War.[^26]

## Organisation

Mujeres Libres developed as a national federation with local, regional,
and national committees under the direction of Lucía Sánchez Saornil in
Madrid. At their national conference, held in Valencia in August 1937,
it was announced that there were already 43 branches in Catalonia, 20 in
Aragon, 25 in Guadalajara, 15 in the Levant, and others in Castile and
Andalucia.[^27]

Although nominally directed from Madrid, Mujeres Libres was a federal,
decentralised organisation which entered into local alliances with other
anarchist groups. The organisation maintained strict autonomy from the
male-dominated CNT, FAI, and FIJL, believing this was necessary to fully
address women's issues and allow them to act independently towards
organising and empowering women.[^28]

### Strategy and Activities

Mujeres Libres had a two-pronged strategy of *capacitación*
(preparing/empowerment) and *captación*
(incorporation/participation).[^29] Their activities were wide-ranging
and impressive in scope:

**Education:** Intent on dealing with illiteracy, they set up schools to
teach working-class women to read and transition into the workforce. In
Barcelona they established the Casa de la Dona, a major women's college,
in 1937. By December 1938, the Casa was taking in 600-800 women per
day.[^30] Their educational programmes ranged from simple literacy and
elementary education to technical and professional schools, even
offering training in highly specialised topics such as advanced
viticulture. They also taught 'social formation' through education in
union organisation, sociology, economics, and cultural studies.[^31]

**Workplace and Employment:** Viewing women's participation in economic
activity as a core part of their emancipation, they formed 'labour
sections' to help encourage women into work. They supplied food both to
militias and to urban communities, including the creation of communal
kitchens, and they helped unionise the 15,000 women working in food
services and public transport in Madrid and Barcelona.[^32] They
co-operated with unions in running numerous employment and
apprenticeship programmes to facilitate women's entry to the workplace.

**Military Training:** Mujeres Libres organised support for the
inclusion and training of women soldiers, setting up shooting ranges and
target practice classes and promoting their stories through the
magazine.[^33]

**Health and Social Care:** They set up a school to train nurses and
created an emergency medical clinic to support those who were injured in
the war. Dr Amparo Poch y Gascón used her expertise to teach advanced
first aid and trained women as midwives.[^34] In Barcelona, they ran a
lying-in hospital which provided birth and post-natal care for mothers,
and offered education for all women regarding child and maternal health,
sexuality, and eugenics. This was bolstered by their February 1938
founding of the
<a href="Louise_Michel.md" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
Michel</a> Institute of Maternal and Child Care, offering extensive
medical services and counselling for mothers and children.[^35]

**Childcare:** Mujeres Libres set up childcare centres in both
industrial and agricultural workplaces. As women were the primary carers
of children, this service allowed women to more freely participate in
the workforce and union activities.[^36]

## Philosophy

As participants in the anarcho-syndicalist movement, Mujeres Libres
believed in the abolition of the state and of capitalism. However,
following their negative experiences within male-dominated anarchist
groups, the anarchist women who founded Mujeres Libres began to reject
the idea that the struggle for gender equality was subordinate to the
wider class struggle for economic equality.

This was reflected in their statement of purpose, which argued that
women should be emancipated from their "triple enslavement" - to their
own ignorance, to gender inequality, and to capitalism.[^37] The
reference to 'ignorance' stemmed from a belief that women had an
additional 'internal' struggle to overcome - women had to respect
themselves in order to gain respect from and achieve equality with men.

### Rejection of Feminism

While Mujeres Libres believed that men and women were equal, they
rejected the label of feminism. Instead, they typically referred to
their ideology as 'humanism'. This was because they believed that gender
inequality could not be solved separately from economic inequality. As
one member stated:

"We are not - and were not then feminists. We were not fighting against
men. We did not want to substitute a feminist hierarchy for a masculine
one. It's necessary to work, to struggle, together because if we don't
we'll never have a social revolution. But we needed our own organisation
to struggle for ourselves."[^38]

They were aware of the precedents set by both feminist organisations and
by political parties, but could not follow either path. They could not
separate the women's problem from the social problem, nor could they
deny the significance of the former by converting women into a simple
instrument for any organisation. They rejected mainstream feminism whose
only ambition was "to give to women of a particular class the
opportunity to participate more fully in the existing system of
privilege".[^39]

For example, they believed that prostitution was a form of exploitation
of women that arose partially due to the desperate circumstances of
poverty; as a result, their attempts to eradicate the practice focused
on creating women's shelters and training programmes rather than banning
the practice.[^40]

### Autonomy

Compared to other leftist women's organisations in Spain at the time,
Mujeres Libres was unique in that it insisted on remaining autonomous
from its sister organisations, the male-dominated CNT, FAI, and FIJL.
They did so in order to fully address women's issues, arguing that
autonomy and separation would allow them to act independently towards
organising and empowering women - goals which they saw other anarchist
groups as having neglected.[^41]

They insisted they were an integral part of the libertarian movement,
but chose not to request voting delegates at meetings of the three other
organisations in order to preserve their autonomy. Mujeres Libres wished
to participate in the movement, but did not wish to be bound by its
resolutions and thus lose independence.[^42]

As one organisational statement argued: "Mujeres Libres could have
converted itself into an appendage of the union movement with respect to
feminine preparation, transforming women into a receptacle of
anarcho-syndicalism. It could have converted itself into an annex of a
'Women's Section' of the FAI... but it didn't do this either. Since
those of us who were its 'prime movers' were anarchists, we could not
accede to a situation in which, within this specific organisation, there
would be individuals without a social formation: nor could we as
anarchists, convert those individuals into blind instruments without
contradicting our own anarchist principles."[^43]

### Mujeres Libres Anthem

The Mujeres Libres Anthem, written by Lucía Sánchez Saornil in 1937,
expressed their revolutionary aspirations:

*Fists upraised, women of Iberia* *towards horizons pregnant with light*
*on paths afire* *feet on the ground* *face to the blue sky.*

*Affirming the promise of life* *let's defy tradition* *we mold the warm
clay* *of a new world born of pain.*

*Let the past vanish into nothingness!* *What do we care for yesterday!*
*We want to write anew* *the word WOMAN.*

*Fists upraised, women of the world* *towards horizons pregnant with
light* *on paths afire* *onward, onward* *toward the light.*[^44]

## Criticism

### Opposition Within the Anarchist Movement

Following Proudhon's patriarchal views, some anarchist opponents of the
movement towards women's rights in Spain argued that a woman's proper
role was to be a mother and to offer support to their activist husbands
in the home, rather than to participate directly in the movement
themselves. The women of Mujeres Libres were also often disrespectfully
referred to as 'Mujeres Liebres' (literally "women hares"), implying
that they 'hopped' from bed to bed - a clear attempt to sexually degrade
members of the movement.[^45]

As the anarchist organisations were strong advocates of
decentralisation, policies on cooperation with Mujeres Libres varied
between the local, regional, and national levels. Local groups tended to
be more amenable towards collaboration, enabling Mujeres Libres to
undertake many of its projects jointly with local unions. In contrast,
at the regional and national levels, they found much more resistance.
While they were granted funding to continue their operation, it was
often much less than what was requested. The FIJL even set up a Women's
Bureau within its own organisation, which competed with Mujeres Libres,
despite their common position that women did not need a separate
organisation.[^46]

One key reason for this hostility - and the eventual denial of equal
status at the October 1938 national movement congress - was the
insistence of Mujeres Libres on autonomy. Their independent goals of
empowering women, rather than just incorporating them into the movement,
were seen as calling into question the capability of existing
organisations. The main objections to Mujeres Libres seemed to be:

1.  That anarchism admitted of no difference by sex and therefore that
    an organisation oriented only to women could not be truly a
    libertarian organisation
2.  That Mujeres Libres was causing confusion because it was engaging in
    work done by the unions
3.  That Mujeres Libres should not be functioning as an autonomous
    organisation but should be operating within the unions and cultural
    centres[^47]

In response, Mujeres Libres argued: "Our self-determination cannot be
opposed on grounds that Anarchism doesn't admit of sex differences,
because then it would be necessary to conclude that, as of now, our
Libertarian Organisations are not deserving of that name, because
whether by choice or by necessity, its militants are almost exclusively
men!"[^48]

The accusation of separatism was commonly levied at Mujeres Libres -
despite their constant affirmation that they sought no such end, and
their belief that women's emancipation and anarchist revolution were
intrinsically linked.[^49]

At the Libertarian Movement Congress in October 1938, Mujeres Libres
delegates made a dangerous journey to Barcelona, only to find they were
not allowed full access to the meeting. The congress floor only allowed
Mujeres Libres into discussions that primarily affected them. When they
tried to get official recognition, this was never put to the vote, as
delegates argued that this had not been on the pre-conference agenda.
Instead, a motion offering solidarity and support to Mujeres Libres was
passed.[^50]

As one delegate, Pura Perez Arcos, reported: "We were tremendously
excited and ready to argue the case for Mujeres Libres on the floor of
the congress. But they would not even allow us into the meeting."[^51]

The first time that Mujeres Libres were to be called to a libertarian
meeting as an equal member of the libertarian family was on the very day
of the evacuation of Barcelona, January 24, 1939, when the fascists were
practically at the gates. By then it was too late.[^52]

### Relations with Other Women's Organisations

Relations between Mujeres Libres and other women's groups were often
tense. One reason for this was their rejection of feminism, due to their
belief that women's activism should only take place alongside anarchist
organising. During the Civil War, within the Republic, ideological
tensions between various factions were extremely prominent. The
Communist Party had set up women's organisations, particularly the
PCE-led <a href="Asociación_de_Mujeres_Antifascistas.md" class="wikilink"
title="Association of Antifascist Women">Association of Antifascist
Women</a> (AMA).[^53]

In the name of anti-fascist unity, the AMA called for the unification of
women's groups into one organisation dedicated to mobilising women for
the war effort. <a href="Dolores_Ibárruri.md" class="wikilink"
title="Dolores Ibárruri">Dolores Ibárruri</a>, a prominent female
Communist figure and leader of the AMA, contested that women should be
organised and encouraged into the workforce, but focused on the war
effort rather than women's emancipation.[^54]

Mujeres Libres rejected this call, not only due to their ideological
opposition to the PCE, but also because they viewed wartime contribution
as only one part of a broader programme of women's emancipation. In this
way, Mujeres Libres was unique among contemporary women's organisations
in that it considered women's emancipation an end in itself.

### Contemporary Analysis

Modern anarchist scholars have offered mixed assessments of Mujeres
Libres' achievements. Historian Temma Kaplan argued that "There is no
reason to believe that the condition of Spanish women would have been
fundamentally changed if the anarchists had won the war," noting that
anarchists did not develop a programme to prevent similar exploitation
in revolutionary society.[^55]

However, this analysis has been contested by those who point to the
tremendous practical achievements of the organisation under extremely
difficult wartime conditions, and who argue that the liberation of women
was intrinsically linked to the fate of the overall revolution. As one
contemporary analysis put it: "The fate of women in revolution is
closely connected with the fate of the revolution as a whole. In Spain,
there were initial gains, even if partial, limited and fragmented;
stabilisation set in with the wartime situation, to be followed by
reverses; defeat brought reaction."[^56]

Women anarchists were convinced that their liberation had to await the
end of the war - that while the authority of the capitalist over his
worker, and of the landlord over his tenant could be challenged, that of
man over woman could not be attacked until military victory was assured.
Most were persuaded that after the war was over, after the revolution
had triumphed, the lives of Spanish women would be transformed. This
subordination of women's specific demands to the war effort has been
criticised as a tactical error that weakened both the women's cause and
the revolution itself.[^57]

## Legacy

The experience of Mujeres Libres has had lasting significance for
anarchist and feminist movements. Despite its short existence and the
defeat of the Spanish Revolution, the organisation demonstrated the
possibility of combining women's liberation with broader social
revolution, rejecting both bourgeois feminism and the subordination of
women's issues to "more important" revolutionary goals.

The organisation's insistence on autonomy while maintaining connection
to the broader movement, its two-pronged strategy of empowerment and
incorporation, and its practical achievements in education, workplace
organising, and social services have provided important lessons for
subsequent anarcha-feminist organising.

As historian David Porter noted: "The issues articulated and explored by
Mujeres Libres in the 1930s have been accepted for years as appropriate
approaches in our own context by many in the larger feminist movement.
These include movement strategies such as grassroots communication
outside the workplace, personal consciousness-raising, and autonomous
communities of orientation in the process of consciousness change."[^58]

The lessons of Mujeres Libres remain particularly relevant for
contemporary movements. As one analysis concluded: "How relevant for us
than the question of what might have happened if..., is the question of
what happens now. There are some grounds for calculated optimism... At
least there are some things our male comrades could not now get away
with, and, it is to be hoped, would not wish to impose. And - again
hopefully - we have the beginnings of a libertarian movement which can
expect to have credibility and to develop towards a new vision of
society only if the liberation of women is an integral part of its
perspectives."[^59]

### In Popular Culture

The 1996 historical drama film *Libertarias*, directed by Vicente
Aranda, is centred on members of Mujeres Libres.
