> The differences between two Zapotec communities illustrates that peace
> is a choice. The Zapotec are a sedentary agrarian indigenous nation
> living on land that is now claimed by the state of Mexico. One Zapotec
> community, La Paz, has a yearly homicide rate of 3.4/100,000. A
> neighboring Zapotec community has the much higher homicide rate of
> 18.1/100,000. What social attributes go along with the more peaceful
> way of life? Unlike their more violent neighbors, the La Paz Zapotec
> do not beat children; accordingly, children see less violence and use
> less violence in their play. Similarly, wife-beating is rare and not
> considered acceptable; women are considered equal to men, and enjoy an
> autonomous economic activity that is important to the life of the
> community so they are not dependent on men. Regarding child-rearing,
> the implications of this particular comparison are corroborated by at
> least one cross-cultural study on socialization, which found that
> warm, affectionate socialization techniques correlate with low levels
> of conflict in society.[^2]
