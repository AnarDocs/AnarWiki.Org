From Harold Barclay, People Without Government [^1]:

> Of the Californians let us briefly consider the Yurok. They were
> fishermen and seed (acorn) gatherers as well as hunters. The Yurok
> constitute small rather permanent communities composed of
> patrilineally related families centred around a senior male - 'the
> rich man'. The 'rich man' office is essentially the senior rank in the
> community. Its holder is overseer of the group's wealth. He directs
> activities at salmon weirs and on acorn grounds and could draw upon
> the wealth of the community to pay bride wealth or blood money. He
> maintains his position through his 'influence' and displays
> characteristics deemed proper for a Yurok man of prestige,
> particularly through demonstrations of his great generosity and,
> hence, wealth. Any decisions he might make could only be enforced by
> withholding his generosity or threatening to do so. Obviously, he
> could do greater favours for those whom he saw as the most obedient
> and loyal.
>
> The Yurok possess an elaborate set of regulations concerning offences,
> but the technique employed to enforce these rules is not one of law
> enforcement, but rather one of mediation. Disputants in a case choose
> 'go betweens' or 'crosses' who cross back and forth between the
> conflicting sides carrying offers and counter offers until an
> agreement is reached. The go-betweens are expected to be completely
> impartial and to bring forth an agreement which is fair to both sides.
> They gather the evidence and make a judgment about damages on the
> basis of a scale which forms part of Yurok traditional regulations.
> Individuals judged as offenders by the go-betweens are expected to pay
> fines in accord with these regulations. Thus a man's life is valued as
> equal to the bride wealth paid for his mother.
>
> Hoebel considers that these circumstances constitute a court of law
> (196 1 , 25). However, Kroeber clearly indicates that the opposing
> parties involved have to agree to the decision of the crosses (1953).
> They are therefore not judges with the power to compel obedience by
> force. They are negotiators with the moral backing of society. This is
> a kind of non-governmental system of dispute settlement which one
> finds widely dispersed throughout the world and one which we will
> encounter again in the descriptions to follow. That it is so common
> and widespread may indicate that it has proven a most successful
> mechanism for maintaining peace. It should be noted that the main aim
> of this form of justice is not to assess guilt and gloat over rights
> and wrongs, but rather it is to re-establish communal peace and group
> harmony.
>
> Yurok depend upon other important devices such as gossip and sometimes
> 'rash youths' attempt to form a kind of vigilante committee to settle
> disputes, thus transforming a minor issue into a major conflict and
> possibly a blood feud.
