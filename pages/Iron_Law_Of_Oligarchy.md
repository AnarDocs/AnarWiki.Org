# Iron Law of Oligarchy

The **iron law of oligarchy** is a
<a href="Political_philosophy" class="wikilink"
title="political theory">political theory</a> first developed by the
German-born Italian
<a href="sociology" class="wikilink" title="sociologist">sociologist</a>
<a href="Robert_Michels" class="wikilink" title="Robert Michels">Robert
Michels</a> in his 1911 book
*<a href="Political_Parties_(book)" class="wikilink"
title="Political Parties">Political Parties</a>*.[^1] It asserts that
rule by an elite, or
<a href="oligarchy" class="wikilink" title="oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, is
inevitable as an "iron law" within any
<a href="Democracy" class="wikilink" title="democratic">democratic</a>
organization as part of the "tactical and technical necessities" of the
organization. The theory is often used as one of the strongest arguments
against democracy, especially
<a href="Representative_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a>.

Michels' theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how
democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies.
Michels observed that since no sufficiently large and complex
organization can function purely as a
<a href="direct_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a>,
<a href="Power_(social_and_political)" class="wikilink"
title="power">power</a> within an organization will always get delegated
to individuals within that group, elected or otherwise. As he put it in
*Political Parties*, "It is organization which gives dominion of the
elected over the electors. \[...\] Who says organization, says
oligarchy."[^2]

According to Michels, all organizations eventually come to be run by a
leadership class who often function as paid
<a href="Administrator_of_the_government" class="wikilink"
title="administrator">administrators</a>,
<a href="Executive_(government)" class="wikilink"
title="executive">executives</a>,
<a href="spokesperson" class="wikilink"
title="spokesperson">spokespersons</a>, or
<a href="Political_consulting" class="wikilink"
title="political strategist">political strategists</a> for the
organization. Far from being servants of the masses, Michels argues,
this leadership class, rather than the organization's membership, will
inevitably grow to dominate the organization's
<a href="power_structure" class="wikilink" title="power structure">power
structures</a>.[^3]

By controlling who has access to information, those in power can
<a href="Centralized_government" class="wikilink"
title="centralize">centralize</a> their power, often with little
accountability, due to the
<a href="Voter_apathy" class="wikilink" title="apathy">apathy</a>,
<a href="Political_alienation" class="wikilink"
title="indifference">indifference</a>, and non-participation most
rank-and-file members have in relation to their organization's
decision-making processes. Democratic attempts to hold leadership
positions <a href="accountability" class="wikilink"
title="accountable">accountable</a> are prone to fail, since with power
comes the ability to reward
<a href="loyalty" class="wikilink" title="loyalty">loyalty</a>, the
ability to control information about the organization, and the ability
to control what procedures the organization follows when making
decisions.

All of these mechanisms can be used to strongly influence the outcome of
any decisions made "democratically" by members.[^4] In 1911, using
<a href="anecdote" class="wikilink" title="anecdote">anecdotes</a> from
the histories of <a href="Political_party" class="wikilink"
title="political parties">political parties</a> and
<a href="trade_union" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
unions</a> struggling to operate democratically, Michels applied his
argument to <a href="representative_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a> at large.
He believed that "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic
measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy."[^5]

## History

In 1911, Robert Michels argued that the socialist parties of Europe,
despite their democratic ideology and provisions for mass participation,
seemed to be dominated by their leaders just like traditional
<a href="Conservatism" class="wikilink"
title="conservative">conservative</a> parties. Michels' conclusion was
that the problem lay in the nature of organizations. The more
<a href="Liberalism" class="wikilink" title="liberal">liberal</a> and
democratic modern era allowed the formation of organizations with novel
and revolutionary goals, but as such organizations become more complex,
they became less and less democratic and revolutionary. Michels
formulated the "iron law of oligarchy": "Who says organization, says
oligarchy."

Michels himself was originally a <a href="Syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="Syndicalist">Syndicalist</a>, but he later became an important
ideologue of <a href="Benito_Mussolini" class="wikilink"
title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s
<a href="fascism" class="wikilink" title="fascist">fascist</a> regime in
Italy, teaching economics at the
<a href="University_of_Perugia" class="wikilink"
title="University of Perugia">University of Perugia</a>.[^6][^7]

## Reasons

"Organization implies the tendency to oligarchy. In every organization,
whether it be a political party, a professional union, or any other
association of the kind, the aristocratic tendency manifests itself very
clearly. The mechanism of the organization, while conferring a solidity
of structure, induces serious changes in the organized mass, completely
inverting the respective position of the leaders and the led. As a
result of organization, every party of professional union becomes
divided into a minority of directors and a majority of directed." —
Robert Michels[^8]

Michels stressed several factors that underlie the iron law of
oligarchy. Darcy K. Leach summarized them briefly as: "Bureaucracy
happens. If bureaucracy happens, power rises. Power corrupts." Any large
organization, Michels pointed out, has to create a
<a href="bureaucracy" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> to maintain its efficiency as it
becomes larger—many decisions have to be made daily that cannot be made
by large numbers of disorganized people. For the organization to
function, centralization has to occur and power will end up in the hands
of a few. Those few—the oligarchy—will use all means necessary to
preserve and further increase their power.

According to Michels, this process is further compounded as delegation
is necessary in any large organization, as thousands—sometimes hundreds
of thousands—of members cannot make decisions via
<a href="participatory_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="participatory democracy">participatory democracy</a>. This has to
date been dictated by the lack of <a href="technology" class="wikilink"
title="technological means">technological means</a> for large numbers of
people to meet and debate, and also by matters related to
<a href="crowd_psychology" class="wikilink"
title="crowd psychology">crowd psychology</a>, as Michels argued that
people feel a need to be led. Delegation leads to specialization—to the
development of knowledge bases, skills and resources among a
leadership—which further alienates the leadership from the rank and file
and entrenches the leadership in office. Michels also argued that for
leaders in organizations, "The desire to dominate \[...\] is universal.
These are elementary psychological facts." Thus, they were prone to seek
power and dominance.[^9]

Bureaucratization and <a href="Departmentalization" class="wikilink"
title="specialization">specialization</a> are the driving processes
behind the iron law. They result in the rise of a group of professional
administrators in a <a href="hierarchical_organization" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical organization">hierarchical organization</a>, which
in turn leads to the
<a href="Rationalization_(sociology)" class="wikilink"
title="rationalization">rationalization</a> and
<a href="Routinization_of_charisma" class="wikilink"
title="routinization">routinization</a> of
<a href="authority" class="wikilink" title="authority">authority</a> and
<a href="decision-making" class="wikilink"
title="decision-making">decision-making</a>, a process described first
and perhaps best by
<a href="Max_Weber" class="wikilink" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>,
later by <a href="John_Kenneth_Galbraith" class="wikilink"
title="John Kenneth Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, and to a
lesser and more cynical extent by the
<a href="Peter_principle" class="wikilink" title="Peter principle">Peter
principle</a>. Bureaucracy, by design, leads to centralization of power
by the leaders. Leaders also have control over sanctions and rewards.
They tend to promote those who share their opinions, which inevitably
leads to self-perpetuation. People achieve leadership positions because
they have above-average political skill (see
<a href="Charismatic_authority" class="wikilink"
title="Charismatic authority">Charismatic authority</a>). As they
advance in their careers, their power and prestige increases. Leaders
control the information that flows down the channels of communication,
censoring what they do not want the rank-and-file to know. Leaders will
also dedicate significant resources to persuade the rank-and-file of the
rightness of their views. This is compatible with most societies: people
are taught to obey those in positions of authority. The rank and file
show little initiative, and wait for the leaders to exercise their
judgement and issue directives to follow.

## Implications

The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization,
regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually
and inevitably develop
<a href="oligarchy" class="wikilink" title="oligarchic">oligarchic</a>
tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically
impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations. The
relative structural fluidity in a small-scale democracy succumbs to
"social viscosity" in a large-scale organization. According to the "iron
law", democracy and large-scale organization are incompatible.

## Evidence

### Political Parties

An example that Michels used in his book was Germany's
<a href="Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany" class="wikilink"
title="Social Democratic Party">Social Democratic Party</a>. Other
well-studied examples include the German Green Party.

### Labour Unions and Lipset's Union Democracy

One of the best known exceptions to the iron law of oligarchy is the now
defunct <a href="International_Typographical_Union" class="wikilink"
title="International Typographical Union">International Typographical
Union</a>, described by <a href="Seymour_Martin_Lipset" class="wikilink"
title="Seymour Martin Lipset">Seymour Martin Lipset</a> in his 1956
book,
*<a href="Union_Democracy" class="wikilink" title="Union Democracy">Union
Democracy</a>*.[^10] Lipset suggests a number of factors that existed in
the ITU that are supposedly responsible for countering this tendency
toward bureaucratic oligarchy. The first and perhaps most important has
to do with the way the union was founded. Unlike many other unions
(e.g., the
<a href="Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations" class="wikilink"
title="CIO">CIO</a>'s
<a href="United_Steel_Workers_of_America" class="wikilink"
title="United Steel Workers of America">United Steel Workers of
America</a> (USWA), and numerous other craft unions) which were
organized from the top down, the ITU had a number of large, strong,
local unions who valued their
<a href="autonomy" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>, which
existed long before the international was formed. This local autonomy
was strengthened by the economy of the printing industry which operated
in largely local and regional markets, with little competition from
other geographical areas. Large locals continued to jealously guard this
autonomy against encroachments by international officers. Second, the
existence of factions helped place a check on the oligarchic tendencies
that existed at the national headquarters. Leaders that are unchecked
tend to develop larger salaries and more sumptuous lifestyles, making
them unwilling to go back to their previous jobs. But with a powerful
out faction ready to expose profligacy, no leaders dared take overly
generous personal remuneration. These two factors were compelling in the
ITU case.

Lipset and his collaborators also cite a number of other factors which
are specific to craft unions in general and the printing crafts in
particular, including the homogeneity of the membership, with respect to
their work and lifestyles, their identification with their craft, their
more middle class lifestyle and pay. For this latter point he draws upon
<a href="Aristotle" class="wikilink" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> who
argued that a democratic polity was most likely where there was a large,
stable middle class, and the extremes of wealth and poverty were not
great. Finally, the authors note the irregular work hours which led
shopmates to spend more of their leisure time together. These latter
factors are less persuasive, since they do not apply to many industrial
forms of organization, where the greatest amount of trade union
democracy has developed in recent times.

### Participatory Subgroups and Countervailing Power

Jonathan Fox's 1992 study of Mexican peasant organizations focuses on
how participatory subgroups within a membership organization can
generate a degree of countervailing power that can at least temporarily
mitigate the "iron law of oligarchy."[^11]

### Wikipedia

Research by Piotr Konieczny from 2009, a case study of the evolution of
Wikipedia's policy on verifiability, argued that Wikipedia is not
significantly affected by the iron law.[^12] A 2016 study by Bradi
Heaberlin and Simon DeDeo has found that the evolution of
<a href="Wikipedia" class="wikilink" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s
network of norms over time is consistent with the iron law of oligarchy.
Their quantitative analysis is based on data-mining over a decade of
article and user information. It shows the emergence of an oligarchy
derived from competencies in five significant "clusters",
administration, article quality, collaboration, formatting, and content
policy. Heaberlin and DeDeo note "The encyclopedia's core norms address
universal principles, such as neutrality, verifiability, civility, and
consensus. The ambiguity and interpretability of these abstract concepts
may drive them to decouple from each other over time."[^13] This view
conflicts with the view proposed by
<a href="Anarchy_Works" class="wikilink" title="some">some</a> that
Wikipedia is democratic and self-improving, but the lack of formal
hierarchies in Wikipedia and commitment to certain ideals prevent a
fixed hierarchy and keeps Wikipedia open-source.

## Breaking the Iron Law

It is possible to break the law and preserve democratic institutions
from becoming oligarchical.

### Adolf Gasser's Proposed Solution

In his book *Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas*, published in 1943
(first edition in German) with a second edition in 1947 (in German),
<a href="Adolf_Gasser" class="wikilink" title="Adolf Gasser">Adolf
Gasser</a> stated the following requirements for a representative
democracy to remain stable, unaffected by Michels' iron law of
oligarchy:

- Society has to be built up from bottom to top. As a consequence,
  society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to
  defend themselves with weapons.
- These free people join or form local communities. These local
  communities are independent, which includes financial independence,
  and they are free to determine their own rules.
- Local communities join into a higher unit e.g. a canton.
- There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.
- There is competition between these local communities e.g. on services
  delivered or on taxes.

This approach strongly resembles the model of confederation proposed by
anarchists.

## Reception

In 1954, <a href="Maurice_Duverger" class="wikilink"
title="Maurice Duverger">Maurice Duverger</a> expressed general
agreement with Michels's thesis. In a 1953 study, C. W. Cassinelli
argued that Michels's main thesis has "a high degree of general
credibility", but argued that the statement of the theory was
"inadequate" and that Michels's evidence for the theory was
"inconclusive".[^14] In a 1966 article, political scientist
<a href="Dankwart_Rustow" class="wikilink"
title="Dankwart Rustow">Dankwart Rustow</a> described Michels's thesis
as "a brilliantly fallacious argument a fortiori".[^15] Rustow stated
that the experience of the social democratic parties of Europe could not
be generalized for other political parties.
<a href="Josiah_Ober" class="wikilink" title="Josiah Ober">Josiah
Ober</a> argues in *Democracy and Knowledge* that the experience of
ancient Athens shows Michels's argument does not hold true; Athens was a
large participatory democracy, yet it outperformed its hierarchical
rivals.[^16]

According to a 2000 article, "To the extent that contemporary scholars
ask at all about social movement organizations, they tend to reinforce
Michels's claim that bureaucratized, established organizations are more
conservative in goals and tactics, though usually without explicitly
engaging the iron law debate."[^17] The study however found that the
iron law was malleable, and that established labor unions could under
certain circumstances revitalize and experience radical change in line
with its members' desires.

According to a 2005 study, "Despite almost a century of scholarly debate
on this question... there is still no consensus about whether and under
what conditions Michels's claim holds true."[^18] One criticism is that
power does not necessarily corrupt the leadership of organizations, and
that the structure of organizations can check leaders. Another criticism
is that Michels does not outline the conditions under which his thesis
could be falsified nor a clear definition of what constitutes oligarchy.

The method that Michels uses has sometimes been characterized as a
"crucial" or "least likely" case study, because he chose a case (the
German Social Democratic Party) that is least likely to support his
theory (because the German Social Democratic Party was an institution
that had a democratic process and ideology).[^19][^20]

Michels' thesis became popular once more in the postwar United States
with the publication of *<a
href="Union_Democracy:_The_Internal_Politics_of_the_International_Typographical_Union"
class="wikilink"
title="Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union">Union
Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical
Union</a>* (1956) by Lipset, Trow, and Coleman.

## Relation to Other Works

The iron law of oligarchy is similar to the concept in
*<a href="The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Oligarchical_Collectivism"
class="wikilink"
title="The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism">The Theory
and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism</a>*, a

*<a href="Nineteen_Eighty-Four" class="wikilink"
title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>* (1984) by
<a href="George_Orwell" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">George

Burnham</a>'s book *<a href="The_Managerial_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="The Managerial Revolution">The Managerial Revolution</a>* several
years earlier. That fictional book begins:

"Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the
<a href="Neolithic_Age" class="wikilink" title="Neolithic Age">Neolithic
Age</a>, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High,
the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they
have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as
well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age:
but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after
enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern
has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to
equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other."[^21]
