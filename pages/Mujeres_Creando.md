Mujeres Creando (Women Creating) is an anarcho-indigenist group in
Bolivia, founded in 1992. The following is from Jacqueline Lasky's
"Indigenism, Anarchism, Feminism: An Emerging Framework for Exploring
Post-Imperial Futures:[^1]

> Mujeres Creando is a group of women who self-consciously link
> indigenism, feminism and anarchism in their direct action practices to
> confront the Bolivian state, heteropatriarchy and the neoliberal
> order. Since 1992, they have utilized diversity and creativity in
> their incessant public art, educational workshops, Indymedia
> productions, mass occupation of private banks, various spontaneous and
> planned actions with allies, incisive critiques of the Left and Right,
> insistently visible and vocal non-participation in the electoral
> process, performativity and powerful presences on urban streets that
> are simultaneously disruptive and welcoming (MujeresCreando). In their
> own words:
>
> > Mujeres Creando is made up of lesbians and heterosexuals, whites and
> > indigenous women, young and old women, divorced and married women,
> > women from the country and from the city, etc. The system tries to
> > keep us in the ‘enclosed cubicles’ and to divide us so that it can
> > control us more effectively. … In the process of constructing
> > organization—no bosses, not hierarchy—I speak for myself and don’t
> > represent anybody. I’ve said it \[before\] and I’ll say it again
> > that we’re not anarchists by Bakunin or the CNT, but rather by our
> > grandmothers, and that’s a beautiful school of anarchism. … We’re
> > interested in the daily construction of practice and theory in the
> > streets and in nurturing our creativity (Collective 2002: 111-2).
>
> They are re-creating relations based upon their traditions and their
> preferred futures in the urban landscapes of their lives, while still
> fostering relations with those in the rural countryside and taking
> actions in solidarity. These anarch@indigenists are living differently
> with each other in ways that confront authority figures in their
> lives, such as in the state, church, and family, thereby compelling
> different sociopolitical interactions.
>
> Of particular significance is Mujeres Creando’s critique of Bolivian
> President Evo Morales, the first indigenous head of state. Morales is
> highly regarded by many in Bolivia, Latin America and throughout the
> world for prioritizing the rights of indigenous people in the state,
> for enacting policies that contribute to the needs of indigenous
> farmers, for confronting multinational corporations and renegotiating
> terms of resource use to retain more profit within the country to
> expand social programs, and for many other radically progressive
> actions prior to and since assuming office. In this context, the
> critique levied against Morales by Mujeres Creando is curious:
>
> > In Bolivia there are hundreds of thousands of Evos, in each public
> > high school, on each neighborhood soccer team, in each little
> > workers union, from the taxi drivers to the ice cream vendors. There
> > are intuitive Evos, with beautifully dark complexions, casual and
> > unorthodox in terms of cultural identity. They are Evos as modern as
> > they are indigenous but, above all audacious in their use of words
> > and careless and macho in sex and love. They use ponchos, suits or
> > sports jackets and they choose their clothes with the liberty that
> > patriarchal societies prohibit women, and above all those that are
> > called ‘indigenous’ and who, for that reason, have to carry their
> > cultural identity on their hips and backs, undrawing their curves in
> > the use of masculine mandates (Galindo 2008).
>
> Maria Galindo, in an article posted on the Mujeres Creando website,
> explains that President Morales’s proposed changes to the Bolivian
> Constitution in the form of a constitutional assembly will in effect
> forcefully re-inscribe patriarchal and neoliberal boundaries upon the
> peoples and movements that put him in office in the first place. Among
> other reasons, this is because the assembly will “close all
> possibility of direct representation of social movements,” “ratify the
> technocratic neoliberal criteria of representation of women as a
> biological quota within political parties,” and “leaves out the
> important sectors of ‘neoliberal exiles’ who are a migrant population
> in countries like Argentina, Brazil, U.S. and Spain” (Ibid).
> Furthermore, “in this way, the magical Evo, the Evo who wakes up
> identities, can convert himself into an identitive antidote that
> inaugurates a regime closed around its leaders.” (Ouch!)
>
> Their critique of President Evo Morales is not one of mere differences
> of opinion or public policy; on the contrary, Mujeres Creando
> relentlessly holds him accountable for what he does while taking him
> to task on the means he proposes that effectively undermine the ends
> that he professes. They remind Morales that he is only in this
> position of power because of the masses of peoples in movements, and
> that now he will effectively be muting their voices for the sake of
> structural expediency. In their capacious analysis, Mujeres Creando
> link all of this to the inherent corruptibility of state structures
> and to the inherent oppressiveness of heteropatriarchy that permeates
> societies. Moreover, they shrewdly interrogate the ‘indigenous’
> signification of Morales and its hegemonic potentiality, which Mujeres
> Creando rejects:
>
> > \[L\]ooking at ‘supposedly’ original cultures is not the mechanism
> > that will permit us to decolonize our society, nor make it fuller,
> > more livable or freer. The demand for ‘the original culture’ as
> > pure, as the culture that will build the nation, the project of
> > power and then nationalism will only drive us to the patriarchal and
> > colonial renovation of power, where power simply exercises power
> > with a mere change of character. … Our society is not a society of
> > pure, original, indigenous people versus undesirable mestizo
> > white-oids. It is much more complex than that; ours is a society of
> > disobediences and cultural mutations… It is a society like all
> > societies of the world where we as social actors also construct
> > culture… We are not ‘obedient originals’ and for that reason and
> > because we put in question cultural mandates, starting with clothing
> > and ending with pleasures. Due to and thanks to this disobedience
> > which makes us happy, we propose a decolonizing and
> > depatriarchalizing society project that has the rise of nationalisms
> > as a principle question’ (Ibid).
>
> In other words, they force an interrogation of indigeneity, especially
> when in forms of state power, through the deployment of feminist and
> anarchist sensibilities. In these myriad and hybrid ways, the works of
> Mujeres Creando reflect a praxis of the intersectionality of
> indigenism, anarchism and feminism.
