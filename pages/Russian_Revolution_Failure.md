# The Failures Of The Russian Revolution

## Overview

The <a href="Russian_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917 began as a
genuine popular uprising that overthrew the
<a href="Tsarism" class="wikilink" title="Tsarist">Tsarist</a> autocracy
and created extensive networks of workers' councils
(<a href="soviets" class="wikilink" title="soviets">soviets</a>),
factory committees, and peasant assemblies. However, rather than
establishing
<a href="socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialism">socialism</a> or
<a href="communism" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a>,
the revolution was transformed into a
<a href="Bolshevism" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>
party dictatorship that ultimately created
<a href="state_capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a> and paved the way for
<a href="totalitarianism" class="wikilink"
title="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>.

While this outcome is often attributed solely to external factors such
as civil war, foreign intervention, and economic collapse, examination
of the historical record reveals that Bolshevik ideology and practice
played a decisive role in this transformation. The assault on
<a href="soviet_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="soviet democracy">soviet democracy</a>,
<a href="workers&#39;_control" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a>, and opposition
parties commenced almost immediately after the October seizure of power,
well before the major civil war fighting erupted in May 1918.

## The Bolshevik Counter-Revolution

### Early Authoritarian Measures

The
<a href="Bolsheviks" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>'
authoritarian trajectory began in the revolution's first months, during
what <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>
himself acknowledged was a period of relative peace. In March 1918,
Lenin stated that civil war had been won with extraordinary ease,
describing the Russian revolution as a continuous triumphal march in its
first months.[^1]

During this relatively peaceful period, the Bolsheviks introduced
one-man management in industry, created the
<a href="Supreme_Economic_Council" class="wikilink"
title="Supreme Economic Council">Supreme Economic Council</a> to
centrally plan the economy, and launched attacks on
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
centers. On December 5, 1917, they established the
<a href="Cheka" class="wikilink" title="Cheka">Cheka</a>, the secret
police, which directed activity against other revolutionary currents
from the very beginning.

### Suppression of Soviet Democracy

The first act after seizing power was creating the Council of People's
Commissars
(<a href="Sovnarkom" class="wikilink" title="Sovnarkom">Sovnarkom</a>)
above the soviets, contradicting Lenin's own arguments in
*<a href="The_State_and_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="The State and Revolution">The State and Revolution</a>* about
merging executive and legislative functions. Four days later, the
Sovnarkom unilaterally granted itself legislative power.[^2]

The Central Executive Committee became a rubber stamp, with its
Bolshevik-dominated presidium controlling proceedings and circumventing
general meetings. Local soviets saw power shift to executive committees
and presidia, with plenary sessions becoming increasingly symbolic. When
soviets elected non-Bolshevik majorities in spring 1918, the party
responded with arrests, military dispersal, and gerrymandering.[^3]

The Petrograd Soviet elections demonstrate this pattern. Before the
voting, Bolsheviks changed regulations to ensure their majority through
structural manipulation. They gave decisive representation to agencies
they controlled, limited factory delegates to 260 of 700 positions,
allowed closed factories to elect delegates, and reopened opposition
newspapers only days before voting. The soviet became an assembly of
Bolshevik functionaries rather than a popularly elected body.[^4]

### Destruction of Workers' Control

The Bolsheviks opposed the <a href="factory_committees" class="wikilink"
title="factory committees">factory committees</a>' vision of socialism
from the beginning. While factory committees understood
<a href="workers&#39;_control" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a> as direct management
by workers themselves, the Bolshevik leadership interpreted it as state
control with committees playing at best a minor role. On three occasions
in early 1918, factory committee leaders attempted to implement their
democratic model, and each time the party leadership overruled them.[^5]

Lenin's vision of socialism equated
<a href="nationalization" class="wikilink"
title="nationalization">nationalization</a> with socialist
transformation. He wrote in 1917 that
<a href="state_capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a> merely needed to serve the
whole people to become socialism.[^6] This perspective meant workers'
<a href="self-management" class="wikilink"
title="self-management">self-management</a> was irrelevant. What
mattered was state ownership, not who managed production.

In April 1918, Lenin began advocating one-man management with
dictatorial powers, explicitly stating this was possible because peace
had been achieved and the task was now organization rather than
suppression of exploiters.[^7] This replaced workers' committees with
appointed managers, reintroducing <a href="hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> relations and eliminating
workplace
<a href="democracy" class="wikilink" title="democracy">democracy</a>.

### April 1918: First Mass Killings of Anarchists

In April 1918, the Cheka began its first extrajudicial executions in an
operation against anarchists in Petrograd and Moscow. By the end of the
operation, they had executed 800 without trials. Their rhetoric was to
attack "class enemies," but their secret orders were to liquidate all
anarchist organizations in the two principal cities.

On April 12, 1918, the Bolsheviks attacked 26 anarchist centers in
Moscow, killing dozens and arresting 500. Threatened by the dramatic
growth of the anarchist movement in Moscow,
<a href="Leon_Trotsky" class="wikilink" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a> and
the Bolshevik press had carried out a media campaign in collaboration
with the local bourgeoisie, accusing veteran revolutionaries of being
"bandits" and "criminals" for expropriating bourgeois properties, even
though these were put to the use of the revolution.

## Role of Objective Circumstances

Defenders of Bolshevism commonly argue that harsh circumstances forced
Lenin and Trotsky into authoritarian measures. However, this explanation
fails to account for several critical facts.

### The Civil War Excuse

Bolshevik authoritarianism began well before the major
<a href="Russian_Civil_War" class="wikilink" title="civil war">civil
war</a> fighting erupted in May 1918. Moreover, every revolution faces
similar challenges. Lenin repeatedly emphasized that revolution
inevitably brings civil war, economic disruption, and desperate
conditions. In 1917, he argued that only those in denial would think
revolution possible without an exceptionally complicated situation.[^8]

<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="Anarchists">Anarchists</a>
had long predicted these difficulties and developed their politics
specifically to address them through
<a href="decentralization" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a>, participatory structures rather
than <a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> power.

### The German Comparison

The comparison with
<a href="Germany" class="wikilink" title="Germany">Germany</a> is
instructive. The <a href="German_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="German Revolution">German Revolution</a> after 1918 faced
economic collapse equally severe as Russia's, with industrial production
falling to similar levels. Yet
<a href="Leninism" class="wikilink" title="Leninists">Leninists</a>
argue a successful revolution could have occurred there, contradicting
claims that Russia's economic conditions made authoritarianism
inevitable.

## Impact of Bolshevik Ideology

Bolshevik ideology shaped the policies implemented and made objective
circumstances worse. The party's commitment to extreme
<a href="centralization" class="wikilink"
title="centralization">centralization</a> created bureaucratic
inefficiency and eliminated the mass participation essential for
socialist construction.

### Centralization and Bureaucracy

The Bolsheviks built their system on the principle that power must be
centralized in state institutions controlled by the party. This
immediately removed power from the
<a href="working_class" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a> and placed it in the hands of government officials. A massive
state <a href="bureaucracy" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> developed from the start, with state
officials representing 30 percent of Moscow's workforce by August
1918.[^9]

This centralized structure proved catastrophically inefficient. The
central industrial administrations did not know how many enterprises
existed in their sectors. The glavki system required customers to go
through central ordering committees, creating enormous delays. Materials
accumulated in some locations while acute shortages existed elsewhere.
Unused stock coexisted with desperate scarcity.[^10]

Provincial authorities who understood local conditions argued that
centralization wasted resources and created chaos. They demonstrated
greater foresight than Moscow, substituting materials and finding
solutions long before the center issued relevant instructions. Yet the
party leadership refused to reconsider centralization, instead
reinforcing it even when confronted with evidence of its failures.[^11]

### Inefficiency of Centralized Production

The results were disastrous. The centralized system created chaos, with
multiple competing Bolshevik authorities issuing contradictory orders.
Railway journals noted the direct correlation between failing
productivity and the proliferation of competing authorities. One-man
management led to greater confusion and indecision rather than improved
efficiency.[^12]

Evidence suggests that workers' control could have succeeded. Production
rates and productivity climbed steadily after January 1918 in many
factories, with explicit credit given to factory committees. Some
factory committees successfully performed managerial tasks throughout
1919. Even during severe disruptions, factories remained active thanks
to workers' initiatives in securing raw materials.[^13]

### Agricultural Policies

Bolshevik agricultural policies reflected fundamental ignorance of
<a href="peasant" class="wikilink" title="peasant">peasant</a> life
combined with centralist ideology. Lenin vastly overestimated inequality
in villages, believing rich
<a href="kulak" class="wikilink" title="kulak">kulaks</a> dominated when
reality showed predominantly pre-capitalist peasant farming. Only one
percent of peasant households employed more than one laborer, yet the
party launched campaigns against kulaks as if they were a major
class.[^14]

The Committees of Poor Peasants policy of 1918 was pursued against the
advice and protest of Left-SRs, who had actual connections to peasant
communities. By 1919, even Lenin admitted these policies had been
failures that alienated the peasantry. Yet no fundamental change
occurred for another two years, until mass pressure forced the
<a href="New_Economic_Policy" class="wikilink"
title="New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a> in 1921.

The Bolsheviks also suppressed the extensive network of consumer
cooperatives because they were associated with moderate socialists. Food
requisitioning policies ignored the reality that peasants were willing
to trade grain at fair prices. In the Volga region, peasants showed
enthusiasm for selling grain to the government in autumn 1918. Only
after the state reduced prices by 25 percent and failed to provide
industrial goods did hoarding become a problem.[^15]

The regime's response to suppress private exchange as speculation drove
black market prices higher and made food shortages worse. By January
1919, only 19 percent of food came through official channels. The policy
of violent requisitioning led peasants to reduce planted acreage and
sparked insurrections across the countryside.

### The Red Army: From Revolutionary Force to Tool of Repression

In June 1918, Trotsky abolished any kind of worker control over the
<a href="Red_Army" class="wikilink" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>,
destroying the proletarian tradition that allowed soldiers to elect
their officers and enjoy real equality. He restored the old hierarchies
in the army and complemented them with a new ideological hierarchy
upheld through the sinister presence of the Cheka at every level,
destroying the capacity of the Red Army to function as a bastion of
revolutionary ideas and turning it into a mere tool of the Party.

Officers received status and high pay while common soldiers became
thralls, and anyone who spoke out against the regime would be shot.
Simultaneously, Trotsky carried out a mass recruitment of officers from
the old Tsarist army. Under Bolshevik dominion, the Red Army became an
aristocratic army. By 1918, 75 percent of officers were former tsarists,
and by the end of the Civil War that figure had climbed to 83 percent.

In contrast, all the prominent leaders of anarchist formations in the
Civil War were chosen by their comrades according to their abilities,
and they were workers or peasants. Leaders like
<a href="Maria_Nikiforova" class="wikilink"
title="Maria Nikiforova">Maria Nikiforova</a>,
<a href="Nestor_Makhno" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a>, Fyodor Shchuss, and
<a href="Anatoli_Zhelezniakov" class="wikilink"
title="Anatoli Zhelezniakov">Anatoli Zhelezniakov</a> were among the
most effective on the battlefield.

### War Communism

In June 1918, the Party implemented their policy of
"<a href="war_communism" class="wikilink" title="war communism">war
communism</a>." There was nothing communist about it; rather, it
constituted the Party's monopolization of the entire economy. It wasn't
workers and peasants who controlled the factories and the land, but
bureaucrats ruling from faraway offices. This policy imposed strict
discipline on workers, worsening of labor conditions and lengthening of
the workday, turned striking into an offense punishable by firing squad,
established state control over international commerce, and legalized the
forcible appropriation of all the peasants' goods and properties.

This inaugurated an agrarian policy even harsher and more exploitative
than that of tsarist serfdom, leading to millions of deaths among the
peasants and provoking constant rural rebellions against Bolshevik
power.

## Working Class Resistance

The claim that the Russian working class became declassed and atomized
during the civil war, rendering it incapable of collective action,
contradicts the extensive evidence of workers' resistance to Bolshevik
rule throughout this period.

An atomized, individualized mass does not require martial law, mass
arrests, lockouts, and armed repression to control. Yet these measures
were applied systematically against striking workers from early 1918
through 1921 and beyond. The very intensity of state repression
demonstrates that workers retained both organization and militancy.

### Early Protests

Worker protests against Bolshevik policies began within months of the
October revolution. In January 1918, authorities fired on a march
supporting the <a href="Constituent_Assembly" class="wikilink"
title="Constituent Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a>. May 1918 saw the
shooting of protesting workers and housewives in Kolpino, triggering a
massive wave of indignation that temporarily stopped work at numerous
plants. Protests spread to Moscow, Tula, Kolomna, and other cities. This
first major wave of labor protest commonly focused on Bolshevik
repression itself.[^16]

The Extraordinary Assembly of Delegates emerged from workers'
recognition that
<a href="trade_unions" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade
unions</a>, factory committees, and soviets had been transformed into
arbitrary bureaucratic government agencies. To counter this independent
workers' organization, the Bolsheviks organized non-party conferences,
implicitly acknowledging that soviets had become isolated from the
masses.

At the end of May and beginning of June, strikes protesting bread
shortages swept Petrograd factories. When the Assembly of Delegates
declared a general strike for July 2, authorities responded with
overwhelming force. Machine guns were set up throughout Petrograd and
Moscow, controls tightened in factories, meetings forcefully dispersed,
opposition presses sealed, union offices raided, martial law declared on
rail lines, and armed patrols authorized to prevent work stoppages.[^17]

### The Astrakhan Massacre

In March 1919, between 2,000 and 4,000 striking workers and Red Army
soldiers who had joined them were executed by the Cheka in the city of
Astrakhan. Many were thrown into the river with stones tied to their
necks, while the rest were killed by firing squad. To give an idea of
the primarily anti-worker scope of the Communists' activities, during
the same repressive campaign they killed a significantly smaller number
of bourgeoisie, between 600 and 1,000. The primary victims of the
Bolsheviks were from the popular classes.

On March 16, 1919, in Petrograd, the Cheka assaulted the Putilov
factory, where workers starving to death had begun a strike demanding
larger food rations, freedom of the press, the end of the
<a href="Red_Terror" class="wikilink" title="Red Terror">Red Terror</a>,
and the elimination of the privileges held by Communist Party members.
900 were arrested and 200 executed without trial.

### Continuing Resistance During Civil War

Contrary to claims that civil war loyalty prevented working class
opposition, <a href="strike" class="wikilink" title="strike">strikes</a>
and protests continued throughout 1918-1920. Each wave of unrest proved
more powerful than the last, culminating in the mass movement of late
1920.

Strike action remained endemic through the first nine months of 1920.
Soviet figures report 146 strikes involving 135,442 workers in 26
provinces. In Petrograd province, 73 strikes occurred with 85,642
participants from a total workforce of only 109,100 workers. The
geographical extent was impressive, spanning from Ekaterinburg to
Moscow, from Petrograd to Ekaterinoslavl.[^18]

Throughout 1920, Moscow experienced numerous strikes. When tram workers
struck in August, authorities closed workshops, deprived workers of
rations, and imprisoned 103 of 1,600 employees. Strikes in textile towns
around Moscow in November saw workers driven back by arrests and threats
of mass sackings. In Petrograd, the enormous Briansk works experienced
two major strikes, with the second resulting in martial law being
imposed on both the works and surrounding settlement.[^19]

### The 1921 Strike Wave

By early 1921, a revolutionary situation with workers in the vanguard
had emerged across Soviet Russia. Simultaneous strikes broke out in
Petrograd, Moscow, and other industrial regions. General strikes or
widespread unrest hit all but one major industrial region. Workers'
protest included not just strikes but factory occupations,
demonstrations, mass meetings, and physical resistance.[^20]

In Petrograd, protests spread through February, beginning with mass
meetings at workplaces. The Trubochny factory workforce walked out on
February 24, with workers from nearby factories joining to create a
crowd of 2,000 dispersed by armed military cadets. The next day brought
a near general strike. Zinoviev proclaimed martial law and overnight
Petrograd became an armed camp. Strikers were locked out, military force
applied, and widespread arrests made alongside economic
concessions.[^21]

Moscow saw similar upheaval. Industrial unrest turned into open
confrontation as protest spilled into streets, starting with strikes in
the heart of industrial Moscow that spread into surrounding provinces.
Moscow and Moscow province were placed under martial law. Meetings in
factories gathered to criticize government policies, beginning with
supply issues and developing into general political criticism. When
several thousand workers demonstrated on February 23, troops were
disarmed and locked in as precaution against fraternizing. Moscow was
placed under 24-hour watch by communist detachments and trustworthy army
units. Wide-scale arrests deprived the movement of leadership.[^22]

### The Bromlei Works

The Bromlei works events were particularly significant. A mass meeting
on March 25 passed an anarchist and Left-SR resolution supporting the
<a href="Kronstadt_Rebellion" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebels">Kronstadt rebels</a>. The party responded by
sacking all 3,000 workers en masse. Workers demonstrated through their
district, inspiring solidarity strikes involving over 3,000 workers
total. Managers at one print shop locked workers inside to prevent them
joining protests. While the party would negotiate economic issues, it
refused to discuss politics with workers. Arrested activists were not
released, the workforce was sacked, and workers selectively
re-employed.[^23]

Ekaterinoslavl saw a May strike wave inspired by Kronstadt that quickly
became politicized, with the strike committee raising demands very
similar to the Kronstadt rebels. The strike spread to workshops and main
factories via use of trains and telegraph, affecting an area up to fifty
miles around the town. The Cheka ended it through mass arrests and
shootings.[^24]

### Character of the Strikers

Evidence contradicts claims that strikes were conducted by newly arrived
peasants lacking proletarian consciousness. Clear continuity existed
between industrial unrest in 1920-21 and 1917. Strike leaders were
typically found among skilled male workers who enjoyed positions of
authority in informal shop-floor hierarchies. Long-standing workers were
prominent in protest, with the skilled metalworkers, railroad workers,
and printers demonstrating the most determined resistance.[^25]

In Petrograd, authentic proletariat remained until the end, having the
slenderest connections with countryside. There was no exodus of peasants
into starving towns. It was the famous Petrograd proletariat that played
such a leading role in both previous revolutions that finally resorted
to the strike. A sizeable core of veteran urban proletarians remained in
cities throughout the civil war. The loss of young activists rather than
all skilled and class-conscious urban workers caused declining Bolshevik
support.[^26]

The notion of declassing was developed by Lenin not to describe reality
but to justify political clampdown. As discontent among workers became
impossible to ignore, Lenin argued that workers' consciousness had
deteriorated. However, little evidence suggests that demands workers
made at the end of 1920 represented fundamental changes in aspirations
since 1917.[^27]

### Suppression of Organization

The Bolsheviks systematically destroyed workers' ability to organize
independently. Non-party workers' and peasants' conferences were
discontinued after providing effective platforms for criticism during
late 1920 disturbances. In soviets, workers increasingly turned to
non-party slates, winning majorities in industrial workers'
constituencies in many places. The Moscow soviet elections of April-May
1921 provided an opportunity to revive working-class participation, but
the Bolsheviks turned it down despite a high level of mass
activity.[^28]

The regime dispersed provincial trade union conferences in Vologda and
Vitebsk in 1921 because they had anti-communist majorities. When the
All-Russian Congress of Metalworkers' Union voted down the party list of
recommended candidates in May, the Central Committee disregarded every
vote and appointed a committee of its own choosing.[^29]

Fear of arrest limited participation in political life. Railway workers
in April 1920 demanded delegates be guaranteed freedom of debate and
immunity from arrest. Moscow Metalworkers' Union conference delegates in
February 1921 called for personal safety guarantees before airing
criticisms. Moscow soviet dissidents later demanded immunity from arrest
unless sanctioned by plenary session, yet immediately afterward two
delegates including an anarcho-syndicalist were detained.[^30]

### Terror Against Workers

By the end of 1920, workers faced the Cheka in their workplaces. While
impossible to measure accurately how many workers were shot for
participation in labor protest, evidence suggests shootings were
employed to inspire terror beyond occasional extreme cases. The regime
was ensuring silence through fear or weeding out politically conscious
workers through workplace purges and execution.[^31]

Of 17,000 camp detainees with available statistical information on
November 1, 1920, peasants and workers constituted the largest groups at
39 and 34 percent respectively. Of 40,913 prisoners held in December
1921, nearly 84 percent were illiterate or minimally educated, clearly
therefore either peasants or workers.[^32]

Throughout 1919, the Cheka continued and expanded a policy initiated the
year before to execute Red Army deserters. As an authoritarian,
involuntary army, the Red Army was plagued with desertions, of which
there were more than a million in a year. In cases of mass desertion,
the Cheka fell back on the tactic of holding family members hostage and
executing them one by one until the soldiers returned, and then
executing an exemplary number of the deserters.

The Cheka also developed methods of torture surpassing those of the
Inquisition. They slowly fed prisoners into ovens or vats of boiling
water, they flayed prisoners, they buried peasants alive, they put rats
in metal tubes against prisoners' bodies and put flames under the tubes
so that the rats would eat their way through the prisoners to escape.

## Repression of Revolutionary Parties

### The Socialist Revolutionaries

In July 1918, the left
<a href="Socialist_Revolutionary_Party" class="wikilink"
title="SRs">SRs</a> initiated an insurrection against Bolshevik power.
They were defeated, illegalized, and expelled from the soviet
government. As a consequence, the Bolsheviks ended up with an absolute
monopoly on state power and prohibited the participation of other
parties in the soviets.

In February 1919, the Bolsheviks granted an amnesty to the SRs. The
White Army was advancing on all fronts, and the Communists desperately
needed allies. When the SRs came out of clandestinity and set up offices
in Moscow, the Cheka began arresting successive waves of SR leadership,
accusing them of conspiracy, in order to bring about the fracturing and
then destruction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party.

### Peasant Rebellions

Between May 1 and 3, 1920, a peasant and anarchist insurrection broke
out in the regions of Altai and Tomsk, with the eventual participation
of 10,000 combatants. It was principally directed against the White
Army, but their support for decentralized, local control ran them afoul
of the Communists, who sought to crush the rebellion. The resistance
continued until the end of 1921.

On August 19, 1920, the <a href="Tambov_Rebellion" class="wikilink"
title="Tambov peasant rebellion">Tambov peasant rebellion</a> began when
a "requisitioning" squad of the Red Army beat the old men of a small
village to force the inhabitants to surrender more grain to the
government. By October, the peasants had fielded 50,000 combatants to
fight the Communist authority. By January 1921, the uprising had
extended to include Samara, Astrakhan, Saratov, and parts of Siberia.

With 70,000 combatants, they defended their territory from the
Communists until victories on other fronts enabled the deployment of
100,000 Red Army soldiers. To crush the revolt, the Communists used
chemical weapons for approximately three months in 1921, killing many
civilians. They sent 50,000 peasants—mostly women and the elderly—to
concentration camps as hostages. The majority died. Between the war, the
concentration camps, and the executions, the region lost some 240,000
inhabitants, the great majority peasants and non-combatants.

### The Free Territory of Ukraine

In November 1918, throughout a large territory in south
<a href="Ukraine" class="wikilink" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>
comprising 7 million inhabitants, primarily peasants, locals founded the
<a href="Free_Territory_of_Ukraine" class="wikilink"
title="Volnaya Territoriya">Volnaya Territoriya</a> or "Free Territory,"
an anarchist society based on communes, free and decentralized militias,
land <a href="collectivization" class="wikilink"
title="collectivization">collectivization</a> without intermediaries and
direct worker control of industry, universal
<a href="education" class="wikilink" title="education">education</a>
based on the modern pedagogy of
<a href="Francesc_Ferrer_i_Guardia" class="wikilink"
title="Francesc Ferrer i Guardia">Francesc Ferrer i Guardia</a>, and
soviets free from party control but open to participation from any
current of the worker and peasant classes and federated in a
decentralized way.

The movement was rooted in the anarchist militias that had fought
against the German occupiers to whom Lenin had handed over the entire
country. The peasant militias immediately began holding the line against
General Denikin of the White Army, but Lenin and Trotsky kept them from
receiving munitions and functioning weapons, effectively sabotaging the
front and causing many deaths.

In June 1919, the Bolsheviks began their first attempt to illegalize and
liquidate the peasant anarchists of Ukraine fighting alongside Makhno.
Already in May, they had made a failed attempt to assassinate Makhno.
Trotsky stated that he preferred for all of Ukraine to fall to the White
Army than to leave the anarchists to carry out their activity. The
campaign intensified after the defeat of Denikin in the fall. The
anarchist fighters played a key role in his defeat and afterwards the
Bolsheviks didn't have as much need for an alliance with the anarchists.

In November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a major campaign against
Makhno's Revolutionary Insurgent Army in Ukraine, mobilizing tens of
thousands of troops. The campaign began as a surprise attack. The day
after anarchist forces managed to seize the Perekop Isthmus, the
fortified pass into the Crimean Peninsula where Wrangel was based, and
which the Red Army had been unable to take, the Bolsheviks began
arresting and executing their supposed allies, the anarchists. Their
treachery began ten months of intense guerrilla warfare before the
Communists finally crushed the insurgent peasants.

### The Kronstadt Rebellion

On February 28, 1921, delegates of the revolutionary sailors and workers
from the <a href="Kronstadt_Rebellion" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> naval base published a declaration in
solidarity with the workers of Petrograd, recently repressed after going
on strike against the starvation conditions. The Bolsheviks responded
with more repression, provoking a rebellion on Kronstadt.

The Kronstadt rebels, long recognized as the heart of the revolution,
demanded free soviets, an end to the Bolshevik dictatorship, and the
recovery of the Revolution's principles. Trotsky led a military
expedition that ended with the total suppression of the soviet on March
19, 1921. The Red Army played the role of the Versailles troops,
executing more than 2,000 people. They sent several thousand more to the
gulag, where the majority died.

## Alternatives That Existed

The claim that no alternative to Bolshevik policies existed cannot be
sustained. Even Bolsheviks admitted in 1919 that their 1918 decisions
had been wrong. The New Economic Policy was introduced in 1921 under
immense popular pressure in conditions worse than those of 1918.

### Success of Workers' Control

The factory committees demonstrated that workers' control could function
effectively. Production rates and productivity climbed in early 1918
where committees operated, with explicit credit given to their
initiatives. The autonomous self-activity at the grassroots kept the
dysfunctional centralized system operating. When the Commissariat of
Finance proved bureaucratically cumbersome, committed revolutionaries
felt impelled to act independently to get what workers and factories
needed, even circumventing party directives.[^33]

### Provincial Effectiveness

Provincial authorities repeatedly demonstrated greater effectiveness
than central bodies. They substituted materials before Moscow issued
instructions, found ways of rationing resources the center had not yet
decided upon, and understood local conditions far better than distant
bureaucrats. The run-down of large-scale industry and bureaucratic
methods applied to production orders led the Red Army to turn to
small-scale workplaces that largely escaped glavk administration,
allowing support of a well-equipped army amid general distress and
disorganization.[^34]

### The Makhnovist Counter-Example

The <a href="Makhnovism" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine provides
a crucial counter-example. Operating in the same objective conditions as
the Bolsheviks—civil war, economic disruption, isolation—the Makhnovists
implemented radically different policies. They called soviet congresses
while Bolsheviks disbanded them. They encouraged free speech and
organization while Bolsheviks crushed both. While Bolsheviks raised
party dictatorship and one-man management to ideological truisms,
Makhnovists stood for and implemented workplace, army, village and
soviet self-management. Rather than being necessary or functional,
Bolshevik policies might have made the war more difficult and
costly.[^35]

## Conclusion

The failure of the Russian Revolution to establish socialism resulted
from the interaction of difficult objective circumstances with Bolshevik
ideology and practice. The party's commitment to centralization, state
ownership over workers' control, and party dictatorship transformed what
began as a genuine workers' revolution into a system of state capitalism
that systematically eliminated mass participation and socialist
construction from below.

The extensive evidence of workers' resistance throughout the civil war
period demonstrates that a social base existed for alternative
approaches. Rather than an atomized mass incapable of collective action,
Russian workers repeatedly organized strikes, demonstrations, and
protests demanding genuine soviet democracy and workers' control. The
Bolshevik regime's systematic repression of this movement in the name of
defending the revolution reveals the fundamental contradiction at the
heart of the concept of a workers' state.

As anarchists had long predicted, the attempt to build socialism through
state power led inevitably to the creation of a new ruling class. The
state apparatus developed interests separate from and opposed to those
of the working class it claimed to represent. What was required was not
a workers' state but the abolition of the state and the construction of
socialism through the direct self-organization of workers and peasants
in their own democratic institutions.
