# Non-Aggression Principle

## Overview

The **Non-Aggression Principle** (NAP), also called the **non-aggression
axiom**, **non-coercion principle**, or **zero-aggression principle**,
is a concept central to "<a   href="right-libertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-libertarian">"right-libertarian</a> and
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalist">"anarcho-capitalist</a> philosophy which
claims that "aggression" - defined as initiating or threatening forceful
interference with individuals or their property - is illegitimate and
should be prohibited.[^1]

The NAP is presented by its proponents as the foundational principle
from which all other rights can be deduced, and is used to justify
extreme "<a   href="laissez-faire_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="laissez-faire capitalism">"laissez-faire capitalism</a>,
opposition to
"<a   href="taxation.md" class="wikilink" title="taxation">"taxation</a>, and
rejection of government regulation. Like the
"<a   href="Golden_Rule.md" class="wikilink" title="Golden Rule">"Golden
Rule</a>, the NAP follows an ethics of reciprocity, where the
permissibility of an action depends on the preceding actions of others.

**Anarchists fundamentally reject the Non-Aggression Principle** as both
philosophically incoherent and politically reactionary. Rather than
being a neutral principle against violence, the NAP is a circular
argument designed to preserve existing property relations through
definitional sleight-of-hand. What counts as "aggression" is defined by
one's theory of property rights, making the NAP incapable of
establishing which property rights are legitimate in the first place.

## Origins

### Early Formulations

The concept has roots in
"<a   href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">"John Locke</a>'s
political philosophy, though the specific formulation emerged in the
20th century. The first clear articulation appeared in
"<a   href="Ayn_Rand.md" class="wikilink" title="Ayn Rand">"Ayn Rand</a>'s 1946
article "The Textbook of Americanism," written for the Motion Picture
Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals - a conservative
Hollywood organization that reported suspected communists to the House
Un-American Activities Committee.

Rand wrote: "A right cannot be violated except by physical force... NO
MAN HAS THE RIGHT TO INITIATE THE USE OF PHYSICAL FORCE AGAINST ANOTHER
MAN."[^2] She presented this as the singular unifying principle
underlying all rights theory, claiming it could determine objectively
when rights had been violated.

When Rand submitted this work to the Foundation for Economic Education,
reviewers immediately questioned its logical foundation. One noted: "Her
statement that these rights are granted to man by the fact of birth as a
man not by an act of society, is illogical jargon." Another found her
"line of logic...very weak."[^3] Rather than address these criticisms,
Rand demanded to know the identities of her anonymous critics and
refused to revise her arguments.

### Rothbard's Axiom

"<a   href="Murray_Rothbard.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Rothbard">"Murray Rothbard</a> developed a similar concept
he called the "non-aggression axiom" by at least 1963. In his 1973 book
*For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto*, he wrote: "The
libertarian creed rests upon one central axiom: that no man or group of
men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else...
'Aggression' is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of
physical violence against the person or property of anyone else."[^4]

Rothbard deliberately appropriated the term "libertarian" from
anarchists and socialists, boasting in *The Betrayal of the American
Right*: "One gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that,
for the first time in my memory, we, 'our side,' had captured a crucial
word from the enemy."[^5]

The relationship between Rand and Rothbard was contentious. While
Rothbard credited Rand with introducing him to natural rights theory,
she accused him of plagiarism. The Ayn Rand Institute still maintains
that Rothbard "plagiarize\[d\] Ayn Rand's non-initiation of force
principle and convert\[ed\] it into an axiom."

## Right-Libertarian Theory

### Core Claims

Proponents of the NAP make three main assertions:

- The NAP forbids the initiation of force or aggression under all
  circumstances
- All legitimate rights can be deduced from the NAP
- Consistently applying the NAP necessarily produces extreme
  "<a   href="propertarian.md" class="wikilink"
  title="propertarian">"propertarian</a> positions - no
  "<a   href="taxation.md" class="wikilink" title="taxation">"taxation</a>, no
  regulation, absolute "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
  title="private property">"private property</a> rights

The principle is meant to distinguish between aggressive force
(forbidden) and defensive force (permitted). Proponents claim this
provides an objective, rational foundation for a complete political
philosophy.

### Application to Property

Central to right-libertarian use of the NAP is extending it beyond
bodily autonomy to encompass "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">"private property</a>. Any interference with
property - including taxation, regulation, or
"<a   href="trespassing.md" class="wikilink"
title="trespassing">"trespassing</a> - is defined as "aggression"
equivalent to physical assault. This allows proponents to claim that
violent defense of property claims is merely "self-defense."

As Rothbard argued, all alleged "human rights" ultimately reduce to
property rights: "Freedom of speech is supposed to mean the right of
everyone to say whatever he likes. But the neglected question is:
Where?... In short, he has this right only either on his own property or
on the property of someone who has agreed... there is no such thing as a
separate 'right to free speech'; there is only a man's property
right."[^6]

Thus for those without property, no rights exist - including no right to
speak, assemble, or even exist in physical space.

## Anarchist Critique

### Circular Reasoning

The fundamental flaw in the NAP is that it engages in circular
reasoning. The concept of "aggression" presupposes a theory of
legitimate property rights, yet the NAP is presented as the foundation
from which property rights are derived.

Rothbard himself demonstrated this circularity in *For a New Liberty*.
After claiming the non-aggression axiom as foundational, he immediately
abandoned it when discussing property, instead turning to Lockean
"<a   href="homesteading.md" class="wikilink"
title="homesteading">"homesteading</a> theory to determine legitimate
ownership. He could not use the NAP to determine whether someone
reclaiming a watch they previously owned was "aggression" - he needed a
separate theory of property first.[^7]

As philosopher Matt Zwolinski noted: "The NAP's focus on 'aggression'
and 'violence' is at best superfluous, and at worst misleading. It is
the enforcement of property rights, not the prohibition of aggression,
that is fundamental to libertarianism."[^8]

The NAP cannot establish what our rights are because what counts as
"aggression" depends entirely on what rights already exist. A socialist
could claim capitalist property enforcement violates the NAP because the
people collectively own productive resources. A capitalist could claim
taxation violates the NAP because individuals privately own their labor.
**Both are simply defining "aggression" according to their preferred
property system.**

### Equating Property with Personhood

The NAP requires treating violations of property claims as equivalent to
violations of bodily autonomy. This is both philosophically absurd and
politically reactionary.

Human bodies are fundamentally different from external objects.
Consciousness, autonomy, and dignity are inherent to persons - they
cannot be separated from us without ceasing to exist. External objects
have no such properties. Equating damage to objects with assault on
persons is a category error that reveals the NAP's true purpose:
protecting the property of the wealthy against the working class.

This equation leads to morally grotesque conclusions. Under the NAP,
someone who steps one foot onto claimed land without permission can be
met with lethal force, while someone who watches another person drown
rather than throw them a rope has committed no wrongdoing. **The system
that calls itself "non-aggressive" justifies shooting trespassers while
prohibiting nothing more than requiring the wealthy share their excess
resources.**

### Action/Inaction False Dichotomy

The NAP relies on a false distinction between "action" and "inaction"
that collapses under scrutiny. Proponents claim that actively harming
someone violates the NAP, but passively allowing harm does not - only
"initiating" force is prohibited.

This distinction is incoherent. Consider: Is someone who swerves to hit
a pedestrian committing aggression? Yes. What about someone who refuses
to swerve to avoid a pedestrian despite having ample time? Under the
NAP, this is mere "inaction" and thus permissible. But we could easily
rephrase these scenarios to reverse which appears as "action" versus
"inaction" - is holding a heavy object over a bomb detonator an
"action," making its release mere "inaction"?

The arbitrariness of this distinction reveals its ideological function.
By defining letting people starve, denying them access to unused
resources, or refusing life-saving assistance as mere "inaction," the
NAP provides cover for capitalism's structural violence while condemning
only direct physical confrontation of property claims.

As one critic noted: "Stepping in to assist an injured worker on
someone's private property is seen as an act of aggression. Natural
human compassion can very often be seen as 'aggression.' No sane or
rational person would think that."[^9]

### Incomplete Moral Philosophy

Even if taken seriously, the NAP cannot function as a complete moral
system. It prohibits certain actions but provides no positive guidance
and permits morally abhorrent behavior.

Consider: You encounter someone hanging from a cliff begging for help.
Under the NAP and "<a   href="negative_rights.md" class="wikilink"
title="negative rights">"negative rights</a>, you may walk away - you are
"initiating" nothing. Most people would rightfully consider this deeply
immoral, potentially even considering you responsible for their death.
Yet the NAP is indifferent.

Is stealing wrong? Generally yes. But what if you're starving and steal
bread to survive? Most rational people would not condemn this, yet it
clearly violates the NAP by "aggressing" against the bread owner's
property. The NAP provides no framework for weighing competing values or
considering context - it demands rigid adherence regardless of
consequences.

The claim that the NAP represents objective morality is itself suspect.
**Morality is contextual and requires judgment.** The NAP attempts to
eliminate moral reasoning by replacing it with a simple rule, but this
only works by arbitrarily defining away all difficult cases.

### Preserving the Status Quo

The NAP's arbitrary nature becomes clear when examining how it treats
property that was stolen or acquired through violence. Typically,
there's a precise cutoff point - exactly enough time to legitimize
current holdings of white, male capitalists while delegitimizing claims
by indigenous peoples, formerly enslaved people, or workers.

If property was stolen yesterday, the NAP permits reclaiming it by
force. If it was stolen a century ago during
"<a   href="colonialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">"colonialism</a> or
"<a   href="enclosure_of_the_commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="enclosure of the commons">"enclosure of the commons</a>, suddenly
we must respect current ownership and reclamation becomes "aggression."
The principle that claims to be based on rational deduction conveniently
produces conclusions that preserve existing power structures.

This reveals that the NAP is not about opposing aggression, but about
opposing challenges to capitalist property relations. It defines
resistance to established property claims as "initiating force" while
treating the violent enforcement of those claims as legitimate
"defense."

### Children and Dependents

The NAP creates severe problems regarding children, disabled people, and
other dependents who cannot be meaningfully described as autonomous
property-owning agents.

Some right-libertarians have argued that children are property of their
parents. Others claim parents have no obligation to feed their children,
and letting them starve is merely "inaction" rather than aggression.
"<a   href="Murray_Rothbard.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Rothbard">"Murray Rothbard</a> explicitly defended parents'
right to let babies die through neglect, arguing that forcing parents to
care for children would violate the NAP.[^10]

These grotesque conclusions follow logically from the NAP's framework.
If all obligations must be voluntarily contracted, and infants cannot
consent to contracts, then no obligations to them exist. **A philosophy
that permits child abandonment while prohibiting taxation has revealed
its moral bankruptcy.**

### Definitional Manipulation

The NAP's flexibility in defining "aggression" allows its proponents to
declare virtually anything they dislike as a form of force requiring
violent resistance.
"<a   href="Taxation.md" class="wikilink" title="Taxation">"Taxation</a> is
"aggression at gunpoint."
"<a   href="Regulation.md" class="wikilink" title="Regulation">"Regulation</a>
is "violence." Even voluntary
"<a   href="boycotts.md" class="wikilink" title="boycotts">"boycotts</a> or
"<a   href="strikes.md" class="wikilink" title="strikes">"strikes</a> are
sometimes characterized as aggression.

Meanwhile, actions right-libertarians support are defined as
non-aggressive regardless of their impacts. Pollution that destroys
others' health and property is not "aggression" unless specific
causation can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Economic coercion
through monopoly control of resources is not "aggression" because it
involves no direct physical force. Evicting people from their homes is
not "aggression" if proper ownership procedures were followed.

As philosopher Julian Sanchez argued: "The appeal of the NAP lies in its
apparent simplicity and intuitive plausibility (tautologies tend to be
intuitively plausible), but it's typically deployed in a way that
amounts to a kind of shell game."[^11]

### Incompatibility with Modern Life

Consistently applying the NAP would prohibit nearly all modern economic
activity. Any pollution, no matter how minor, crosses property
boundaries and thus constitutes aggression. This would forbid driving,
manufacturing, and starting fires. Even breathing releases carbon
dioxide onto others' property.

Right-libertarians respond by claiming only "significant" boundary
crossings count as aggression, or that some level is acceptable if
compensation is paid. **But this directly contradicts the NAP's absolute
prohibition on initiating force.** Once exceptions are admitted, the
principle becomes just another utilitarian calculation with extra steps.

The fact that even NAP proponents must abandon their principle to make
society functional demonstrates its uselessness as moral guidance.

## Anarchist Alternative

Rather than basing ethics on a circular definition of "aggression,"
anarchists ground their opposition to violence in substantive values:

- **Positive freedom** - not merely absence of interference, but access
  to resources needed for human flourishing
- **Solidarity** - mutual aid and collective responsibility rather than
  atomized individualism
- **Equality** - opposition to all forms of domination and hierarchy,
  not just certain physical acts
- **Context and consequences** - moral reasoning that considers actual
  impacts rather than abstract rules

Anarchists recognize that violence takes many forms beyond direct
physical force. Economic coercion, structural inequality, and
deprivation of resources are all forms of violence that the NAP ignores
or actively legitimizes. A truly liberatory ethics must address these
systemic issues rather than focusing solely on individual physical
confrontations.

The closest anarchist analogue to the NAP is
"<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">"mutualism</a>'s
rigorous application of the ethic of reciprocity - the
"<a   href="Golden_Rule.md" class="wikilink" title="Golden Rule">"Golden
Rule</a>. However, this is understood as one principle among many within
a complete moral framework, not as an axiom from which everything else
derives. As Alexander Berkman argued:

> "Anarchism is opposed to any interference with your liberty, be it by
> force and violence or by any other means... But if any one attacks
> you, then it is he who is invading you, he who is employing violence
> against you. You have a right to defend yourself. More than that, it
> is your duty, as an Anarchist, to protect your liberty, to resist
> coercion and compulsion."[^12]

The distinction is that anarchists like Berkman do not begin with
non-aggression alone, but **with a developed understanding of freedom,
equality, and solidarity together with class analysis of domination and
exploitation.** Resistance to oppression is justified not by abstract
rules about "initiation," but by substantive commitments to human
liberation.

## Criticism

Some right-libertarian philosophers have themselves recognized the NAP's
flaws. David Friedman noted the principle's ambiguity through a
"<a   href="sorites_paradox.md" class="wikilink"
title="sorites paradox">"sorites paradox</a>: shining a flashlight on
someone's property is not aggression, but shining a gigawatt laser
certainly is - yet both involve photons crossing boundaries, with no
clear cutoff point deducible from the principle itself.[^13]

Matt Zwolinski identified the NAP as "parasitic on a theory of
property," noting that "whether this is so depends entirely on the
relevant property rights."[^14]

Even defenders of the NAP like David Gordon could only argue it adds
something by ruling out using force to achieve non-rights-based goals -
tacitly admitting it cannot establish what rights exist in the first
place.

Critics also note the NAP is used as a rhetorical weapon rather than a
genuine ethical principle. As one anarchist observed: "When someone
explains that according to the NAP, this or that is wrong, they mostly
sound like 'This or that is wrong, because I say so.'"[^15]
