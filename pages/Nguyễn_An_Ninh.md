# Nguyễn An Ninh

**Nguyễn An Ninh** (6 September 1900 – 14 August 1943) was a Vietnamese
revolutionary journalist, publicist, and anti-colonial activist who
operated in <a href="French_Cochinchina" class="wikilink"
title="French Cochinchina">French Cochinchina</a>. An independent and
charismatic figure, Ninh refused to join any political party, instead
focusing on grassroots organizing and mass movements. He collaborated
extensively with anarchists and <a href="Trotskyism" class="wikilink"
title="Trotskyists">Trotskyists</a>, and his work emphasized direct
action, tax resistance, and popular self-organization against colonial
rule.

## Early Life

Nguyễn An Ninh was born in Long Thượng commune, Cần Giuộc district, Chợ
Lớn province (now part of Tây Ninh province), Cochinchina. His father,
Nguyễn An Khương, was a landowner and scholar who supported the Duy Tân
hội reform movement. As a result of this political activity, his father
was excluded from Saigon and banned from journalism in 1908.[^1]

Ninh received a French education, which took him to Paris in 1918. He
graduated from the Sorbonne with a degree in Law at age 20.

## Political Development

### Paris and the Five Dragons

While in Paris, Nguyễn An Ninh joined the *Groupe des Patriotes
Annamites* (The Group of Vietnamese Patriots), which included
<a href="Phan_Châu_Trinh" class="wikilink" title="Phan Châu Trinh">Phan
Châu Trinh</a>, Phan Văn Trường, Nguyễn Thế Truyền, and the future
<a href="Ho_Chi_Minh" class="wikilink" title="Ho Chi Minh">Ho Chi
Minh</a>.[^2] Together, this group known as the "Five Dragons" (*Ngũ
Long*) indicted French colonial policy in the socialist press. In 1923,
Ninh developed and published these critiques as *La France en
Indochine*.[^3]

In 1919, the group attempted to present delegates to the Versailles
Peace conference with an eight-point programme for colonial
self-determination.

### *La Cloche Fêlée*

Within months of returning from France, Nguyễn An Ninh began publishing
*La Cloche Fêlée* (The Cracked Bell, after
<a href="Baudelaire" class="wikilink" title="Baudelaire">Baudelaire</a>'s
poem) in Saigon in December 1923. As editor-in-chief, reporter,
type-setter, and even street seller, he produced the paper
intermittently as a "Journal for the Propagation of French Ideas." The
paper's appeals drew thousands of young workers and students to protest
debt peonage and deportations, and to demand freedom of press,
education, and assembly.

The paper published Ninh's influential speech from October 1923, in
which he exhorted young people to "leave the homes of your fathers" and
embrace the world, shaking off the "suffocating ignorance" of
obscurantism.[^4] While acknowledging that Vietnam's oppression came
from France, Ninh argued that so did the spirit of liberation.

Ninh published his own translation of
<a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s *The Social
Contract* under the title *The Ideal of Annamese Youth*.[^5] He drew
inspiration from diverse anti-authoritarian sources, including Indian
poet <a href="Rabindranath_Tagore" class="wikilink"
title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>—"those who take
pleasure in dominating foreign races abdicate little by little their own
liberty"—and German foreign minister
<a href="Walther_Rathenau" class="wikilink"
title="Walther Rathenau">Walther Rathenau</a>—"He who wants to rule
above slaves is himself an escaped slave; the only man who is free is
the one who is willing to be followed by freemen and willingly serves
free men".[^6]

In March 1926, following the death of Phan Chau Trinh and Ninh's arrest,
*La Cloche Fêlée* began serializing
*<a href="The_Communist_Manifesto" class="wikilink"
title="The Communist Manifesto">The Communist Manifesto</a>*.[^7]

### Repression and Popular Response

Ninh was arrested on 21 March 1926. The result was an unprecedented
demonstration against the government on 4 April—seventy thousand people
paraded with Phan Châu Trinh's funeral cortege. When Ninh's 18-month
sentence was announced on 24 April 1926, students and school children in
Saigon and the region deserted their classes en masse. More than a
thousand were expelled.[^8]

Governor Maurice Cognacq told Ninh: "This country has no need for
intellectuals. This country is very simple. If you want to be
intellectual, get the hell out of here, go to Moscow, you'll know that
the seeds you want to sow in this country can never sprout."

## Grassroots Organizing

### Tax Resistance and Village Organizing

Early in 1928, Nguyễn An Ninh began traveling by bicycle from village to
village, his head shaved like a Buddhist monk.[^9] He was accompanied by
Pham Văn Chieu and the later Trotskyist leader
<a href="Phan_Văn_Hùm" class="wikilink" title="Phan Văn Hùm">Phan Văn
Hùm</a>. The only concrete advice Ninh is said to have given was for
people to withhold their taxes, with the suggestion that within three
years the colonialists would either capitulate or face a popular
uprising.[^10]

Significantly, Ninh avoided creating a centralized command structure,
preferring horizontal organizing methods. This anti-hierarchical
approach reflected anarchist principles of self-organization and direct
action.

### The "Nguyễn An Ninh Secret Society"

In 1929, more than a hundred peasants and day laborers were convicted in
Saigon for membership in the "Nguyễn An Ninh Secret Society" (also known
as *Thanh niên Cao vọng Đảng*, the Youth Salvation Party). According to
the colonial Sûreté, it had been an insurrectionist conspiracy promising
"some kind of agrarian socialism."

Trotskyist chronicler
<a href="Ngo_Van" class="wikilink" title="Ngo Van">Ngo Van</a> concluded
that the "Society" was largely a figment of "denunciations and
torture-induced confessions."[^11] While Ninh himself avoided creating a
centralized command structure, some of his comrades may have tried to
organize in his wake, and other underground groups used his name to
rally support.

In a serialized account of their shared imprisonment in Saigon's *Maison
Centrale*,[^12] Phan Văn Hùm eulogized Ninh as a man who, forsaking
government offers of land and position, had struck "terror into the
hearts of corrupt, servile sycophants" and shaken "the corner of the
southern sky."[^13]

## *La Lutte* Collaboration

Between 1930 and the end of 1932, the colonial authorities arrested more
than 12,000 political prisoners, 7,000 of whom were sent to penal
colonies. In response to this repression, several surviving
anti-colonial representatives gathered around Nguyễn An Ninh to bury
their differences and oppose the government together.

In 1933, this group put forward a common "Workers' List" for the Saigon
municipal elections. The group included Nguyễn Văn Tạo of the
Indochinese Communist Party, Trotskyist
<a href="Tạ_Thu_Thâu" class="wikilink" title="Tạ Thu Thâu">Tạ Thu
Thâu</a>, **anarchist Trinh Hung Ngau**, and independent nationalist
Tran Van Thach. They briefly published the paper *La Lutte* (The
Struggle) to rally support. Despite the restricted franchise, two of the
group were elected, though denied their seats. Ngo Van identifies Nguyễn
An Ninh as having been "the real linchpin" of this collaboration.[^14]

In 1934, Ninh helped revive the
*<a href="La_Lutte_(newspaper)" class="wikilink" title="La Lutte">La
Lutte</a>* collaboration. The *Lutteurs* "focused squarely on the plight
of the urban poor, the workers and peasant laborers."[^15]

However, from 1936, the Moscow Trials and the failure of the Popular
Front government in France to deliver colonial reform ensured a split.
Tạ Thu Thâu and Nguyễn Văn Tạo came together for the last time in the
April 1937 city council elections.

### Independence from Party Politics

Despite pressure from various quarters, Ninh consistently refused to
join the Communist Party, believing himself of greater service to the
movement as a non-party "patriotic intellectual." This independence
allowed him to maintain collaboration across factional lines and resist
the sectarian conflicts that divided other anti-colonial forces.

When Ngo Van encountered Nguyễn An Ninh in Saigon's *Maison Central*
prison in 1936 and asked him about his "agrarian programme," Ninh
"raised his eyes \[over the prison walls\] toward the tamarind trees and
began to sing *Auprès de ma blonde*: 'In my father's garden . . . All
the birds in the world come to build their nests'." He later gave Ngo
Van <a href="Louis-Ferdinand_Céline" class="wikilink"
title="Céline">Céline</a>'s "explosive" *Journey to the End of the
Night*.[^16]

## Final Years

In the wake of renewed labor unrest, Nguyễn An Ninh was imprisoned again
with Tạ Thu Thâu and Nguyen Van Tao. When released early in 1939 under
house arrest, he was persuaded to let his name go forward with Communist
Party cadres as a Democratic Front candidate in the April 1939
Cochinchina Colonial Council elections.[^17] His list was defeated by
the now wholly Trotskyist *lutteurs*, whose revolutionary platform
included radical land redistribution and
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a>.[^18]

## Death

When the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact sundered Franco-Soviet relations on 23
August 1939 and war followed, "sedition" of every stripe was repressed.
Nguyễn An Ninh was sentenced to 5 years in prison and 10 years exile.

Nguyen An Ninh died in the <a href="Côn_Đảo_Prison" class="wikilink"
title="Côn Đảo island prison">Côn Đảo island prison</a>, Poulo Condore,
on 14 August 1943. It is possible his jailers decided his fate, viewing
him as a figure the Japanese occupiers would seek to use politically.

## Legacy

Nguyễn An Ninh represents an important tradition of anti-authoritarian,
non-sectarian revolutionary organizing in colonial Vietnam. His refusal
to submit to party discipline, his emphasis on grassroots organizing and
direct action (particularly tax resistance), and his ability to build
bridges across different anti-colonial factions demonstrate key
anarchist principles in practice.

His work with *La Cloche Fêlée* showed how revolutionary ideas could be
disseminated to reach workers, students, and peasants, creating mass
movements without vanguard party structures. His collaboration with
anarchists like Trinh Hung Ngau in the *La Lutte* group demonstrated the
potential for anti-authoritarian united fronts against colonialism.

The Vietnamese Socialist Republic posthumously conferred upon Nguyễn An
Ninh the title "Revolutionary Martyr" on 1 August 1980. In Ho Chi Minh
City, he is memorialized in the Nguyễn An Ninh High School and Nguyễn An
Ninh Street. A museum dedicated to him was opened in District 12 in
2002.
