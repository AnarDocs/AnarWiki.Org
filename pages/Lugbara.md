> Over a third of a million Lugbara dwell in southern Uganda and
> northern Zaire. As horticulturalists they grow chiefly eleusine and
> sorghum, but they also keep some cattle. The Lugbara live on open
> rolling plains in a highland area of 4-5,000 feet elevation. They,
> like their neighbours, are politically decentralised, traditionally
> having no chiefs and the fundamental form of social organisation is
> the segmentary lineage.[^1]
>
> The basic social grouping is the family, either some type of joint
> family or a nuclear group. Families related through males and dwelling
> in a neighbourhood comprise a 'family cluster' or minimal lineage of
> three to four generations depth. The cluster might also include
> individuals who are not members of the lineage group, such as a
> sister's son or daughter's husband. It might also have 'clients'
> residing within it. These are persons who escaped from their own homes
> in times of war or famine, or who had been expelled for some offence.
> Except for those clients who had not married into the cluster, the
> residents are subject to the elder of the group, who is its
> genealogically senior member. His authority is primarily ritual in
> that he can invoke the ancestral ghosts, who have influence only on
> their descendents.
>
> The lineage owns the territory within which its members reside and the
> elder allocates use rights within it as well as the rights to its
> resources, including daughters of the lineage. Further, he is in
> control of the use of livestock. Within the minimal lineage the elder
> is responsible for settling disputes. He may also initiate hostile
> relations with other groups.
>
> Related minimal lineages form yet another lineage segment (minor
> lineage), which in turn is consolidated into larger segments (major
> lineages) and these in turn constitute sub clans which consolidate to
> form clans. However, the number of levels of segmentation among the
> Lugbara varies. The following diagram of the levels of segmentation
> within a Lugbara tribe shows on the right side the various segments as
> territorial units, beginning at the lowest level of the family cluster
> and culminating in the subtribe. On the left side of the diagram is
> the segmentary system in terms of descent groups, commencing with the
> smallest segment, the minimal lineage, whose personnel is roughly
> equivalent to the territorial unit, the family cluster. (It will be
> recalled that some residents of the family cluster are not agnatic
> kinsmen.) Correspondingly each higher level of segmentation of the
> descent groups has an approximate correspondence to equivalent levels
> of territorial groups. Again, the rough correspondence results from
> the fact that while . territories are identified with a given descent
> group, they may include residents not belonging to that descent group.

> As is usual in other systems of this sort, the most intense feelings

> people, until one can say that the tribal level has little or no
> significance. Nevertheless, all Lugbara have the belief that they are
> all kin. They express their own social relations by speaking of groups
> which are *juru*, wherein potentially hostile relations obtain, and
> those which are *o'dipi*, which include all those within a group's
> direct social relations which are not *juru*. Ordinarily *o'dipi*
> refers to the agnatic descendants of a common ancestor, often a man's
> major lineage. Thus, as with the latter, among *o'dipi* there is
> supposed to be no fighting, no intermarriage and any girl is called
> 'sister'. At any given time a group may be regarded as *juru* and
> later it may become *o'dipi*.

[^1]: The classical conception of the segmentary lineage system as
    outlined by E. E. Evans-Pritchard in The Nuer, and as reflected in
    Middleton's description of the Lugbara has been subjected to
    considerable cntic1sm over the last several years. The criticism
    stresses the following points:

    \(1\) Segmentary "theory" alleges that in a segmentary lineage
    system any important social and political relations are explicable
    in terms of lineage affiliation. Cleavages, alliances, feuds, mutual
    aid are all determined by lineage affiliation. This emphasis
    overlooks other types of social relationships which can be equally
    important and often override an individual's or group's lineage
    obligations. These relationships include community membership,
    fnendsh1p, ne1ghborhood and affinal ties, relationships with one's
    mother's kin, and relationships of work and economic enterprise.
    Lineages, then, are not the solitary, close knit corporate bodies
    claimed by the theory.

    \(2\) In segmentary "theory" it is held that opposition arises
    between segments of the same level, that is, a major lineage opposes
    another major lineage but never a minor or minimal lineage. The
    theory also argues that the complementary segments are approximately
    equal in strength. But there are too many exceptions to these
    points, especially to the latter, for them to be accepted as
    invariable characteristics of the segmentary lineage.

    \(3\) Presumably membership in a lineage within the segmentary
    system is based exclusively upon kin ties through males and to a
    common male ancestor. In fact, there is often manipulation and
    jockeying with genealogies so that some individuals who are not so
    related are absorbed into the lineage. Aside from these kinds of
    fictions, the alleged common male ancestor is sometimes also only an
    invention. In sum we may say that the segmentary "theory" presents a
    people's ideology about their social system, an ideology which is
    only imperfectly reflected in their everyday life and which
    therefore clearly tells only a biased story.
