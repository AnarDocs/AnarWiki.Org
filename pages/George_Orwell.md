# George Orwell

**Eric Arthur Blair** (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), known by his pen
name **George Orwell**, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist
and critic. While never formally identifying as an anarchist, Orwell
maintained close connections with anarchist movements throughout his
life, fought alongside anarcho-syndicalists during the Spanish Civil
War, and at times described himself as a "Tory anarchist." His work
remains influential within anarchist circles, particularly his
first-hand account of the anarchist revolution in Catalonia.

## Early Political Development

Born into what he described as a "lower-upper-middle class" family,
Orwell's political awakening came through his experiences as an Imperial
Police officer in Burma. His disgust with imperialism and his
observations of colonial oppression led him to resign in 1928 and pursue
writing. His early works exploring poverty in Paris and London revealed
a writer concerned with exposing the realities of working-class life and
the failures of capitalist society.

## The Spanish Revolution

Orwell's experiences in Spain during the Civil War proved
transformative. Arriving in Barcelona in December 1936, he witnessed the
anarcho-syndicalist revolution that had transformed the city. In his
essential work *Homage to Catalonia*, he described the revolutionary
atmosphere:

> Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers
> and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the
> Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and
> with the initials of the revolutionary parties ... All this was queer
> and moving. There was much in it that I did not understand, in some
> ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a
> state of affairs worth fighting for.[^1]

Though he joined the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification)
militia due to his Independent Labour Party connections, Orwell
expressed clear sympathy for the anarchists. He wrote:

> As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to
> join the Anarchists.[^2]

He praised the anarchist militias as the most effective fighters among
non-foreign troops in loyalist Spain.

### Revolutionary Society

Orwell's description of the anarcho-syndicalist transformation of
Barcelona remains one of the most widely-read positive accounts of a
working-class revolution. He observed that in the militia, there existed
"a sort of microcosm of a classless society" where "no one was on the
make" and there was "no privilege and no boot-licking."[^3]

His writings on revolutionary Barcelona were later used by anarchist
publications, including Sam and Esther Dolgoff's *Views and Comments*,
to illustrate what an anarchist society could look like in practice.[^4]

## The May Days and Political Awakening

The May Days of 1937, when Communist forces and police attacked
anarchist and POUM positions in Barcelona, proved a crucial turning
point. Orwell witnessed firsthand the Communist betrayal of the
revolution. Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri was murdered by Communists
during this period. The subsequent suppression of the POUM and
anarchists, and the lies told about these events in the Communist press,
profoundly affected Orwell's political outlook.

He wrote that the subsequent "campaign of lies and distortion carried
out by the Communist press" had a dramatic effect on him, cementing his
opposition to Stalinism while maintaining his commitment to
socialism.[^5]

## Anarchist Connections

Throughout his life, Orwell maintained close friendships with
anarchists. After returning from Spain, he became involved with the
anarchist movement in Britain, including:

- Joining the International Anti-Fascist Solidarity Committee
  (Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista) in 1938, introduced to him by
  Emma Goldman[^6]
- Supporting the anarchist magazine *Revolt*, which emphasized the
  Spanish Civil War from an anarchist perspective
- Writing for anarchist publications, including George Woodcock's
  magazine *Now*, which published "How the Poor Die"
- Contributing to Alex Comfort's *New Road*, which published four parts
  of his essay "Looking Back on the Spanish War"

His friendship with anarchist writer George Woodcock was particularly
significant. Woodcock later wrote the influential biography *The Crystal
Spirit: A Study of George Orwell*, which remains an important anarchist
perspective on Orwell's work and thought.

## "Tory Anarchist"

During his *Adelphi* days, Orwell described himself as a
"Tory-anarchist," a seemingly contradictory self-identification that
reflected his complex political position.[^7][^8] This orientation
combined traditional English values with a fundamental opposition to
authority and hierarchy.

## Core Anarchist Values

Anarchist writer Raymond S. Solomon identified three core values that
Orwell shared with anarchism:

**Mutual Aid:** In *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, Orwell wrote of the proles
that they "were not loyal to an idea, party or country. They were loyal
to one another." This emphasis on mutual aid and solidarity reflected
anarchist principles.

**Egalitarianism:** What attracted Orwell to the Spanish anarchist-POUM
society was equality. Before the revolution was betrayed in *Animal
Farm*, one of the seven commandments was "All Animals Are Equal."

**Respect for the Individual:** Orwell's essay "The Prevention of
Literature" is a defense of individual thought, expression, freedom, and
development. In *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, he narrated the individual
rebellions of Julia and Winston Smith against totalitarian control.[^9]

## Defence of Imprisoned Anarchists

In 1945, Orwell demonstrated solidarity with imprisoned anarchists when
editors of the anarchist newspaper *War Commentary* (later *Freedom*)
were arrested under emergency laws. Among those arrested were Orwell's
friends Vernon Richards and Marie Louise Berneri. Despite disagreeing
with their anti-war stance, Orwell actively supported their defence and
worked to secure their release.

As Raymond Solomon wrote: "Orwell could be critical of anarchists, but
when the chips were down, he stood by the imprisoned anarchists standing
trial for their anti-war activities."[^10]

## The Controversy: Orwell's List

The most controversial aspect of Orwell's legacy concerns a list of 38
names he provided in 1949 to Celia Kirwan, who worked for the
Information Research Department (IRD), a semi-secret government
propaganda unit. This list identified people Orwell considered
"crypto-communists" or "fellow travellers" unsuitable for writing
anti-Soviet propaganda.

The list has been used by some to brand Orwell a "reactionary snitch"
and "counter-revolutionary."[^11] However, the context requires
examination from an anarchist perspective.

### Context and Justifications

Defenders of Orwell note several factors:

- The list was compiled when Orwell was dying of tuberculosis and may
  have affected his judgment
- It was provided to help select writers for anti-totalitarian
  propaganda, not for persecution
- Orwell wanted democratic socialists, not right-wingers, writing this
  material
- Several people on the list (Peter Smollett, Tom Driberg) were later
  confirmed as actual Soviet agents
- Unlike McCarthy-era blacklisting in America, those listed suffered no
  significant consequences
- The list was given during the Cold War when Soviet totalitarianism was
  swallowing Eastern Europe

Historian Timothy Garton Ash noted the "asymmetry of our attitudes
toward Nazism and communism," asking whether anyone would object if
Orwell had provided a list of closet Nazis.[^12]

### Anarchist Critiques

From an anarchist perspective, however, the list remains problematic:

- It involved cooperation with state security apparatus
- The IRD evolved into a "dirty tricks department" engaged in character
  assassination
- Some annotations showed prejudice (labeling people as "Polish Jew" or
  "English Jew")
- It contradicted Orwell's own warnings about state surveillance in
  *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
- It represented collaboration with the British state against fellow
  leftists

Vernon Richards and other anarchist friends maintained their respect for
Orwell despite this controversy, suggesting the complexity of the man
cannot be reduced to this single action.[^13]

## Legacy and Influence

Despite the controversy over the list, Orwell's influence on anarchist
thought remains significant:

### Literary Contributions

His works continue to be widely read within anarchist circles:

- *Homage to Catalonia* remains essential reading for understanding the
  Spanish Revolution
- *Animal Farm* is interpreted as a critique of how revolutions can be
  betrayed, not a rejection of revolution itself
- *Nineteen Eighty-Four* is read as a warning against all forms of
  totalitarianism, not just socialism
- His essays on politics and language continue to influence anarchist
  analysis

### Political Insights

Orwell wrote that every line of serious work since 1936 had been written
"directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic
socialism."[^14] His understanding that revolutions require the masses
to "chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their job"
resonates with anarchist principles of direct democracy and opposition
to vanguardism.

Vernon Richards observed that Orwell understood freedom and wrote about
the working class with genuine sympathy, even when his middle-class
background sometimes showed.[^15]

### Core Message

Colin Ward identified Orwell's ultimate message as: "Stay human: love
one another." Ward called this "the most important message of all,"
noting it was "not revolutionary, not political, not even original. But
it is the most important message of all."[^16]

## Assessment

George Orwell was, as Raymond Solomon concluded, "as close to being an
Anarchist as one could without actually being one."[^17] His objection
to anarchism centred on the concern that a society run by public opinion
could be as tyrannical as one based on physical force. George Woodcock
responded that anarchists were equally opposed to both forms of tyranny.

Orwell's lack of familiarity with anarchist theory and history
(particularly Russian anarchism) limited his understanding of anarchist
solutions to the problems he identified. Nevertheless, his commitment to
equality, individual freedom, opposition to all forms of tyranny, and
his witness to the anarchist revolution in Spain make him a significant,
if complicated, figure in anarchist history.

What matters most is not whether Orwell perfectly embodied anarchist
principles, but that he fought alongside anarchists, witnessed their
achievements, defended them when imprisoned, and left the world a
powerful account of what a working-class revolution could achieve. As
Solomon wrote: "What difference does it make that Orwell was not an
anarchist? Orwell was close enough."[^18]
