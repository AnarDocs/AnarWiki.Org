Little Commonwealth was a home for delinquent and non-delinquent youth,
run by Homer Lane from 1913 to 1918 in Dorset, England.[^1]

From Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action [^2]:

> Homer Lane was the man who, years in advance of his time, started a
> community of boys and girls, sent to him by the courts, called the
> <a href="Little_Commonwealth" class="wikilink"
> title="Little Commonwealth">Little Commonwealth</a>. He used to
> declare that 'Freedom cannot be given. It is taken by the child in
> discovery and invention.' True to this principle, says Howard Jones,
> 'he refused to impose upon the children a system of government copied
> from the institutions of the adult world. The self-governing structure
> of the Little Commonwealth was evolved by the children themselves,
> slowly and painfully, to satisfy their own needs.'"
