***The Anarchist Library*** is an online anarchist library and archive
founded around 2007 by Aragorn!, Marco and other anarchists. The project
is donation driven, volunteer run and no element of the site is
pay-walled. The far-reaching goal is to gather almost all quality
English-language anarchist literature and anarchist literature
translated into English, with an emphasis on collecting primitivist &
other forms of anti-technological texts.

Through collecting thousands of publications related to anarchism and
uniformizing the formatting, it hopes to create a nicer reader
experience for people who don't want to have to read for example badly
photo scanned zines, plus to challenge the monopoly of publishing houses
by offering free access to many copyrighted documents.

While valued for its accessibility and for being mostly a pluralist
project, it has drawn criticism for the archiving ethos skewing towards
including some anti-tech and anti-leftist writings authored by people
who see themselves as in conflict with anarchists. Plus, rejecting some
texts which critique these anti-tech & anti-left ideologues. Also,
whilst the open-submission model helps with acquiring 1000s of texts,
this sometimes leads to editorial oversight, where in some cases uploads
contain errors or are incomplete.

## History

The online library was founded by Aragorn!, Marco and other anarchists
around 2007.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5] Another anarchist website that preceded
the library and competed for significance was An Anarchist FAQ which
praised collective action and downplayed the importance of individualist
anarchism.[^6] So, Aragorn! and others ran The Anarchist Library
partially to push back against this tendency by opening the boundaries
of what anarchism meant to include anti-tech individualists like Ted
Kaczynski and Individualists Tending to the Wild (ITS) who neither
showed signs of really understanding anarchist history or ideas and
acted in conflict with anarchists projects.[^7][^8][^9] This reached a
breaking point in 2018 when out of embarrassment with some of these
texts being archived and being unable to convince the other librarians
to stop publishing them, one of the original founders Marco and others
left to establish another project, seeking a multiplicity of small
anarchist libraries rather than a single one.[^10][^11]

Enthusiasm to work on the website can also be traced back broadly to an
enthusiasm on the left for book clubs and library cataloguing.[^12]
Organizing a library on the internet for discussing niche ideology was
especially valuable for those people who lived very rurally or who are
disabled.[^13]

The project had archived 7,000 texts by 2020,[^14] and by July 2025, it
had expanded to include 16,000.[^15]

## Goals and organization

It aims to collect a wide variety of anarchist publications, plus some
texts related to anarchism in English, and to enable the establishment
of archival work for anarchist textual resources such as new
translations.[^16] The library takes particular pride in archiving texts
on contemporary anarchism[^17], primitivism and anti-technology
ideology.[^18][^19][^20][^21][^22]

## Legacy

### Influence(s)

This project has helped in the creation of many other language anarchist
libraries such as the *Southeast Asian Anarchist Library*.[^23]

Fairmont University recommends *The Anarchist Library* as a useful
resource for studying anarchism.[^24] Its collection of texts related to
the Spanish Civil War was noted by the anarchist newspaper *Fifth
Estate*.[^25] In 2019, Ruth Kinna noted the library as a 'reference
work' on contemporary anarchist thought.[^26]

The library is also credited by Luke Ray Di Marco Campbell, lecturer at
the University of Glasgow,[^27] for flouting copyrighted laws and thus
challenging the monopoly of the publishing industry.[^28]

### Criticisms and internal debates

Some of the texts present on the website are criticized for being
inaccurately transcribed or incomplete when compared to special
collections archives.[^29] According to *The Anarchist Library* itself,
editors attempt to achieve the most correct state of texts possible, but
this is a time-consuming process.[^30]

In 2018, internal conflicts arose within *The Anarchist Library* over
its inclusion of texts by Individualists Tending to the Wild (ITS) and
debates about whether such content should be included, or if so, whether
long warning notes should at least be added at the top.[^31][^32]
Critics argue that the editorial collective places disproportionate
emphasis on anti-technology writings at the expense of other anarchist
perspectives.[^33][^34][^35][^36][^37][^38] They contend that this
focus, particularly in a project that identifies as an anarchist
archive, risks legitimizing authoritarian ideologies and blurring the
distinction between anarchists and their
opponents.[^39][^40][^41][^42][^43][^44]

Di Marco Campbell argues it's nice that anarchists have desired put so
much time into archiving all these English language anarchist texts,
however because of colonial legacies and structural inequalities in
global publishing it'd also be nice if more people with the time and
resources put the effort into learning another language and archiving
other language anarchist texts, then more other language people could
engage with anarchist ideas and join the discussion.[^45] The reliance
on unpaid labor and the absence of commercial incentives often mean that
speakers of less globally dominant languages must either translate texts
themselves or resort to reading in English or French—languages
historically privileged through colonial and economic dominance.[^46]
While The Anarchist Library hosts materials in over two dozen languages,
Campbell notes that linguistic disparities persist, and that the burden
of addressing them often falls on under-resourced communities.[^47]
