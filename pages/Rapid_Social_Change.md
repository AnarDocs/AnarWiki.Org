# Rapid Social Change

## Overview

A common objection to anarchism is that the transformation of society
would take so long as to be practically impossible — that centuries of
hierarchy cannot be undone in a human lifetime, let alone within the
span of a revolutionary moment. The historical record does not support
this claim. Measured change in technology adoption, social attitudes,
legal structures, and political organisation repeatedly shows that what
appears fixed can shift within years or decades, and that under the
right conditions — particularly the collapse of existing institutions —
change can be near-instantaneous.

This article collects evidence of rapid change across several domains:
shifting public opinion, changes in everyday behaviour, and structural
transformations in governance and economic organisation. The aim is not
to argue that anarchist transformation is inevitable or easy, but to
challenge the assumption that it is inherently slow.

## Technology Adoption

Technology adoption offers the clearest quantitative evidence of rapid
change. The pattern is consistent: slow initial uptake, then a steep
rise, then a plateau. What is striking is that the steepness of the
curve has increased with each generation of technology.

Television went from 1% of US households in 1948 to 65% by 1955 — a rise
of 64 percentage points in seven years — reaching 90% by 1960.[^1] The
car followed a similar curve over a longer period: Henry Ford's assembly
line collapsed the cost of a Model T from \$600 in 1913 to below \$300
by 1927, and the US went from around 8,000 registered vehicles in 1900
to a society structurally organised around the automobile within thirty
years.[^2]

Home computers in the UK went from 13% of households in 1985 to around
80% by 2012, with the critical inflection point in the mid-1990s when
the internet transformed computers from expensive hobbyist equipment
into perceived necessities.[^3] Smartphones followed faster still: the
iPhone launched in 2007, and by 2024 smartphone ownership among 18–24
year olds in the UK had reached 100%.[^4]

The fastest consumer technology adoption on record is ChatGPT, which
reached one million users in five days after its November 2022 launch
and 100 million users within two months — a rate that UBS analysts
described as something they had not seen in twenty years of following
the internet sector.[^5] By comparison, Instagram took two and a half
years to reach 100 million users.

The relevance for anarchists is not primarily technological. It is that
these figures demolish any assumption that large-scale social change
requires generations. When conditions are right, transformation across
an entire society can happen within months.

## Shifts in Social Attitudes

Public opinion on contested moral and political questions shows a
comparable pattern, though typically over longer timescales. The data
below draws primarily on Gallup, YouGov, Pew Research Center, and the
British Social Attitudes Survey.

### Gay Marriage

Support for same-sex marriage in the United States stood at 27% in 1996.
By 2011 it had crossed 50% for the first time, and by 2021 it had
reached 70%.[^6] The shift was not primarily a matter of older opponents
dying and younger supporters replacing them — polling showed that
majorities within every age group moved upward, suggesting a genuine
change of mind rather than generational replacement alone.

Ireland moved faster. Homosexuality was only decriminalised in 1993, but
by 2015 — when Ireland became the first country to legalise same-sex
marriage by popular referendum — the yes vote was 62%. Support had been
below 30% as recently as 2000.[^7] The speed of change in a country
defined by Catholic social teaching for most of the twentieth century is
particularly instructive.

The United Kingdom crossed 50% support around 2009 and reached 70% by
2012–13, two years before legalisation in 2014.[^8]

### Interracial Marriage

In 1958, only 4% of Americans approved of marriage between Black and
white people. Approval crossed 50% around 1994, and reached 94% by the
early 2020s — the largest absolute swing recorded on any attitude
question in continuous Gallup polling.[^9] Over roughly 65 years, a
near-universal taboo became a near-universal norm.

### Smoking Bans

The fastest shift in the attitude tables is the Scottish smoking ban. In
spring 2004, only 39% of Scottish adults supported a comprehensive ban
in enclosed public spaces. By late 2005 — before the ban even came into
force in March 2006 — support had reached around 70%.[^10] Political
leadership preceded and drove opinion rather than following it. Scotland
introduced the ban; England followed in 2007.

### Corporal Punishment of Children

Sweden banned the physical punishment of children in 1979, at a time
when a majority of parents still practised it. Within roughly a
generation, opinion had reversed completely and physical punishment had
become culturally marginal.[^11] England is currently at an earlier
stage of the same process: 71% of the general public say smacking is
unacceptable (2024), but parental opinion and the law have not yet moved
to match.[^12] It is a live test of whether legislation leads or follows
cultural change.

## The Union Paradox

Trade union membership in the UK peaked at around 55% of the workforce
in 1979 and has fallen to around 22% overall — and 12% in the private
sector — by the early 2020s, with the sharpest falls during the Thatcher
years.[^13] The US has seen an even longer decline, from around 35% in
the 1950s to roughly 10% today, with private sector density at 6%.[^14]

What makes this politically interesting is that US public approval of
trade unions reached 71% in 2023 — the highest since the 1960s — at the
same time as membership continues to fall.[^15] Sympathy is rising while
participation is collapsing. This is not evidence that union decline is
natural or inevitable; it is evidence that structural barriers can
suppress behaviour even when underlying attitudes are favourable — and,
by implication, that removing those barriers could release latent
support rapidly.

## Revolutionary Structural Change

The examples above concern gradual shifts measured in years or decades.
There are also cases of near-instantaneous structural transformation,
where existing institutions collapse and new ones fill the space within
days or weeks.

### Revolutionary Catalonia

When Franco's military coup was defeated in Barcelona on 19 July 1936,
the result was not simply a military victory for the Republic. The
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink"
title="defeat of the coup">defeat of the coup</a> produced a power
vacuum in which the <a href="CNT" class="wikilink" title="CNT">CNT</a>,
which had around one million members in Catalonia, moved to collectivise
the economy. Within days to weeks, roughly 75% of the Catalan economy
was under worker control — factories, transport, hotels, restaurants,
and barber shops organised through worker committees.[^16] Across Spain
as a whole, between 1.8 and 3 million people lived and worked in
agricultural or industrial collectives.[^17]

The transformation was not only economic. George Orwell, arriving in
Barcelona in December 1936, wrote that it was the first time he had ever
been in a town where the working class was in the saddle — visible in
clothing, manner, and speech, with formal address replaced by the
familiar *tú* and tipping abolished as demeaning.[^18]

This transformation was possible because the CNT had spent decades
building organisational infrastructure before the crisis came. When the
existing structures collapsed, there was something to fill the space
immediately. The experiment lasted roughly ten months before Stalinist
counter-revolution and Republican state consolidation reversed it from
mid-1937.

### Rojava

When the Assad regime withdrew its forces from northeastern Syria in
2012, the
<a href="Democratic_Federation_of_Northern_Syria" class="wikilink"
title="Democratic Confederation of Northern Syria">Democratic
Confederation of Northern Syria</a> (commonly known as
<a href="Rojava" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a>) began
building new institutions based on
<a href="Democratic_Confederalism" class="wikilink"
title="democratic confederalism">democratic confederalism</a> — the
political theory developed by Abdullah Öcalan in prison drawing on
Murray Bookchin's <a href="Libertarian_Municipalism" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian municipalism">libertarian municipalism</a>.

Within roughly two years, functioning governance had been established
across three cantons, including co-leadership requirements (one man and
one woman mandatory at every level of every administrative body), a 40%
women's quota across all organisations, women-only courts for cases of
sexual violence and domestic abuse, and mandatory feminist education for
all security forces before receiving weapons.[^19][^20] Women comprised
around 40% of the YPG/YPJ militia.

This is arguably the fastest implementation of a comprehensive feminist
governance structure on record — in an active war zone, in a society
that had until recently been governed by conservative tribal and
Ba'athist patriarchal structures. As with Catalonia, decades of
ideological groundwork (Öcalan's prison writings from 2005 to 2011, the
PKK's thirty-year organisational history) preceded the explosive
implementation made possible by institutional collapse.

## Ancient Evidence: Teotihuacan

The case for rapid structural change is not limited to the modern
period.
<a href="David_Graeber" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a> and
<a href="David_Wengrow" class="wikilink" title="David Wengrow">David
Wengrow</a>, in *<a href="The_Dawn_of_Everything" class="wikilink"
title="The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity">The Dawn of
Everything: A New History of Humanity</a>* (2021), point to the
archaeological evidence from <a href="Teotihuacan" class="wikilink"
title="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> in central Mexico as particularly
striking.[^21]

Teotihuacan flourished from roughly 100 BCE to 550 CE, at its peak
housing perhaps 100,000 people — one of the largest cities in the world
at the time. Its early centuries show clear evidence of hierarchy:
monumental pyramid complexes, evidence of ritual sacrifice, and
high-status burials suggesting a ruling class.

Around 300–350 CE, the temple-palace complexes associated with rulers
were burned — apparently deliberately, from within the city rather than
by external invaders. After this, the city continued for another two
centuries, but the material record changes substantially. Investment
shifted from monumental elite structures to large residential apartment
compounds of broadly similar quality across neighbourhoods. There is
evidence of centralised provision of services to these residential
areas, no clear ruler burials or elite tombs, and a more distributed
pattern of feasting and social life.

Graeber and Wengrow read this as a deliberate political act — a
revolution — and use it as evidence that large, complex urban societies
do not require centralised authoritarian rule, and that hierarchy is not
a one-way ratchet. The evidence is contested among archaeologists, and
motivations cannot be read directly from material remains. But the basic
sequence — deliberate destruction of elite structures followed by a long
period of apparently more equal urban organisation — is reasonably
well-established in the archaeological record.

The implication is that this kind of transformation has happened before,
and that it can persist: the post-revolutionary phase at Teotihuacan
lasted not months but centuries.

## Patterns and Conditions

Several patterns emerge from the evidence above.

The speed of change correlates with two factors: the depth of prior
organisational preparation, and the existence of a crisis that dissolves
existing structures. The CNT had a million members in Catalonia before
1936; Öcalan had been developing democratic confederalism for thirty
years before Assad withdrew. The opinion shifts in liberal democracies
happen more gradually precisely because the institutions remain intact
and must be changed from within or eroded over time. When institutions
collapse — through military defeat, state withdrawal, or deliberate
popular action — prepared organisations can fill the space at
extraordinary speed.

Law can also lead rather than follow opinion. The Swedish corporal
punishment ban passed when a majority still practised smacking; within a
generation, practice and opinion had reversed. The Scottish smoking ban
was announced when fewer than 40% supported it; within eighteen months,
70% did. This has implications for how anarchists think about
prefigurative politics and the relationship between institutional change
and cultural change.

The most significant historical pattern, however, is the one Graeber and
Wengrow identify at the largest scale: that human societies have
repeatedly made conscious choices to organise themselves differently,
and that the assumption of inevitable hierarchy is not supported by the
evidence. What we call "human nature" has consistently proved more
flexible than its defenders claim.
