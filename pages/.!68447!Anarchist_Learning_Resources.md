This list gives a basic learning and organising guide:[^1]

## Learn something, learn everything, learn nothing

Knowledge is both power and protection, but it must be balanced with
practical experience and critical thinking. Understanding history,
theory, and skills helps us avoid repeating mistakes and recognise
patterns as they emerge. However, we must remain flexible in our
thinking and learn through direct experience rather than just books.

**Learn Something:**

- Study core resistance theory and successful movements
- Master essential practical skills (first aid, encryption, growing
  food)
- Learn your local area (resources, community needs)

**Learn Everything:**

- Read widely across movements, history, and even speculative fiction
- Develop diverse practical skills and organizational approaches
- Build understanding of interconnected struggles and systems

**Learn Nothing:**

- Question propaganda and official narratives
- Learn through direct experience rather than just theory
- Stay flexible and avoid dogmatic thinking

**Learning Suggestion:** **Join / start a radical book / movie club**

- Find if one already exists and support it - in person or online
- Start one - Find a local radical venue, a library or community centre,
  a café, or just use your home
- Advertise your group online and IRL - meetup, Facebook, flyers,
  posters, convincing friends to come along
- Pick books to read / movies to watch between you

## Do something, do everything, do nothing

Action gives meaning to knowledge and builds real-world capability.
Getting involved in community projects and dual power / prefiguration
initiatives creates networks of support and resistance before they’re
desperately needed. However, strategic inaction is sometimes as
important as action - knowing when to step back, when to rest, and - if
already in a dystopia - when to remain invisible.

**Do Something:**

- Join focused local groups (mutual aid projects, community gardens)
- Take direct action on specific causes you care about
- Join a syndicalist union or similar worker organization

**Do Everything:**

- Be active in multiple community groups, especially neighbourhood ones
- Support various strikes and protests
- Participate in different mutual aid initiatives

**Do Nothing:**

- Avoid groups that might morally compromise you
- Know when to step back to prevent burnout
- Stay under the radar when the situation requires it

**Doing Suggestion 1:** **Start / Join An Assembly**

- Find or create a regular neighbourhood meeting space
- Start with small issues that affect local people
- Practice consensus decision making
- Build connections between different local groups and issues
- Create working groups for specific projects

Here is [Crimethinc’s in depth guide to
Assemblies](https://crimethinc.com/2024/11/10/how-to-organize-an-assembly-preparing-to-respond-to-an-era-of-disasters-and-despotism)
& [Extinction Rebellion’s
one](https://extinctionrebellion.uk/act-now/resources/peoples-assemblies/)

**Doing Suggestion 2:** **Community Garden Project**

- Find unused land or join existing garden / food co-op
  </li>
- Learn growing skills and share produce
  </li>
- Build food independence while creating community bonds
  </li>
- Network with other local gardens and food projects
