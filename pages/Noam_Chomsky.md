linguistics while simultaneously developing a radical critique of power
structures that has made him one of the world's most prominent
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
voices.

However, Chomsky has faced criticism from some anarchists for his
concept of "legitimate hierarchy," his participation in liberal
electoral politics, and his willingness to engage with figures of state
and corporate power. His relationship with convicted sex offender
Jeffrey Epstein has been cited by critics as an example of why anarchism
should reject authority figures and leadership hierarchies within the
movement itself.

## Life

### Family

Noam's parents were immigrants to the USA from Eastern Europe. His
mother, Elsie Simonofsky, came from Belarus in 1906, while his father,
William Chomsky, left Ukraine for the USA in 1913 and became an
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="IWW">IWW</a> member at some point.[^1] William placed great
emphasis on educating people to be "well integrated, free and
independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing
the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and
worthwhile for all," a mission that deeply influenced his son.[^2]

### Early Life

Born in Philadelphia, Chomsky was intellectually curious and competitive
from an early age. He was raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and
regularly discussing Zionism, particularly influenced by the Left
Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am. As a Jew, Chomsky faced antisemitism as
a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in
Philadelphia.[^3]

Chomsky has described his parents as "normal Roosevelt Democrats" with
center-left politics, but relatives involved in the International
Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left
politics.[^4][^5] His uncle in New York City ran a newspaper stand where
Jewish leftists would gather to debate current affairs, providing young
Chomsky with early exposure to radical politics.[^6][^7]

He became absorbed in the story of the 1939 fall of Barcelona and
suppression of the Spanish anarchosyndicalist movement, writing his
first article on the topic at age 10.[^8][^9] That he came to identify
with anarchism rather than another leftist movement, he described as a
"lucky accident."[^10] Chomsky was firmly anti-Bolshevik by his early
teens.[^11]

### University Years

In 1945, at age 16, Chomsky began studying at the University of
Pennsylvania, exploring philosophy, logic, and languages. Living at
home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[^12]
Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered
dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[^13] but
his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the
linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947.

In 1947, Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz,
whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[^14][^15]

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of
the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored
with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced
Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical
liberalism.[^16][^17] Chomsky also read works by anarchists Mikhail
Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santillán, democratic socialists George
Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and writings by Marxists
Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg.[^18] His politics were
reaffirmed by Orwell's depiction of Barcelona's functioning anarchist
society in Homage to Catalonia (1938).[^19]

### Political Activities

Chomsky's political activism gained prominence during the Vietnam War.
In 1967, his essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals" catapulted him
to national attention as a leading anti-war voice. He refused to pay
half his taxes, supported draft resisters, and was arrested while
participating in an anti-war teach-in outside the
Pentagon.[^20][^21][^22] During this period, Chomsky co-founded the
anti-war collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov,
William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald.[^23][^24][^25]

His anti-war activities led to multiple arrests, and he was placed on
President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents.[^26][^27] Despite
the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, Chomsky continued
his activism, aware that his scientific reputation at MIT provided some
protection from administrative action based on his beliefs.[^28]

Throughout subsequent decades, Chomsky has remained a steadfast critic
of US imperialism, corporate capitalism, and state power. He has been
particularly vocal about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US
interventions in Latin America, and the corporate capture of democratic
institutions. He supported the 2011 Occupy movement, viewing it as a
reaction to what he termed a 30-year class war.[^29]

After suffering a stroke in 2023, Chomsky moved to Brazil full-time,
where he continues to follow current events despite being unable to walk
or communicate as before.[^30]

### Controversies

#### Anarchist Critiques

Despite his prominence as an anarchist theorist, Chomsky has faced
sustained criticism from sections of the anarchist movement centered on
his concept of "legitimate hierarchy" and his engagement with liberal
politics.

Chomsky's notion of "legitimate hierarchy" has been particularly
controversial among anarchists. He has argued that hierarchies can be
legitimate if those subject to them can justify their existence, placing
the burden of proof on authority to demonstrate its necessity. Critics
argue this fundamentally contradicts anarchist principles by allowing
for justifications of authority that anarchism explicitly rejects.
Anti-authoritarian theorists contend that any framework permitting
"justified" hierarchy creates openings for the perpetuation of
domination, as those wielding power will always find ways to rationalize
their position.

His participation in liberal electoral politics has also drawn
criticism. Chomsky has regularly advocated for voting for Democratic
candidates in swing states, characterizing this as harm reduction. Many
anarchists view this as legitimizing state power and contradicting
anarchist principles of direct action and building alternative
institutions rather than engaging with existing power structures.
Critics argue that his advocacy for lesser-evil voting diverts energy
from revolutionary organizing and reinforces the false choice between
two wings of what he himself calls the "Business Party."

Post-left anarchists and insurrectionists have been particularly
critical of what they see as Chomsky's reformist approach, arguing that
his focus on critique of state policy rather than direct confrontation
with power represents a domesticated anarchism compatible with academic
respectability. They argue that genuine anarchist practice requires
rejection of engagement with institutional power, not reasoned dialogue
with it.

Some anarchists argue that Chomsky's prominent platform and treatment as
a spokesperson for anarchism contradicts the movement's
anti-hierarchical principles. They contend that anarchism should not
have figureheads or authorities whose pronouncements carry special
weight, as this recreates the very power dynamics anarchism seeks to
abolish. These critiques reflect broader tensions within anarchism
between different strategic orientations and the challenge of preventing
the recreation of hierarchy within ostensibly anti-hierarchical
movements.

#### Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein

Emails released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025
revealed that Chomsky maintained contact with convicted sex offender
Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein's 2008 conviction, continuing at least
through 2017.[^31] In correspondence, Chomsky described Epstein as a
"highly valued friend and regular source of intellectual exchange and
stimulation."[^32]

Documents released in December 2025 included a photograph of Chomsky
with Steve Bannon from Epstein's estate and another showing him
traveling on Epstein's private plane.[^33] Before these releases,
Chomsky acknowledged receiving approximately \$270,000 from an account
connected to Epstein, which he stated was related to managing common
funds after his first wife Carol's death.[^34]

Email exchanges from 2016 show Epstein inviting Chomsky and his second
wife Valeria to meet in New York or the Caribbean, with Chomsky
responding favorably about the Caribbean option.[^35] A 2019 message
suggested Epstein sought Chomsky's advice on handling media attention
following his 2008 plea deal, with advice attributed to Chomsky stating
the best approach was to ignore criticism, particularly given what was
characterized as "hysteria that has developed about abuse of women,
which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime
worse than murder."[^36]

Scholar Norman Finkelstein, commenting on these revelations in December
2025, noted that Chomsky "met and corresponded with everyone" without
discrimination, characterizing this as his standard practice. However,
Finkelstein expressed puzzlement over certain aspects of the
allegations, particularly an undated, unsigned, and unaddressed letter
supposedly written by Chomsky in support of Epstein, noting that "most
of the letter does not sound at all like him."[^37]

## Ideas

### Anarchism and Libertarian Socialism

Chomsky identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist and libertarian socialist,
seeing these positions as the descendants of classical liberal ideas of
the Age of Enlightenment.[^38][^39] His ideological position revolves
around "nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human
being."[^40]

He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of
the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would
select temporary and revocable representatives to meet together at
general assemblies.[^41] In Chomsky's view, the point of this
self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, "a
direct participator in the government of affairs."[^42] He believes
there would be no need for political parties in such a system.[^43]

By controlling their productive life, Chomsky argues that individuals
can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[^44]
He suggests that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated,
specially remunerated, or communally shared.[^45]

Chomsky emphasizes that his criticisms of state power extend to all
states, not just the United States. He has been a consistent critic of
Soviet authoritarianism, describing himself as "anti-Bolshevik" from an
early age. For Chomsky, the Soviet system represented a betrayal of
socialist ideals, replacing one form of authority (capitalism) with
another (state bureaucracy).

### Critique of Capitalism and State Power

Chomsky argues that capitalism and state power are deeply intertwined
systems of domination. He points out that since the 1970s, the US has
become more economically unequal following the repeal of various
financial regulations.[^46] He characterizes the US as a de facto
one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party
as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by corporate
and financial interests.[^47]

He emphasizes that within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at
least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions,
which are instead in the hands of a management class and controlled by a
small, wealthy elite.[^48] This concentration of economic power leads to
the corruption of political systems, as economic elites use their
resources to capture political institutions.

Despite his radical critique, Chomsky rejects violent revolution as a
means of social change, citing historical examples where the
population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[^49] Instead,
he advocates for the organized cooperation of large numbers of people
who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the
economy more equitably.[^50]

### Propaganda Model

Chomsky and Edward Herman analyzed western media output throughout the
1980s and identified five main factors behind media biases towards a
pro-corporate, pro-state outlook:

1\. **Ownership**: The expensive and increasing cost of producing media
ensures that only wealthy organizations will be able to afford it. Hence
media will not be critical of wealthy organizations as an institution.

2\. **Advertising**: Media production costs more than consumers will
pay, so advertisers pay for the costs, ensuring media will remain
uncritical of advertising as an institution. The specific companies
behind the advertising will not be criticized, and media content will
not make people too pessimistic or critical of consumerism.

3\. **Sourcing**: Media cannot afford to place reporters everywhere, and
therefore will put them in contact with places where the most
interesting news comes from (corporate or government offices). This
creates a dependency relationship where media outlets rely on official
sources.

4\. **Flak**: Business organizations regularly form "flak machines" to
spread confusion or mistrust in sources which actively criticize certain
things. This can take the form of letter-writing campaigns, lawsuits, or
formal complaints to regulatory bodies.

5\. **Ideology**: In order to maximize attention from viewers, media
will often exaggerate stories and create an atmosphere of fear. This
plays in with point 3, where enemies of the state—good or bad—will be
portrayed as inhuman monsters.

These five filters work together to ensure people have faith in the
government and corporations, or at least cannot conceive of an
alternative to them. This model explains why, despite the appearance of
a free press in liberal democracies, the media still largely serves
elite interests rather than functioning as a truly independent check on
power.

Chomsky argues that mainstream press is corporate-owned and reflects
corporate priorities and interests.[^51] Although mass media will
criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not
undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[^52] As
evidence, he points out that the U.S. mass media does not employ any
socialist journalists or political commentators.[^53]

### Anti-Imperialism

Chomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism throughout
his career.[^54] He believes that U.S. foreign policy's basic principle
is the establishment of "open societies" that are economically and
politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can
prosper.[^55]

He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these
countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that
U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[^56] When discussing
current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical
perspective.[^57] He believes that official, sanctioned historical
accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have
consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them
as having benevolent motives.[^58]

Chomsky's critiques extend to U.S. involvement in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he believes has consistently blocked
a peaceful settlement.[^59] He also criticizes U.S. close ties with
Saudi Arabia, noting that Saudi Arabia has "one of the most grotesque
human rights records in the world."[^60]

### Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

Chomsky's views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are rooted in his
anarchist principles opposing nationalism and state power. As a Jewish
intellectual who was once a labor Zionist, his evolution to anti-Zionism
has made his critique particularly significant.

Chomsky has criticized the Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank, which he likens to a settler colony.[^61] He has said that
the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a bad decision,
but given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a
two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on
equal terms.[^62][^63]

He has stated that characterizing Israel's treatment of the Palestinians
as apartheid, similar to the system that existed in South Africa, would
be a "gift to Israel," as he has long held that "the Occupied
Territories are much worse than South Africa."[^64] South Africa
depended on its black population for labor, but Chomsky argues the same
is not true of Israel, which in his view seeks to make the situation for
Palestinians under its occupation unlivable.[^65]

Chomsky has called the Israeli-led blockade of the Gaza Strip a
transformation of Gaza into a "concentration camp." His critique centers
on the fundamental contradiction of creating an ethno-nationalist state
within an anarchist framework that rejects the legitimacy of all states.
