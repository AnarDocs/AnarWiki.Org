voices.

## Life

### Family

Noam's parents were immigrants to the USA from Eastern Europe. His
mother, Elsie Simonofsky, came from Belarus in 1906, while his father,
William Chomsky, left Ukraine for the USA in 1913 and became an
"<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="IWW">IWW</a> member at some point.[^1] William placed great
emphasis on educating people to be "well integrated, free and
independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing
the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and
worthwhile for all," a mission that deeply influenced his son.[^2]

### Early Life

Born in Philadelphia, Chomsky was intellectually curious and competitive
from an early age. He was raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and
regularly discussing Zionism, particularly influenced by the Left
Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am. As a Jew, Chomsky faced antisemitism as
a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in
Philadelphia.[^3]

Chomsky has described his parents as "normal Roosevelt Democrats" with
center-left politics, but relatives involved in the International
Ladies' Garment Workers' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left
politics.[^4] His uncle in New York City ran a newspaper stand where
Jewish leftists would gather to debate current affairs, providing young
Chomsky with early exposure to radical politics.[^5]

He became absorbed in the story of the 1939 fall of Barcelona and
suppression of the Spanish anarchosyndicalist movement, writing his
first article on the topic at age 10.[^6] That he came to identify with
anarchism rather than another leftist movement, he described as a "lucky
accident."[^7] Chomsky was firmly anti-Bolshevik by his early teens.[^8]

### University Years

In 1945, at age 16, Chomsky began studying at the University of
Pennsylvania, exploring philosophy, logic, and languages. Living at
home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.[^9]
Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered
dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine,[^10] but
his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the
linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947.

In 1947, Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz,
whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949.[^11]

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of
the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored
with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced
Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism.[^12]
Chomsky also read works by anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de
Santillán, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and
Dwight Macdonald, and writings by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch,
and Rosa Luxemburg.[^13] His politics were reaffirmed by Orwell's
depiction of Barcelona's functioning anarchist society in Homage to
Catalonia (1938).[^14]

### Political Activities

Chomsky's political activism gained prominence during the Vietnam War.
In 1967, his essay "The Responsibility of Intellectuals" catapulted him
to national attention as a leading anti-war voice. He refused to pay
half his taxes, supported draft resisters, and was arrested while
participating in an anti-war teach-in outside the Pentagon.[^15] During
this period, Chomsky co-founded the anti-war collective RESIST with
Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight
Macdonald.[^16]

His anti-war activities led to multiple arrests, and he was placed on
President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents.[^17] Despite the
potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, Chomsky continued his
activism, aware that his scientific reputation at MIT provided some
protection from administrative action based on his beliefs.[^18]

Throughout subsequent decades, Chomsky has remained a steadfast critic
of US imperialism, corporate capitalism, and state power. He has been
particularly vocal about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US
interventions in Latin America, and the corporate capture of democratic
institutions. He supported the 2011 Occupy movement, viewing it as a
reaction to what he termed a 30-year class war.[^19]

After suffering a stroke in 2023, Chomsky moved to Brazil full-time,
where he continues to follow current events despite being unable to walk
or communicate as before.[^20]

## Ideas

### Anarchism and Libertarian Socialism

Chomsky identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist and libertarian socialist,
seeing these positions as the descendants of classical liberal ideas of
the Age of Enlightenment.[^21] His ideological position revolves around
"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human
being."[^22]

He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of
the means of production and government by workers' councils, who would
select temporary and revocable representatives to meet together at
general assemblies.[^23] In Chomsky's view, the point of this
self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson's words, "a
direct participator in the government of affairs."[^24] He believes
there would be no need for political parties in such a system.[^25]

By controlling their productive life, Chomsky argues that individuals
can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose.[^26]
He suggests that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated,
specially remunerated, or communally shared.[^27]

Chomsky emphasizes that his criticisms of state power extend to all
states, not just the United States. He has been a consistent critic of
Soviet authoritarianism, describing himself as "anti-Bolshevik" from an
early age. For Chomsky, the Soviet system represented a betrayal of
socialist ideals, replacing one form of authority (capitalism) with
another (state bureaucracy).

### Critique of Capitalism and State Power

Chomsky argues that capitalism and state power are deeply intertwined
systems of domination. He highlights that since the 1970s, the US has
become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of
various financial regulations.[^28] He characterizes the US as a de
facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic
Party as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by
corporate and financial interests.[^29]

He emphasizes that within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at
least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions,
which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately
controlled by a small, wealthy elite.[^30] This concentration of
economic power inevitably leads to the corruption of political systems,
as economic elites use their resources to capture political
institutions.

Despite his radical critique, Chomsky rejects violent revolution as a
means of social change, citing historical examples where the
population's welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.[^31] Instead,
he advocates for the organized cooperation of large numbers of people
who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the
economy more equitably.[^32]

### Propaganda Model

Chomsky and Edward Herman analyzed western media output throughout the
1980s and came to the conclusion that five main factors were behind
media biases towards a pro-corporate, pro-state outlook on the world:

1\. **Ownership**: The expensive and increasing cost of producing media
ensures that only wealthy organizations will be able to afford it. Hence
media will not be critical of wealthy organizations as an institution.

2\. **Advertising**: Media production costs more than consumers will
pay, so advertisers pay for the costs, ensuring media will remain
uncritical of advertising as an institution. The specific companies
behind the advertising will not be criticized, and media content will
not make people too pessimistic or critical of consumerism.

3\. **Sourcing**: Media cannot afford to place reporters everywhere, and
therefore will put them in contact with places where the most
interesting news comes from (i.e., corporate or government offices).
This creates a dependency relationship where media outlets rely on
official sources.

4\. **Flak**: Business organizations regularly form "flak machines" to
spread confusion or mistrust in sources which actively criticize certain
things. This can take the form of letter-writing campaigns, lawsuits, or
formal complaints to regulatory bodies.

5\. **Ideology**: In order to maximize attention from viewers, media
will often exaggerate stories and create an atmosphere of fear. This
plays in with point 3, where enemies of the state—good or bad—will be
portrayed as inhuman monsters.

These five filters play together to ensure people have faith in the
government and corporations, or at least cannot conceive of an
alternative to them. This model explains why, despite the appearance of
a free press in liberal democracies, the media still largely serves
elite interests rather than functioning as a truly independent check on
power.

Chomsky argues that mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus
reflects corporate priorities and interests.[^33] Although mass media
will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not
undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.[^34] As
evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any
socialist journalists or political commentators.[^35]

### Anti-Imperialism

Chomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism throughout
his career.[^36] He believes that U.S. foreign policy's basic principle
is the establishment of "open societies" that are economically and
politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can
prosper.[^37]

He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these
countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that
U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.[^38] When discussing
current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical
perspective.[^39] He believes that official, sanctioned historical
accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have
consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them
as having benevolent motives.[^40]

Chomsky's critiques extend to U.S. involvement in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he believes has consistently blocked
a peaceful settlement.[^41] He also criticizes U.S. close ties with
Saudi Arabia, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has "one of the most
grotesque human rights records in the world."[^42]

### Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

Chomsky's views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are deeply rooted in
his anarchist principles opposing nationalism and state power. As a
Jewish intellectual who was once a labor Zionist, his evolution to
anti-Zionism has made his critique particularly significant.

Chomsky has criticized the Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank, which he likens to a settler colony.[^43] He has said that
the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a bad decision,
but given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a
two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on
equal terms.[^44]

He has stated that characterizing Israel's treatment of the Palestinians
as apartheid, similar to the system that existed in South Africa, would
be a "gift to Israel," as he has long held that "the Occupied
Territories are much worse than South Africa."[^45] South Africa
depended on its black population for labor, but Chomsky argues the same
is not true of Israel, which in his view seeks to make the situation for
Palestinians under its occupation unlivable.[^46]

Chomsky has called the Israeli-led blockade of the Gaza Strip a
transformation of Gaza into a "concentration camp." His critique centers
on the fundamental contradiction of creating an ethno-nationalist state
within an anarchist framework that rejects the legitimacy of all states.
