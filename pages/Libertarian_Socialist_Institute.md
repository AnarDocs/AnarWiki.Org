The Libertarian Socialist Institute was an anarchistic, anti-colonial
institute in India in the 1940s. Its August 7, 1947 mission statement
declared, “Historically, governments are found to rest on force,
maintain injustice, curtail freedom, cause poverty and breed wars.” The
statement called for a classless society to be “worked for here and
now.” [^1]
