# Neoliberalism

**Neoliberalism** is a political and economic ideology that advocates
for free-market capitalism, deregulation, privatization, reduced
government spending on social programs, and the marketization of
previously public services.[^1] From an anarchist perspective,
neoliberalism represents an intensification of
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and state power, despite rhetoric about "freedom" and "small
government." It is characterized by the massive

of <a href="Trade_Union" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade

police and military powers to enforce market relations.

## Overview

Neoliberalism emerged as a conscious political project in the mid-20th
century, seeking to reshape society around market principles. While
neoliberals claim to oppose state intervention in the economy, in
practice neoliberal policies have required extensive state violence to
implement and maintain.[^2] The ideology redefines citizens as consumers
and competition as the organizing principle of all human relations, with
market mechanisms extended into areas previously considered non-economic
such as education, healthcare, and social relationships.

For anarchists, neoliberalism represents neither a reduction in state
power nor genuine economic freedom, but rather a reconfiguration of
state-capital relations that concentrates wealth and power while
attacking working-class organizations and collective solutions to social
problems.

## History

### Origins (1930s-1940s)

The term "neoliberalism" was coined at the Colloque Walter Lippmann in
Paris in 1938, attended by economists including
<a href="Friedrich_Hayek" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a> and Ludwig von Mises.[^3]
These thinkers sought to revive liberal economic thought in response to
the <a href="Great_Depression" class="wikilink"
title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, which had discredited
laissez-faire capitalism, and to counter the growth of social democracy,
communism, and fascism.

In 1947, Hayek founded the
<a href="Mont_Pelerin_Society" class="wikilink"
title="Mont Pelerin Society">Mont Pelerin Society</a>, bringing together
economists, businesspeople, and activists to develop and promote
neoliberal ideas.[^4] The society was funded by wealthy individuals and
foundations who saw in neoliberalism an opportunity to reduce regulation
and taxation. Over subsequent decades, neoliberal think tanks
proliferated, including the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and
Adam Smith Institute, all funded by corporate interests.

### Implementation (1970s-1980s)

Neoliberal policies remained marginal until economic crises in the 1970s
created opportunities for implementation. The first major experiment
occurred in <a href="Chile" class="wikilink" title="Chile">Chile</a>
following the 1973 military coup against democratically-elected
socialist president Salvador Allende. The dictatorship of Augusto
Pinochet, with support from the United States, implemented radical
free-market policies designed by the "Chicago Boys" - Chilean economists
trained under <a href="Milton_Friedman" class="wikilink"
title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> at the University of
Chicago.[^5] This included privatization, deregulation, crushing of
trade unions, and cuts to social spending. The Chilean experience
demonstrated that neoliberalism required authoritarian violence to
overcome popular resistance - a pattern repeated elsewhere.

In 1976, neoliberal policies began in Argentina under military
dictatorship, and in China under Deng Xiaoping's market reforms.

In 1979, <a href="Margaret_Thatcher" class="wikilink"
title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> became Prime Minister of
the
<a href="United_Kingdom" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">United
Kingdom</a>, implementing aggressive neoliberal policies including
privatization of state industries, attacks on trade unions (particularly
the miners' strike of 1984-85), deregulation of financial markets, and
cuts to social services.

Following Thatcher,
<a href="Ronald_Reagan" class="wikilink" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald
Reagan</a> became U.S. President in 1981, pursuing similar policies -
tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, union-busting (starting with the
air traffic controllers' strike), and increased military spending. The
Reagan and Thatcher governments popularized the phrase "there is no
alternative" (TINA) to market-based solutions.

### Global Spread (1980s-1990s)

Throughout the 1980s-1990s, neoliberal policies spread globally, often
imposed through international institutions:

In 1980, neoliberalism began in
<a href="Japan" class="wikilink" title="Japan">Japan</a> as the
government shifted focus from rural areas to Tokyo, reduced tariffs and
subsidies, expanded the working week, and raised the retirement age.

In 1983-1984, neoliberal "reforms" began in Australia and
<a href="New_Zealand" class="wikilink" title="New Zealand">New
Zealand</a>, with New Zealand's Labour government under
<a href="Roger_Douglas" class="wikilink" title="Roger Douglas">Roger
Douglas</a> implementing particularly radical free-market policies
(known as "Rogernomics") including privatization, deregulation, and
welfare cuts.

In 1985, neoliberalism began in
<a href="Brazil" class="wikilink" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

In 1988, neoliberal policies began in
<a href="Mexico" class="wikilink" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, leading to
the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

The <a href="International_Monetary_Fund" class="wikilink"
title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>
(IMF) and
<a href="World_Bank" class="wikilink" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>
imposed neoliberal "<a href="structural_adjustment" class="wikilink"
title="structural adjustment">structural adjustment</a>" programs on
developing countries as conditions for loans, requiring privatization,
deregulation, cuts to social spending, and opening to foreign
investment.[^6] These policies often led to increased poverty and
inequality while enriching foreign corporations and local elites.

The "Washington Consensus" of the 1990s codified neoliberal orthodoxy:
fiscal discipline, reduced public expenditure, tax reform, financial
liberalization, competitive exchange rates, trade liberalization,
openness to foreign investment, privatization, deregulation, and
property rights.

### 21st Century

The 2008 financial crisis, caused largely by deregulated financial
markets, temporarily challenged neoliberal hegemony. However,
governments responded not by abandoning neoliberalism but by
implementing "austerity" - cutting public spending while bailing out
banks and corporations. This demonstrated that neoliberalism socializes
costs while privatizing profits.

Neoliberal policies have continued through various "free trade"
agreements that give corporations power to sue governments over
regulations that affect profits, through the expansion of the "gig
economy" and precarious work, and through the continued privatization
and marketization of public services.

## Key Features

### Free Market Fundamentalism

Neoliberals argue that free markets are the most efficient means of
organizing economic activity and that market mechanisms should be
extended to all areas of life.[^7] They oppose central planning and most
government intervention in markets, though they support strong property
rights and contract enforcement.

### Privatization

Neoliberal programs systematically transfer public assets and services
to private ownership - from utilities and transportation to education
and healthcare. This creates new opportunities for profit extraction
from essential services while reducing democratic control.

### Deregulation

Neoliberals advocate removing regulations on business, particularly
environmental protections, labor standards, and financial controls. In
practice, this means freedom for corporations to externalize costs onto
workers, communities, and ecosystems.

### Anti-Union Policies

Neoliberalism requires weakening or destroying trade unions and
collective bargaining, redefining them as "market distortions." This has
been accomplished through legislation restricting union activities,
police repression of strikes, and promoting precarious employment that
makes organizing difficult.

### Limited Democracy

While neoliberals nominally support democracy, they advocate
constitutional limits on democratic decision-making to prevent
majorities from interfering with property rights or market outcomes.[^8]
This reflects a fundamental tension between capitalism and democracy
that neoliberals resolve in favor of capitalism.

### Modest Welfare State

Unlike pure libertarianism, neoliberalism accepts some social insurance
and poverty relief, though these should be minimal and preferably
administered through market mechanisms (like vouchers) rather than
direct public provision.[^9]

## Anarchist Critique

### The "Free Market" Requires a Strong State

Despite neoliberal rhetoric about reducing state power, implementing and
maintaining "free markets" requires extensive state violence. The
Chilean and Argentine cases demonstrate this clearly - neoliberalism was
imposed through military dictatorships that murdered and tortured
thousands of workers, activists, and leftists. Even in democracies,
neoliberal policies have required police violence against striking
workers, the criminalization of protest, and the expansion of
surveillance and incarceration.

Neoliberalism does not shrink the state but reconfigures it: reducing
social spending while expanding the repressive apparatus (police,
prisons, military) needed to enforce property relations and suppress
resistance.[^10] Mass incarceration in the United States, for example,
expanded dramatically during the neoliberal era, particularly targeting
poor and racialized communities.

### Enclosure of the Commons

Neoliberalism represents a new wave of
<a href="enclosure" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">enclosure</a>,
privatizing resources and spaces previously held in common - from water
and forests to knowledge (through intellectual property) and even
genetic material. This dispossesses communities of their means of
survival and forces dependence on markets controlled by capital.

### Destruction of Solidarity

By redefining all human relations as competitive market transactions and
all people as isolated consumers rather than members of communities,
neoliberalism attacks the social bonds and collective organizations
necessary for resistance. The destruction of trade unions, mutual aid
networks, and public spaces where people gather has atomized the
<a href="working_class" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a> and made collective action more difficult.

### Environmental Devastation

Neoliberalism's growth imperative and opposition to environmental
regulation have accelerated ecological destruction. The ideology cannot
address climate change because it would require precisely the kind of
coordinated, non-market intervention that neoliberalism rejects.
Meanwhile, neoliberals promote false "market-based solutions" like
carbon trading that allow continued pollution while creating new
opportunities for speculation.

### Inequality and Hierarchy

Rather than creating prosperity for all, neoliberal policies have
dramatically increased economic inequality both within and between
countries.[^11] Wealth has concentrated in fewer hands while working
conditions, wages, and social protections have deteriorated. This
inequality translates into inequality of power - wealthy individuals and
corporations gain increasing control over political institutions while
working people lose influence.

### Colonialism and Imperialism

Neoliberal globalization has reproduced colonial patterns, with wealthy
countries and international institutions imposing policies on poor
countries that benefit foreign corporations and local elites while
impoverishing the majority. Structural adjustment programs have
destroyed local industries and food sovereignty, forcing dependence on
global markets controlled by powerful states and corporations.

### Precarity and Mental Health

The neoliberal era has seen dramatic increases in precarious employment,
debt, overwork, and mental illness. By making individuals solely
responsible for their economic outcomes while removing collective
supports, neoliberalism generates anxiety, depression, and social
isolation. The ideology's competitive ethos encourages people to see
others as threats rather than potential allies.

### False Opposition to State Power

Neoliberals claim to oppose concentrated state power, but they have no
problem with concentrated corporate power. They oppose democratic
control of the economy while supporting private tyranny in the
workplace. This reveals that their real goal is not freedom but a
particular distribution of power favoring capital over labor.

## Resistance

Resistance to neoliberalism has taken many forms, from
anti-globalization movements and occupations to strikes and riots. The
<a href="Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatistas">Zapatistas</a> in Mexico launched their uprising in
1994 explicitly against NAFTA and neoliberal capitalism. The
alter-globalization movement of the late 1990s-early 2000s challenged
institutions like the
<a href="World_Trade_Organization" class="wikilink"
title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> and World
Bank. The 2008 financial crisis sparked movements like
<a href="Occupy_Wall_Street" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">Occupy Wall Street</a>. The
<a href="Yellow_Vests" class="wikilink" title="Yellow Vests">Yellow
Vests</a> protests in France and the 2019 Chilean uprising both targeted
neoliberal policies.

Anarchists have participated in these movements while arguing that
resistance must go beyond reforming neoliberalism to abolishing
capitalism and the state entirely. Building alternative institutions
based on mutual aid, voluntary cooperation, and direct democracy - from
worker cooperatives to community gardens - provides practical examples
of non-capitalist ways of organizing society.
