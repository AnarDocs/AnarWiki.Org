In Octavia Butler's *Parable of the Sower* (1993) and *Parable of the
Talents* (1998), set in California of the 2020s and 2030s, protagonist
Lauren Olamina establishes the Earthseed movement comprising communes,
schools, farms and factories and eventually a space program. Racially
diverse and gender-egalitarian from its beginnings, Earthseed manages to
survive attacks from a Christian supremacist state and the intense
effects of global warming.

Revering the universe's dynamism and malleability, Earthseed adherents
seek to shape the world with kindness and find solace in the fact that
all manifestations of suffering and injustice are temporary. They
believe that humans' "Destiny" is to live in outer space. Earthseed
beliefs are recorded in Lauren Olamina's fictional *Books of the
Living*, many fragments of which appear in Butler's two published
Earthseed novels and an unfinished third installment. Olamina, the
African-American daughter of a Baptist pastor, maintained the language
of "God" but used it in a more pantheistic sense than her father did.
Her first *Book of the Living* introduces the Earthseed philosophy:

> "All that you touch You Change. All that you Change Changes you. The
> only lasting truth Is Change. God Is Change."[^1]

The movement begins among Lauren's friends and neighbors as they trek
northward in *Parable of the Sower*. By the novel's end, the group sets
up the first Earthseed Community, called Acorn, on Taylor Bankole's
estate in Humboldt County, California. Acorn starts with 13 members in
2027 and has 59 members in 2032.[^2] Although Christian supremacists
capture and destroy Acorn the following year, members escape and
continue to spread Earthseed. The movement eventually becomes
influential and owns "land, schools, farms, factories, stores, banks,
several whole towns."[^3] On 20 July 2090, Earthseed sends its first
shuttle into space, with passengers put in suspended animation so that
they'll be alive when they reach their new home planet.[^4]

# Culture

## Ethics

Asked "what do people have to do to be good members of an Earthseed
Community?," Olamina responds: "The essentials are to learn to shape God
with forethought, care, and work; to educate and benefit their
community, their families, and themselves; and to contribute to the
fulfillment of the Destiny" of living in space. The rewards, she
explains, are "A unifying, purposeful life here on Earth, and the hope
of heaven for themselves and their children. A real heaven, not
mythology or philosophy. A heaven that will be theirs to shape."[^5]

</blockquote>

Earthseed emphasizes the virtues of kindness and diversity.[^6]

Olamina recommends a balance of "adaptability and persistent, positive
obsession. Without persistence, what remains is an enthusiasm of the
moment. Without adaptability, what remains may be channeled into
destructive fanaticism. Without positive obsession, there is nothing at
all."[^7]

## God

Olamina explains that "God isn't good or evil, doesn't favor you or hate
you, and yet God is better partnered than fought." Told that this line
of thinking isn't very comforting, she responds, "all the more reason to
care about myself and others. All the more reason to create Earthseed
communities and shape God together."[^8]

## Services and Ritual

Anyone can sign up to preach a sermon at the weekly Gathering.
Afterwards, members discuss it and often engage in polite criticism.[^9]

Earthseed members perceive prayer as a method of "talking yourself into
things, of focusing your attention on whatever it is you want to do."
According to Olamina, "You're the one your words reach and strengthen.
You can think of it as praying to that part of God that's within
you."[^10]

Before aquiring the space program, Earthseed members bury their dead and
embrace the bodies' dissolution into the soil. A funeral oration notes:

> "We give our dead
>
> To the orchards
>
> And the groves.
>
> We give our dead
>
> To life."[^11]

However, Olamina requests that when she dies her ashes be sent into
space.[^12]

## Destiny

"The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars," Olamina
says.[^13] In *Parable of the Talents*, Olamina's daughter Asha Vere
criticizes the Destiny and insists that focus should remain on life here
on Earth.[^14]

# Decisions

Decisions at Acorn are made at a weekly Gathering. Each Earthseed member
gets one vote and an equal share of profits.

Visitors at Acorn may stay for a one-year probationary period and then
are invited to become a voting member. As long as they participate in
the communal work, they receive a share of the profits, although not as
large a share as the voting members do.[^15]

# Economy

Like most common people in the novels' semi-apocalyptic America, Acorn
residents have little access to industrial technology. They had no
computers except for the ones in two trucks that the community acquired.
Residents liken their lifestyle to nineteenth-century living.

Members perform "a lot of hard physical work," although labor was
communal and self-managed.[^16] Work includes farming, building,
teaching, trading at street markets, and scavenging.[^17] Although the
farm has some animals, Acorn residents' diet is predominantly
plant-based. During foraging trips, members gather wild plants and herbs
to use in meals, and they also scavenge from any abandoned gardens and
fields.[^18]

## Education

Each school year, a child does at least one group project and one
individual project. Adult mentors help them choose topics and access
resources. Older children help out the younger children, and "kids begin
to teach themselves and one another."[^19]

Everyone at Acorn learns to read and write, and most know at least two
languages, usually English and Spanish.[^20]
