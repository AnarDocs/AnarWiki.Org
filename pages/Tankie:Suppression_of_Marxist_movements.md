### Notes

- Stalin supported the monarchist and fascist factions in Greece, who
  violently slaughtered Stalinist factions and other Greek paristans,
  out of pettiness against Tito due to disagreements about whether the
  economy should be centrally planned or decentralized
- Vietnam suppresses non-ML Marxists, Trotskyists, anarchists and other
  so-called “ultra-left” communists
- Even Stalinist historians (who are pro-Stalin) think repressions of
  political dissidents went too far
- Stalin handed Marxist dissidents and Communist exiles over to the
  Gestapo of Nazi Germany
- Despite being an ardent defender of Stalin, Michael Parenti
  acknowledges repression of Bolsheviks, political dissidents,
  deportations of ethnic groups and development of a personality cult
  were unnecessary
- Pol Pot's faction murdered the non-racist and anti-Khmer supremacist
  communists in his party in the ‘50s or ‘60s.
- You can't like Mao and Castro at the same time. Across the Global
  South they were at odds with each other. Castro's victories were Mao's
  defeats and vice versa. It was more than an ideological split
