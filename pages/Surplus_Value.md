# Surplus Value

## Overview

**Surplus Value** is a central concept in
<a href="Socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialist">socialist</a>
economic theory, particularly within
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, that
attempts to explain the mechanisms of
<a href="exploitation" class="wikilink"
title="exploitation">exploitation</a> under
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.
The term refers to the difference between the value generated by
<a href="Working_Class" class="wikilink" title="workers">workers</a>
through their labor and the
<a href="Wage_Labour" class="wikilink" title="wages">wages</a> they
receive in return. In Marxian economics, surplus value represents the
source of capitalist
<a href="profit" class="wikilink" title="profit">profit</a>, arising
from the unpaid labor time of workers beyond what is necessary to
reproduce their own labor-power.[^1]

The concept originated within
<a href="Ricardian_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="Ricardian socialism">Ricardian socialism</a>, with
<a href="William_Thompson_(philosopher)" class="wikilink"
title="William Thompson">William Thompson</a> first coining the term
"surplus value" in 1824 to describe "the additional value produced by
the same quantity of labor in consequence of the use of machinery or
other capital."[^2]
<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
subsequently developed and systematized the theory, making it a
cornerstone of his critique of
<a href="political_economy" class="wikilink"
title="political economy">political economy</a>.

While Marx's formulation became the standard interpretation,
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
have offered significant critiques and alternative explanations of
exploitation under capitalism, often locating the source of unearned
income in
<a href="State" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>-enforced
<a href="monopoly" class="wikilink" title="monopolies">monopolies</a>
rather than in the production process itself.

## Origins

The theoretical foundations of surplus value theory emerged during the
early 19th century among <a href="Ricardian_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="Ricardian socialists">Ricardian socialists</a> who built upon
<a href="Adam_Smith" class="wikilink" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>
and <a href="David_Ricardo" class="wikilink" title="David Ricardo">David
Ricardo</a>'s <a href="labor_theory_of_value" class="wikilink"
title="labor theory of value">labor theory of value</a>. Early
developers of related concepts included
<a href="William_Godwin" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">William
Godwin</a> and <a href="Charles_Hall_(economist)" class="wikilink"
title="Charles Hall">Charles Hall</a>, though they used terms such as
"surplus labor" and "surplus produce" rather than surplus value
specifically.[^3]

William Thompson's 1824 work *An Inquiry into the Principles of the
Distribution of Wealth* marked the first explicit use of the term
"surplus value." Thompson distinguished between two measures of value:
the laborer's measure (which would provide replacement of capital plus
compensation for the owner equal to other productive laborers) and the
capitalist's measure (the entire additional value produced through use
of the machinery, all enjoyed by the capitalist).[^4]

Thompson's analysis recognized that while laborers created value through
their work, capitalists claimed the entire surplus based on their
ownership of the <a href="Means_of_Production" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">means of production</a>. This insight would
prove foundational for later socialist economic thought, though Thompson
and other early socialists had not yet developed a complete systematic
theory explaining the precise mechanisms of surplus appropriation.

<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> further developed these ideas, arguing
that "when, by a sort of ellipsis, we say the value of labor, we make an
enjambement, which is not at all contrary to the rules of language, but
which theorists ought to guard against mistaking for a reality."[^5]
Proudhon emphasized that labor itself creates value only when embodied
in products, and that the daily product of labor, not some abstract
"labor-power," should determine compensation.

<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
took up these earlier developments and elaborated them into a
comprehensive theory in his manuscripts of the 1850s-1860s, particularly
in *<a href="A_Contribution_to_the_Critique_of_Political_Economy"
class="wikilink"
title="A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy">A
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</a>* (1859),
*<a href="Theories_of_Surplus_Value" class="wikilink"
title="Theories of Surplus Value">Theories of Surplus Value</a>*
(1862-63), and *<a href="Das_Kapital" class="wikilink"
title="Capital, Volume I">Capital, Volume I</a>* (1867). Marx introduced
the crucial distinction between labor and labor-power, arguing that
capitalists purchase the worker's capacity to labor (labor-power) rather
than labor itself, and that this labor-power produces more value than it
costs to reproduce.

## Marx's Theory

### Labor-Power as a Commodity

Marx's theory rests on treating labor-power itself as a
<a href="Commodity" class="wikilink" title="commodity">commodity</a>
that workers must sell to capitalists. According to Marx, labor-power
possesses the unique property of being "a source of value, whose actual
consumption therefore is itself an embodiment of labor, and
consequently, a creation of value."[^6]

Marx argued that the value of labor-power, like any commodity, is
determined by the labor-time necessary to produce it—specifically, the
value of the means of subsistence necessary to maintain the laborer. If
these necessities require half a day's labor to produce, then the
worker's labor-power costs half a day's labor-value. However, the
capitalist can compel the worker to labor for a full day, thereby
extracting surplus value equal to the difference between what the worker
produces and what the worker costs to maintain.

### Absolute and Relative Surplus Value

Marx distinguished between two forms of surplus value extraction:

**Absolute surplus value** is obtained by extending the working day
beyond the time necessary to produce the equivalent of the worker's
wages. If a worker produces value equal to their daily wage in six hours
but works twelve hours, the additional six hours constitute absolute
surplus value appropriated by the capitalist.[^7]

**Relative surplus value** arises from increasing labor productivity
through mechanization, better organization, or technological
improvements. When productivity increases across society, the value of
the commodities workers consume falls, reducing the value of labor-power
and thereby increasing the proportion of the working day devoted to
surplus labor without extending total working hours.[^8]

### The Production Process

In Marx's analysis, the capitalist purchases three elements: raw
materials (constant capital), machinery and equipment (constant
capital), and labor-power (variable capital). During production, workers
transfer the value of constant capital to the product while
simultaneously creating new value through their labor. This new value
consists of the equivalent of their wages plus surplus value.

Marx illustrated this with the example of yarn production: if cotton
costs 10 shillings, machinery wear totals 2 shillings, and labor costs 3
shillings for six hours' work, the total product value is 15 shillings.
However, if the same worker labors twelve hours for the same 3 shilling
wage, producing 20 pounds of yarn worth 30 shillings total, the
capitalist realizes 3 shillings in surplus value (30 shillings revenue
minus 27 shillings in costs).[^9]

## Anarchist Critiques

### Individualist Anarchist Analysis

<a href="Individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Individualist anarchists">Individualist anarchists</a>,
particularly those following
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> and the
<a href="mutualism" class="wikilink" title="mutualist">mutualist</a>
tradition, have offered fundamental critiques of Marx's surplus value
theory while maintaining their own analysis of capitalist exploitation.

<a href="Henry_Seymour" class="wikilink" title="Henry Seymour">Henry
Seymour</a>, writing in 1897, argued that Marx's theory contains
irreconcilable contradictions. Seymour contended that Marx
simultaneously held that the use-value of commodities does not determine
exchange-value, yet based his entire theory of surplus value on the
special use-value of labor-power producing more value than it costs.
Seymour wrote: "Marx's theory of surplus-value is a complete
contradiction of his theory of value, of which it is pretended to be a
logical corollary."[^10]

Furthermore, individualist anarchists have challenged the classification
of labor-power as a commodity. Marx himself defined a commodity as "an
object upon which labor has been expended," yet labor-power is precisely
that which expends labor rather than an object produced by labor. This
contradiction undermines the foundation of Marx's analysis.[^11]

### The Monopoly Analysis

Rather than locating exploitation primarily in the production process,
<a href="free_market_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="free market anarchists">free market anarchists</a> and mutualists
trace surplus value to
<a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>-enforced
<a href="monopoly" class="wikilink" title="monopolies">monopolies</a>,
particularly the
<a href="money_monopoly" class="wikilink" title="money monopoly">money
monopoly</a>. In this view, when
<a href="gold" class="wikilink" title="gold">gold</a> or any single
commodity is established by law as the exclusive
<a href="medium_of_exchange" class="wikilink"
title="medium of exchange">medium of exchange</a>, its possessors gain
monopolistic control over all economic transactions.

The monetary monopoly creates artificial scarcity of the medium of
exchange, enabling money-holders to extract
<a href="interest" class="wikilink" title="interest">interest</a> and
command labor at below its true value. As Seymour argued: "If gold is
universally adopted as the commodity by means of which all other
commodities are bought and sold, then it is evident that the possessors
of gold possess at the outset the entire purchasing-power of the
world."[^12]

This analysis suggests that in a truly
<a href="free_market" class="wikilink" title="free market">free
market</a> without legal monopolies—particularly without restrictions on
<a href="mutual_credit" class="wikilink" title="mutual credit">mutual
credit</a> and alternative currencies—workers would have access to
capital at cost of issuance, eliminating the basis for sustained
exploitation. The remedy lies not in abolishing private property or
markets, but in abolishing the legal privileges that enable capitalist
extraction.

### The Land Monopoly

Similarly, anarchists have identified the
<a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="monopolization of land">monopolization of land</a> through
state-enforced
<a href="land_ownership" class="wikilink" title="land ownership">land
ownership</a> as another source of unearned income. When access to land
requires payment to landlords rather than being freely available to
those who use it, workers are compelled to accept wages below the full
value of their product.
<a href="Georgism" class="wikilink" title="Georgist">Georgist</a>-influenced
anarchists have particularly emphasized this mechanism of exploitation.

### The Means of Production

While Marx emphasized capitalist ownership of the means of production as
the source of exploitation, many anarchists have argued that such
ownership derives its power not from some inherent feature of
production, but from legal monopolies that prevent workers from
accessing capital and land except through capitalist intermediaries. In
the absence of these monopolies, ownership of machinery or tools would
confer no special advantage, as workers could readily obtain their own
through mutual credit arrangements.

## Social Anarchist Perspectives

<a href="Social_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Social anarchists">Social anarchists</a> generally accept a
version of surplus value theory closer to Marx's formulation, while
rejecting his political conclusions regarding the necessity of a
transitional state. <a href="Anarcho-communists" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communists">Anarcho-communists</a>,
<a href="anarcho-syndicalists" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalists">anarcho-syndicalists</a>, and
<a href="collectivist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist anarchists">collectivist anarchists</a> view the
appropriation of surplus value as intrinsic to wage labor and capitalist
property relations, not merely an artifact of state monopolies.

These anarchists argue that even without legal monopolies, the
concentration of <a href="Means_of_Production" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">means of production</a> in capitalist
hands—achieved through historical processes of
<a href="primitive_accumulation" class="wikilink"
title="primitive accumulation">primitive accumulation</a>—creates
structural coercion compelling workers to sell their labor-power. The
solution lies in <a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>,
<a href="common_ownership" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a> of productive resources,
and the abolition of wage labor itself through
<a href="Anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalist">syndicalist</a> organization or revolutionary
expropriation.

However, social anarchists differ from Marxists in rejecting
<a href="vanguardism" class="wikilink"
title="vanguardism">vanguardism</a> and state socialism as means of
abolishing surplus value extraction. They advocate instead for
<a href="Direct_Action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>,
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and federalist organization of
<a href="workers&#39;_councils" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a> and
<a href="communes" class="wikilink" title="communes">communes</a>
without recreating hierarchical structures.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Measurement and Empirical Studies

Various attempts have been made to measure surplus value empirically
using national economic data. Researchers including Anwar Shaikh and
Ahmet Tonak have reworked official economic statistics to approximate
Marxian categories, finding that the rate of surplus value in advanced
capitalist economies has remained relatively stable over long periods,
though the composition of surplus value recipients has shifted.[^13]

These studies suggest that while the forms of extraction may change—with
increasing portions captured through financial mechanisms,
<a href="intellectual_property" class="wikilink"
title="intellectual property">intellectual property</a> rents, and
<a href="rent-seeking" class="wikilink"
title="rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a> rather than direct industrial
production—the fundamental dynamic of unpaid labor appropriation
persists.

### Financialization

Contemporary anarchist analysis notes that
<a href="financialization" class="wikilink"
title="financialization">financialization</a> and the growth of
<a href="debt" class="wikilink" title="debt">debt</a> relationships have
created new mechanisms for surplus extraction beyond the traditional
industrial wage relationship. Financial capital increasingly captures
value through
<a href="interest" class="wikilink" title="interest">interest</a>,
<a href="speculation" class="wikilink"
title="speculation">speculation</a>, and control over access to credit,
operating as what some theorists call
"<a href="parasitism" class="wikilink" title="parasitism">parasitism</a>"
on productive activity.[^14]

### Precarious Labor

The rise of <a href="precarious_labor" class="wikilink"
title="precarious labor">precarious labor</a>,
<a href="gig_economy" class="wikilink" title="gig work">gig work</a>,
and informal employment has complicated traditional surplus value
analysis. Workers increasingly operate in legal gray zones where the
boundary between independent contractor and employee status becomes
blurred, enabling new forms of appropriation while obscuring traditional
employer-employee relationships.

## Justifications for Extraction

Defenders of capitalism offer various justifications for profit
appropriation, which anarchists and socialists contest:

### Risk Compensation

The claim that profit rewards the risk taken by capitalists in investing
their savings faces several anarchist objections:

1.  Returns on property income bear no relationship to actual risk
    levels. Many extremely safe investments yield returns, while many
    risky ventures fail entirely, suggesting risk is not what is
    actually rewarded.
2.  All human activities involve risk, yet only property owners receive
    systematic compensation for it. Workers risk injury, unemployment,
    and poverty without corresponding guaranteed returns.
3.  Only successful risk-taking is rewarded, and success depends on
    extracting surplus value from labor. Risk itself creates no value;
    profitable outcomes depend on exploitation of productive activity.
4.  Most property income today, particularly from financial assets,
    involves minimal real risk due to state intervention through
    insurance schemes, bailouts, and monetary policy supporting asset
    values.
5.  Risk-bearing cannot be separated from capital ownership itself. The
    supposed reward for risk-taking is simply another justification for
    rewarding those who are already wealthy with more wealth.

### Abstinence or "Waiting"

The argument that profit compensates capitalists for delaying
gratification fails because:

1.  Workers also delay gratification by not consuming all they produce,
    yet receive no additional compensation.
2.  The wealthy who own capital typically enjoy high consumption levels
    while also receiving returns on investments, undermining the
    abstinence claim.
3.  <a href="Interest" class="wikilink" title="Interest">Interest</a>
    and profit accrue regardless of whether the capital owner personally
    abstained or inherited wealth.

### Productivity of Capital

Claims that capital itself is productive and therefore deserves returns
ignore that capital goods are themselves products of previous labor. As
Marx argued, machinery and equipment transfer their value to products
but create no new value—only living labor creates new value. The
productivity of capital-intensive production reflects the productivity
of the workers who built the machines combined with the current workers
operating them.

### Entrepreneurial Contribution

While genuine entrepreneurial and managerial labor does contribute to
production, this does not justify property income. Anarchists
distinguish between:

- Payment for actual managerial labor performed (which should be
  compensated like any productive labor)
- Unearned income from mere ownership of capital, which requires no
  ongoing labor contribution

The latter constitutes exploitation regardless of any initial
entrepreneurial effort, as it represents a permanent claim on others'
labor.

## Alternatives

### Mutualism

<a href="Mutualism" class="wikilink" title="Mutualist">Mutualist</a>
anarchists propose eliminating surplus value extraction through
<a href="mutual_credit" class="wikilink" title="mutual credit">mutual
credit</a> systems that provide capital at cost, eliminating
<a href="interest" class="wikilink" title="interest">interest</a>. In
Proudhon's vision,
<a href="mutual_banks" class="wikilink" title="mutual banks">mutual
banks</a> would issue currency based on property pledged as security,
enabling workers to access tools and materials without capitalist
intermediaries. <a href="Occupancy_and_use" class="wikilink"
title="Occupancy and use">Occupancy and use</a> principles would govern
land access, preventing landlord exploitation.

### Collectivism

<a href="Collectivist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Collectivist anarchists">Collectivist anarchists</a> advocate
collective ownership of means of production with distribution according
to labor contributed. <a href="Workers&#39;_councils" class="wikilink"
title="Workers&#39; councils">Workers' councils</a> would democratically
manage production and distribution, with each worker receiving
compensation corresponding to their labor input, eliminating the surplus
appropriated by capitalist owners.

### Communism

<a href="Anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communist">Anarcho-communist</a> theory moves beyond
concerns about equivalent exchange and surplus value by proposing
<a href="commons" class="wikilink" title="common ownership">common
ownership</a> and distribution according to need. In this framework, the
entire concept of measuring individual contributions and returns becomes
obsolete, replaced by cooperative production for mutual benefit and free
access to collectively produced goods.

### Syndicalism

<a href="Anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="Syndicalist">Syndicalist</a> approaches focus on
<a href="industrial_organization" class="wikilink"
title="industrial organization">industrial organization</a> and
<a href="Direct_Action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> by workers to seize control of production through
<a href="general_strikes" class="wikilink"
title="general strikes">general strikes</a> and
<a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>. By
abolishing the employing class and operating enterprises through
<a href="workers&#39;_councils" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a>, surplus value would
no longer be extracted but would remain with those who produce it.

## Criticism

### Internal Contradictions

Critics have identified several potential contradictions in Marx's
formulation:

- The classification of labor-power as a commodity contradicts Marx's
  own definition of commodities as objects on which labor has been
  expended
- The theory requires that use-value both does and does not determine
  exchange-value[^15]
- The supposed equality between laborer and capitalist in the "free"
  labor market ignores the structural coercion created by unequal access
  to means of production and the monopoly of money

### Alternative Explanations

Various schools offer competing explanations of profit:

- **Neoclassical economics** explains profit as return to marginal
  productivity of capital and entrepreneurship
- **Austrian economics** emphasizes time preference and the productivity
  of longer production processes
- **Institutional economics** focuses on market power, transaction
  costs, and organizational efficiency
- **Post-Keynesian economics** highlights markup pricing and the role of
  aggregate demand

Anarchists critique all these alternatives as ultimately serving to
justify unearned income rather than genuinely explaining the source of
profit.

### Empirical Debates

Disputes continue over whether surplus value theory can be empirically
verified or falsified, whether the labor theory of value on which it
rests accurately describes actual price formation, and whether
alternative theories better explain empirical patterns of income
distribution.
