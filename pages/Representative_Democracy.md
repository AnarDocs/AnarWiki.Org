# Representative Democracy

**Representative democracy** (also **indirect democracy**,
**representative government** or **psephocracy**) is a type of
"<a   href="democracy.md" class="wikilink" title="democracy">"democracy</a>
founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of
people, as opposed to direct democracy. These should not be confused
with directly democratic
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>
"<a   href="Confederation.md" class="wikilink"
title="confederations">"confederations</a>, in which 'representative's
(called delegates for the sake of simplicity) are subject to recall,
short-terms and only represent a small interest.

## History

*See Also:
"<a   href="Timeline_of_Representative_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Timeline of Representative Democracy">"Timeline of Representative
Democracy</a>*

The development of representative democracy has been a long and unstable
process, and that have been constant waves of representative governments
forming as well as backslides into more authoritarian governments.

### Precursors

Although numerous direct democracies have existed throughout history
("<a   href="Athenian_Polis.md" class="wikilink" title="Ancient Athens">"Ancient
Athens</a>, "<a   href="Haudenosaunee_Confederacy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haudenosaunee">"Haudenosaunee</a>, possibly the
"<a   href="Indus_River_Valley_Civilization.md" class="wikilink"
title="Indus River Valley Civilisation">"Indus River Valley
Civilisation</a>) there are few examples of representative democracies.

### First wave

The First wave of democracy, 1828–1926 began in the early 19th century
when suffrage was granted to the majority of white males in the United
States ("Jacksonian democracy"). Then came France, Britain, Canada,
Australia, Italy and Argentina, and a few others before 1900. At its
peak, after the breakup of the Russian, German, Austrian and Ottoman
empires in 1918, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world.
Reversal began in 1922, when Benito Mussolini rose to power in Italy.
The collapse primarily hit newly formed democracies, which could not
stand against the aggressions rise of expansionist communist, fascist
and militaristic authoritarian or totalitarian movements which
systematically rejected democracy. The nadir of the first wave came in
1942, when the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere
12.<sup>\[7\]\[8\]</sup>

### Second wave

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in World War II, and
crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in
the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total
number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the
"flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to
surge in a way no one had ever seen.<sup>\[4\]</sup>

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely
disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some
countries change their positions quite dramatically: Switzerland, which
is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the
right to vote until 1971.<sup>\[9\]</sup>

### Third wave

The Third wave began in 1974 (Carnation Revolution, Portugal) and
included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the
1980s, Asia Pacific countries (Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan)
from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of
democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia,
Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and
Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across
twenty countries.<sup>\[10\]</sup>

Huntington points out that three-fourths of the new democracies were
Roman Catholics.<sup>\[11\]</sup> Most Protestant countries already were
democratic. He emphasizes the Vatican Council of 1962, which turned the
Catholic Church from defenders of the old established order into an
opponent of totalitarianism.<sup>\[12\]</sup>

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy
during a wave are subject to democratic backsliding. Political
scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and
will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and
second waves.<sup>\[13\]</sup> Indeed, in the period immediately
following the onset of the "war on terror" after the September 11, 2001
attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident. How
significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of
debate.<sup>\[*citation needed*\]</sup>

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslid from
democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Poland,
Hungary, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had
democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There
has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma
and Morocco.

## Positives

### Quality of Life

### Peace

Representative democracies are significantly less likely to go to war
than dictatorships[^1] and are far less likely to repress their citizens
(and repression in democracies is significantly smaller) than
dictatorships. Additionally, democracies have significantly lower
violent crime rates. Although there are notably violent democracies
(notably
"<a   href="United_States_of_America.md" class="wikilink" title="USA">"USA</a>,
"<a   href="Israel.md" class="wikilink" title="Israel">"Israel</a>,
"<a   href="South_Africa.md" class="wikilink" title="South Africa">"South
Africa</a> and
"<a   href="Colombia.md" class="wikilink" title="Colombia">"Colombia</a>) and
peaceful dictatorships there is an incredibly strong relationship
between democracy and peace. Of the 40 most peaceful countries on Earth,
only 2 ("<a   href="Qatar.md" class="wikilink" title="Qatar">"Qatar</a> and
"<a   href="Bhutan.md" class="wikilink" title="Bhutan">"Bhutan</a>) aren't
democracies.

## Negatives

### Authoritarian Criticisms

Sociologist
"<a   href="Robert_Michels.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Michels">"Robert
Michels</a> argued that all democratic institutions suffer from an
"<a   href="Iron_Law_of_Oligarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Iron Law of Oligarchy">"Iron Law of Oligarchy</a>, which states
that power tends to be concentrated over time in ANY democratic
organisations, effectively dooming democracy to always be a failure.

### Anarchist Critique

Anarchists have historically maintained a complex and largely critical
relationship with the concept of democracy. While some contemporary
anarchists use "democracy" colloquially to describe autonomous
decision-making and self-determination, classical anarchist theory
consistently rejected democracy in all its forms as fundamentally
incompatible with anarchist principles.

#### Democracy as Government

The fundamental anarchist objection to democracy - whether
representative or direct - is that it remains a form of government, a
system of rule over people. "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> argued that democracy
constitutes "government of the majority of the elected by the majority
of the electors," which "is already beginning to bear a strong
resemblance to minority government."[^2]
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> declared that
"the revolutionary formula cannot be Direct Legislation, nor Direct
Government, nor Simplified Government, that it is No Government,"[^3]
explicitly rejecting democracy alongside monarchy and aristocracy.

The classical anarchist position holds that anarchy - meaning "without
rulers" - cannot be reconciled with democracy - meaning "rule by the
people" - unless one abandons the core anarchist aspiration of
eliminating rulership entirely.[^4]

#### The Tyranny of the Majority

Anarchists reject the principle of majority rule as a form of tyranny.
Proudhon characterized democracy as "nothing but the tyranny of
majorities, the most execrable tyranny of all,"[^5] while
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> opposed "all legislation,
all authority and every privileged, licensed, official, and legal
influence, even that arising from universal suffrage."[^6]

As Malatesta explained, anarchists recognize no right of majorities to
dominate minorities, nor of minorities to dominate majorities. The
anarchist solution is not rule by any group but "the abolition of the
gendarme" and "free agreement, which will be there for all when no one
has the means to force others."[^7]
"<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">"Voltairine de Cleyre</a> argued that
majority rule is "essentially pernicious" and that "the only desirable
condition of society is one in which no one is compelled to accept an
arrangement to which he has not consented."[^8]

#### Democracy and Alienation

Anarchists identify democracy as a system that perpetuates
"<a   href="Alienation.md" class="wikilink" title="alienation">"alienation</a> -
the separation of people from control over their own lives. Democracy
requires that "our desires be separate from our power to act,"
transferring one's will and autonomy to an outside power, whether an
elected representative or an abstract majority.[^9]

This alienation occurs even in direct democratic forms. The separation
between decision-making and action, the reduction of complex desires to
yes/no votes, and the subordination of individual autonomy to collective
procedures all reproduce the basic structure of domination. As one
critique notes, "democracy starts with the assumption that the 'good of
all' takes precedence over the needs and desires of the individual,"
leading to endless compromise where "each leaves the table of
negotiation equally disappointed."[^10]

#### Democracy as Capitalism's Political Form

Anarchists analyze democracy as the political system best suited to
capitalism's needs. Democracy helps capital "permeate every moment of
life" by transforming "living individuals into producer-consumers" and
"the self-creating individual into a citizen of the state."[^11]

The democratic process provides an illusion of participation while real
power remains concentrated in economic elites.
"<a   href="Peter_Gelderloos.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">"Peter Gelderloos</a> argues that "the
fundamental purpose of a democracy, same as any other government, is to
maintain the wealth and power of the ruling class."[^12] Historical
examples like the Civil Rights movement in the United States demonstrate
how democratic reforms often become symbolic gestures that leave
fundamental power structures intact while co-opting and defusing radical
movements.

#### The Problem with Direct Democracy

Unlike some contemporary activists who distinguish between
representative and direct democracy, classical anarchists extended their
critique to all democratic forms.
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> observed that "majority rule is as defective as any other
kind of rule,"[^13] and noted that in intentional communities, "majority
rule and elected government have always been synonymous and concomitant
with disintegration - never with consolidation."[^14]

Direct democracy still embodies majoritarianism, the separation of
decision from action, and institutional distrust - all of which "embody
social atomisation" and stand "in complete opposition to the class
struggle."[^15] Even consensus-based processes can devolve into
elaborate procedures for gaining approval, turning plans for action into
"frustrating exercises in concession, tepid half-measures, and
ultimately; inaction."[^16]

#### Exclusion and the Demos

Democracy necessarily creates boundaries between included and excluded
populations. Whether through citizenship, voting rights, race, gender,
or participation requirements, democracy "institutionalizes the
provincial, chauvinist character of its Greek origins" even as it claims
universal applicability.[^17] This is why democracy has proven "so
compatible with nationalism and the state; it presupposes the Other, who
is not accorded the same rights or political agency."[^18]

As "<a   href="Rousseau.md" class="wikilink" title="Rousseau">"Rousseau</a>
explicitly acknowledged in his Social Contract, there is no
contradiction between democracy and slavery - the freedom of citizens
can coexist with the chains of others. This zero-sum conception of
freedom remains foundational to democratic systems.[^19]

#### Historical Usage and Contemporary Debates

Historically, anarchists rarely used "democracy" to describe their own
visions or practices. When they employed the term, they used it "in its
conventional, statist sense to refer to actually-existing democratic
institutions."[^20] The association between anarchism and democracy only
emerged prominently around the 1980s, primarily through
"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">"Murray Bookchin</a>'s writings, as a rhetorical
strategy to increase anarchism's mainstream appeal.

However, some contemporary anarchists - notably anthropologist
"<a   href="David_Graeber.md" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">"David
Graeber</a> - have used "democracy" in a non-governmental sense to
simply mean situations where people control their own lives and their
choices are respected. This usage treats democracy not as a system of
collective decision-making but as a synonym for autonomy and
self-determination. Critics argue this creates dangerous ambiguity, as
"most people will assume that what you mean by democracy is reconcilable
with the state after all,"[^21] potentially enabling co-optation by
reformist parties that move from grassroots organizing into state
governance.

The rhetorical shift toward democratic language has been criticized for
introducing an "idiosyncratic notion of democracy" incompatible with
common usage, for potentially reinforcing nationalist sentiments by
appealing to patriotic myths about democratic revolutions, and for
obscuring the fundamental distinction between government (the exercise
of authority) and self-determination (disposing of one's potential on
one's own terms).[^22]

#### Anarchist Alternatives

Rather than seeking to perfect or radicalize democracy, most anarchists
advocate for its abolition in favor of
"<a   href="Voluntary_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">"voluntary association</a>,
"<a   href="Free_Agreement.md" class="wikilink" title="free agreement">"free
agreement</a>,
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>,
and
"<a   href="Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="federalist">"federalist</a>
structures that disperse rather than concentrate decision-making
authority. The distinction is between government in any form and
self-determination through freely-made agreements that require no
enforcement.

Where democracy seeks to distribute rulership more broadly or make it
more participatory, anarchism seeks to eliminate rulership entirely,
making it "impossible to impose any form of rule."[^23] This requires
moving beyond both representative and direct democratic models toward
truly horizontal relationships based on autonomy and voluntary
cooperation, where "no one is compelled to accept an arrangement to
which he has not consented."[^24]
