# History of the Commons in Britain

## Overview

The <a href="Commons" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a> in
Britain was the land, resources, and rights held collectively by
communities rather than owned privately. For much of British history,
common land formed the economic foundation of rural life, providing
access to grazing, wood-gathering, fishing, and other essential
resources. The progressive enclosure of common land — from the Norman
Conquest through to the 20th century — represents one of the most
significant acts of theft in British social history, and one that
continues to shape land ownership and access today.

## Anglo-Saxon Period (c.500–1066)

Before the Norman Conquest, Anglo-Saxon England operated under flexible
systems of communal land use. While the concept of ownership existed, it
functioned differently from later feudal arrangements. Land use was
organised around strip farming (communities dividing arable land into
strips worked by individual families), common grazing on shared pasture,
communal woodland access for fuel and building materials, and seasonal
boundaries that adapted to agricultural cycles.

Anglo-Saxon kings hunted, but did not designate areas as being outside
the law of the land. Commoners held recognised rights to use forests and
common land, varying by location, time, and social standing.

The <a href="open_field_system" class="wikilink"
title="open field system">open field system</a>, which persisted in many
areas until parliamentary enclosure, was already established during this
period. Three large fields were divided into strips, with families
working multiple non-contiguous plots — ensuring access to both good and
poor soil. After harvest, fields became temporary commons for communal
grazing.

## Norman Conquest and the Royal Forests (1066–1215)

The Norman Conquest of 1066 began the systematic dispossession of common
rights. William the Conqueror divided England among his Norman barons,
transforming land communities had worked for generations into the
property of foreign lords. While peasants lost sovereignty over the
land, they initially retained many usage rights.

William and his successors introduced the French concept of "royal
forests" to England. Under this system, "forest" designated any enclosed
area where royalty (or occasionally aristocrats) held exclusive rights
to game and the vegetation on which it fed. Special Forest Law operated
separately from common law, covering not just woodland but heathland,
grassland, wetlands, and entire villages. Penalties for hunting,
gathering wood, or building in royal forests were severe: heavy fines,
mutilation, or death.

William the Conqueror and William Rufus (reigned 1087–1100) were
passionate hunters who reserved vast forests for private use — providing
expansive hunting grounds and lucrative monopolies on firewood sales.
Successive Plantagenet kings continued the expansion. By the early 13th
century, approximately one-third of southern England had been designated
royal forest, severely restricting commoners' ability to farm, forage,
and access resources for charcoal burning, pig pasture (pannage),
firewood collection (estover), grazing (agistment), and turf-cutting
(turbary).[^1]

This expansion became a central grievance leading to
<a href="Magna_Carta" class="wikilink" title="Magna Carta">Magna
Carta</a> in 1215, though that document contained only four brief
clauses addressing forest issues.

## The Charter of the Forest (1217)

When King John died in October 1216, England was in civil war. The
nine-year-old Henry III required a regency council led by William
Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. After Marshal defeated the French-backed
rebels at the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217, the
<a href="Charter_of_the_Forest" class="wikilink"
title="Charter of the Forest">Charter of the Forest</a> was issued on 6
November 1217 as part of the peace settlement.

Magna Carta had addressed baronial grievances, largely ignoring the
survival concerns of ordinary people regarding forest access. The
regency council needed to pacify the entire population. Pressure came
from commoners and peasants who had lost essential resources, from
lesser gentry whose lands had been "afforested" without consent, and
from the Church (which held the Franciscan principle: *juri divino omni
sunt communia* — "by divine law all things are common").

The 1217 Charter was remarkable in scope. It ordered royal forests
reduced to their extent under Henry II, rolling back decades of
expansion. It established legal mechanisms for redress against royal
abuses. It removed the death penalty for poaching, replacing it with
fines or one year's imprisonment. It restored rights of hunting,
grazing, and fuel collection to "free men" — though not to serfs, who
made up roughly 80% of the population. Its final clause stated simply:
"These liberties concerning the forests we have granted to
everybody."[^2]

Henry III cancelled the charter when he came of age in 1227. For the
next 70 years, both Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest were
subjects of ongoing power struggles until Edward I confirmed both in
law. The pattern became cyclical: monarchs conceded the charter's terms
in exchange for tax revenue, then eroded them again when possible.

The charter remained on the statute books until 1971 — 754 years, making
it the longest-standing statute in English history. Its final repeal
came not to restore commons but to modernise wildlife law and facilitate
the commodification of natural resources.

It is also worth noting that the Charter of the Forest gave Magna Carta
its name: the 1215 document was originally known simply as the "Charter
of Liberties." Only after the forest charter was issued did "Magna
Carta" (Great Charter) come into use, distinguishing the larger document
from its smaller companion. While Magna Carta is remembered as the
foundation of English liberties, the Charter of the Forest was more
immediately important to ordinary people.

## Late Medieval Commons (13th–15th Centuries)

Following the Charter of the Forest, a complex system of common rights
persisted across medieval England. Common land included arable strips
(which became common grazing after harvest), permanent pasture for
grazing with regulated stinting on animal numbers, woodland rights for
dead wood collection and pig forage, waste land for turf-cutting and
quarrying, and water rights for fishing (piscary).

These rights were not absolute freedoms but carefully regulated through
custom and manorial courts, balancing individual use with collective
sustainability. Modern research by
<a href="Elinor_Ostrom" class="wikilink" title="Elinor Ostrom">Elinor
Ostrom</a> — awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 — demonstrated
that such commons were sophisticated governance systems that managed
resources sustainably for centuries, directly contradicting the
"<a href="tragedy_of_the_commons" class="wikilink"
title="tragedy of the commons">tragedy of the commons</a>" theory that
Garrett Hardin invented in 1968 to justify enclosure.[^3]

From the 13th century, population growth created pressure on common
resources. Some lords began enclosing portions of common land for
intensive agriculture or sheep grazing as the wool trade expanded. These
early enclosures were often contested and sometimes reversed.

The <a href="Black_Death" class="wikilink" title="Black Death">Black
Death</a> (1348–1350) killed approximately one-third of England's
population, shifting the balance of power between lords and commoners.
Labour scarcity strengthened peasants' bargaining position, leading to
higher wages, increased worker mobility, and greater security of tenure.
Attempts by the nobility to restore pre-plague conditions — including
the Statute of Labourers (1351) capping wages — created tensions that
would explode in 1381.

## Early Enclosure and Resistance (15th–17th Centuries)

From the 15th century, enclosure accelerated, driven by the
profitability of wool production, rising land values, growing market
pressures, and legal changes making it easier to extinguish common
rights. Enclosure took multiple forms: physical fencing of previously
open land, legal extinction of common rights through manorial courts,
gradual piece-by-piece appropriation, and large-scale reorganisation of
entire parishes.

Commons issues were central to major popular uprisings across this
period.

### The Peasants' Revolt (1381)

Though triggered by the Poll Tax, the largest popular uprising in
English history included demands for free use of common land. Wat Tyler
led tens of thousands from Kent and Essex to London demanding an end to
serfdom, abolition of feudal services, and free access to common land.
Richard II promised reforms at Smithfield before having Tyler killed.
The promises were immediately revoked, but the revolt expressed the
commons as a birthright of the poor.

### Kett's Rebellion (1549)

16,000 people rose in Norfolk against enclosure and rack-renting
landlords. Robert Kett briefly governed Norwich before being executed.
The rebellion represented one of the clearest articulations of common
rights as a political demand — not charity but birthright.[^4]

### The Levellers (1640s)

During the English Civil War, the
<a href="Levellers" class="wikilink" title="Levellers">Levellers</a>
fought primarily for political rights: universal male suffrage,
abolition of the House of Lords, and a written constitution (the
*Agreement of the People*, 1647). Their focus was political equality
rather than land redistribution, though they opposed the concentration
of landed wealth.

### The Diggers (1649–1650)

The most radical commons thinkers England produced, the
<a href="Diggers" class="wikilink" title="Diggers">Diggers</a> were led
by <a href="Gerrard_Winstanley" class="wikilink"
title="Gerrard Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a>. In April 1649 they
began cultivating waste land on St George's Hill, Surrey. Their core
principles were direct and uncompromising: the earth is "a common
treasury for all," the Norman Conquest was theft and enclosure its
continuation, all should have equal access to land, and no one should
work for wages on land they could work collectively.

Local landowners dispersed the Diggers within a year, but Winstanley's
*The Law of Freedom* (1652) laid out a fully developed vision of
agrarian communism. The Diggers remain the clearest articulation of the
commons as a revolutionary political programme in English history.[^5]

Thomas More's
*<a href="Utopia" class="wikilink" title="Utopia">Utopia</a>* (1516) had
already made the connection between enclosure and dispossession
explicit: "sheep devour men," describing how profitable wool production
led to evictions and rural depopulation.[^6]

## Parliamentary Enclosure (1760–1870)

Parliamentary enclosure required individual Acts of Parliament to
enclose specific parishes. It began in the late 17th century but
accelerated dramatically from 1760 — enclosure industrialised, made
systematic, legal, and comprehensive.

Between 1760 and 1870, approximately 4,000 Acts of Parliament were
passed, enclosing roughly 6 million acres — an area larger than Wales —
and transferring about one-sixth of England and Wales from common use to
private ownership.[^7] The machine operated most intensively during the
Napoleonic Wars: 122 Acts were passed in 1801 alone, with 133 in 1811.

Each enclosure required a separate private Act. Petitions were submitted
(usually by major landowners), commissioners appointed to survey and
allocate land, costs assessed and charged to all parties (in practice,
to those losing commons), physical enclosure carried out with hedges and
fences, and new owners received individual freehold title. Commissioners
typically favoured substantial landowners. Small commoners received
inadequate compensation or could not afford the costs, forcing them to
sell their allocations.

Proponents argued enclosure would increase agricultural productivity
through "improvement" and allow scientific farming methods. These
arguments reflected Enlightenment faith in private property and market
efficiency — the same arguments used today to justify privatisation of
public services.

### Social Consequences

The rural poor lost access to grazing rights for their animals, fuel
from common woodland, food from foraging and small-scale farming, and
the supplementary income sources that had maintained semi-independence.
Without these resources, families were forced into wage labour or
migration to industrial towns. E.P. Thompson's *The Making of the
English Working Class* (1963) argues this dispossession created the
industrial proletariat — the enclosure of land preceded and enabled the
enclosure of labour.[^8]

Commons had sustained not just economic life but social relationships:
communal festivals and traditions, collective decision-making processes,
interdependent support networks, and knowledge systems about sustainable
resource management. Enclosure destroyed these overnight, replacing
communal governance with private property rights. As Thompson later
wrote, what was lost was not just material subsistence but a whole
culture of mutuality.[^9]

### The Gleaning Case (1788)

*Steel v Houghton* (1788) held that gleaning — gathering leftover grain
from harvested fields — was not a legal right but a privilege at the
landowner's discretion. This criminalised a subsistence practice as old
as the Book of Ruth that had fed the rural poor for millennia. The
judgment provided brutal judicial confirmation of the enclosure
worldview: access to the land's produce was the landowner's gift, not
the poor person's right.

### Resistance

The <a href="Luddites" class="wikilink" title="Luddites">Luddites</a>
(1811–1816), though primarily focused on machinery, emerged from
communities devastated by enclosure. Framework knitters and textile
workers, many displaced from enclosed land, defended customary rights to
control their labour. They understood that enclosure of the commons was
followed by enclosure of their skills and autonomy.

The <a href="Captain_Swing_Riots" class="wikilink"
title="Captain Swing Riots">Captain Swing Riots</a> (1830) — the last
great rural uprising — saw agricultural labourers across southern
England smashing threshing machines, burning ricks, and threatening
landlords with anonymous letters signed "Captain Swing." The uprising
responded to the final degradation of rural life following enclosure.
Over 2,000 participants were tried; 19 were executed and nearly 500
transported to Australia. This effectively broke the English rural poor
as a fighting force.[^10]

In Wales, a rare success: farmers and commoners in Ceredigion resisted
the enclosure of Mynydd Bach by English settler Augustus Brackenbury in
1815. Led by a local woman known as "Yr Hen Waneg" (The Old Wave), they
repeatedly tore down his fences until he abandoned the project.

### John Clare

The "peasant poet" of Northamptonshire,
<a href="John_Clare" class="wikilink" title="John Clare">John Clare</a>
(1793–1864), witnessed his landscape's destruction and recorded it in
verse. In "The Lament of Swordy Well" — written in the voice of a
limestone heath enclosed under the Acts — he wrote:

> They turned me inside out\
> For sand and grit and stones\
> And turned my old green hills about\
> And pickt my very bones

In "Remembrances": "Enclosure like a Buonaparte let not a thing remain /
It levelled every bush and tree and levelled every hill."

Clare ended his life in an asylum, his mind broken in part by watching
his landscape destroyed. William Cobbett's *Rural Rides* (1830)
documented the poverty created by enclosure; Oliver Goldsmith's *The
Deserted Village* (1770) had already lamented rural depopulation a
generation earlier.

## Victorian Era to Present (1870–Present)

As enclosure spread into urban areas, the
<a href="Commons_Preservation_Society" class="wikilink"
title="Commons Preservation Society">Commons Preservation Society</a>
(1865) — later the Open Spaces Society — fought legal battles to
preserve remaining commons around London and other cities.

The Epping Forest Act (1878), won after decades of illegal enclosure by
lords of the manor, protected 6,000 acres "for the recreation and
enjoyment of the people." This was a genuine victory — but also measured
how little remained. The forest was saved because reformers could point
to it as a rare surviving example of what had once been everywhere.

A government census of 1873–1874 found only approximately 2.5 million
acres of common land remaining in England and Wales — down from perhaps
25% of the land area two centuries earlier.

Much remaining common land passed into state trusteeship after 1945: the
National Trust, the Forestry Commission, and various local authorities.
This offered protection from outright sale but transferred control from
communities of commoners to bureaucratic management. The commons became
a managed heritage site rather than a lived resource.

### Thatcherism as Enclosure

Margaret Thatcher's government (1979–1990) carried out the largest
privatisation programme in British history — the direct ideological
continuation of parliamentary enclosure. Council housing built with
public money was sold under Right to Buy, ending up in many cases as
buy-to-let investments. An attempt in 1981 to sell the entire Forestry
Commission estate (240,000 hectares) was reversed only after mass public
outcry. Water, gas, electricity, and railways were sold off. Private
ownership was again presented as "efficiency," communal and public use
as "waste."

### Contemporary Enclosures

The enclosure impulse never died. In 2011, the Coalition government
announced plans to sell 15% of England's public forests. Half a million
people signed a petition within weeks and the government backed down —
demonstrating both that enclosure remains an active project and that
popular resistance remains possible.

In 2025, the City of London Corporation — Conservator of
<a href="Epping_Forest" class="wikilink" title="Epping Forest">Epping
Forest</a> since 1878 — moved to rename the 1,800-acre "buffer lands"
surrounding the protected forest as "Complementary Lands" and
commissioned an appraisal assessing their potential for housing
development and sale. The protected 6,000 acres cannot be sold under the
1878 Act; the buffer lands carry no such protection. The renaming
represents the same ideological move as historical enclosure: devalue
linguistically, then enclose physically.

Allotments are sold for development. Community centres and libraries are
closed or privatised. The NHS is progressively outsourced. The internet,
once a common space, is increasingly enclosed by paywalls, walled
gardens, and surveillance capitalism. The language changes; the process
does not.

## Types of Common Rights

Common rights in Britain were complex and varied by region. Agricultural
rights included common of pasture (grazing animals on common land, often
with limits — "stinting" — on numbers), common of pannage (pigs foraging
for acorns in woodland), common of estover (collecting wood for fuel,
repairs, and tools), and common of turbary (cutting turf or peat for
fuel).

Resource rights included common of piscary (fishing in common waters),
rights to gather wild food and medicinal plants, and quarrying rights
for local use. Gleaning rights — gathering leftover crops after harvest
— were crucial for the rural poor until legally extinguished in 1788.

Commons were not "open access" resources but carefully regulated through
manorial courts, which set stinting limits and usage rules; common-right
holders with standing to participate in governance; customary law
varying by locality; and seasonal regulations. The sophisticated
governance these systems embodied contradicts the "tragedy of the
commons" myth that has been used to justify enclosure for over 50 years.

## Land Ownership Today

The legacy of enclosure is visible in current land ownership.
Approximately half of England is owned by just 25,000 landowners — less
than 1% of the population.[^11] The aristocracy retains vast estates
acquired through historical enclosure. Most people spend their working
lives paying mortgages on small plots — a condition made possible by the
destruction of the commons that once enabled rural subsistence without
landlord dependency.

Traditional commons governance emphasised sustainability and long-term
stewardship; private ownership incentivises short-term extraction.
Biodiversity declined as intensive agriculture replaced varied commons
usage. Traditional ecological knowledge was lost. These are not separate
processes: the enclosure of land and the degradation of the environment
are the same process.
