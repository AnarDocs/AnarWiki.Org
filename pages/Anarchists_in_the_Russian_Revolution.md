# Anarchists in the Russian Revolution

The Russian revolution of 1917 saw a huge growth in anarchism in that
country and many experiments in anarchist ideas. However, in popular
culture the Russian Revolution is seen not as a mass movement by
ordinary people struggling towards freedom but as the means by which
Lenin imposed his dictatorship on Russia. The truth is radically
different. The Russian Revolution was a mass movement from below in
which many different currents of ideas existed and in which millions of
working people (workers in the cities and towns as well as peasants)
tried to transform their world into a better place. Sadly, those hopes
and dreams were crushed under the dictatorship of the Bolshevik party --
first under Lenin, later under Stalin.

The Russian Revolution, like most history, is a good example of the
maxim "history is written by those who win." Most capitalist histories
of the period between 1917 and 1921 ignore what the anarchist Voline
called ***"the unknown revolution"*** -- the revolution called forth
from below by the actions of ordinary people. Leninist accounts, at
best, praise this autonomous activity of workers so long as it coincides
with their own party line but radically condemn it (and attribute it
with the basest motives) as soon as it strays from that line. Thus
Leninist accounts will praise the workers when they move ahead of the
Bolsheviks (as in the spring and summer of 1917) but will condemn them
when they oppose Bolshevik policy once the Bolsheviks are in power. At
worse, Leninist accounts portray the movement and struggles of the
masses as little more than a backdrop to the activities of the vanguard
party.

For anarchists, however, the Russian Revolution is seen as a classic
example of a social revolution in which the self-activity of working
people played a key role. In their soviets, factory committees and other
class organisations, the Russian masses were trying to transform society
from a class-ridden, hierarchical statist regime into one based on
liberty, equality and solidarity. As such, the initial months of the
Revolution seemed to confirm Bakunin's prediction that the "*future
social organisation must be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the
free associations or federations of workers, firstly in their unions,
then in the communes, regions, nations and finally in a great
federation, international and universal.*" \[**Michael Bakunin: Selected
Writings**, p. 206\] The soviets and factory committees expressed
concretely Bakunin's ideas and Anarchists played an important role in
the struggle.

The initial overthrow of the Tsar came from the direct action of the
masses. In February 1917, the women of Petrograd erupted in bread riots.
On February 18th, the workers of the Putilov Works in Petrograd went on
strike. By February 22nd, the strike had spread to other factories. Two
days later, 200 000 workers were on strike and by February 25th the
strike was virtually general. The same day also saw the first bloody
clashes between protestors and the army. The turning point came on the
27th, when some troops went over to the revolutionary masses, sweeping
along other units. This left the government without its means of
coercion, the Tsar abdicated and a provisional government was formed.

So spontaneous was this movement that all the political parties were
left behind. This included the Bolsheviks, with the "*Petrograd
organisation of the Bolsheviks oppos\[ing\] the calling of strikes
precisely on the eve of the revolution destined to overthrow the Tsar.
Fortunately, the workers ignored the Bolshevik 'directives' and went on
strike anyway . . . Had the workers followed its guidance, it is
doubtful that the revolution would have occurred when it did.*" \[Murray
Bookchin, **Post-Scarcity Anarchism**, p. 123\]

The revolution carried on in this vein of direct action from below until
the new, "socialist" state was powerful enough to stop it.

For the Left, the end of Tsarism was the culmination of years of effort
by socialists and anarchists everywhere. It represented the progressive
wing of human thought overcoming traditional oppression, and as such was
duly praised by leftists around the world. However, **in** Russia things
were progressing. In the workplaces and streets and on the land, more
and more people became convinced that abolishing feudalism politically
was **not** enough. The overthrow of the Tsar made little real
difference if feudal exploitation still existed in the economy, so
workers started to seize their workplaces and peasants, the land. All
across Russia, ordinary people started to build their own organisations,
unions, co-operatives, factory committees and councils (or "soviets" in
Russian). These organisations were initially organised in anarchist
fashion, with recallable delegates and being federated with each other.

Needless to say, all the political parties and organisations played a
role in this process. The two wings of the Marxist social-democrats were
active (the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks), as were the Social
Revolutionaries (a populist peasant based party) and the anarchists. The
anarchists participated in this movement, encouraging all tendencies to
self-management and urging the overthrow of the provisional government.
They argued that it was necessary to transform the revolution from a
purely political one into an economic/social one. Until the return of
Lenin from exile, they were the only political tendency who thought
along those lines.

Lenin convinced his party to adopt the slogan "All Power to the Soviets"
and push the revolution forward. This meant a sharp break with previous
Marxist positions, leading one ex-Bolshevik turned Menshevik to comment
that Lenin had "*made himself a candidate for one European throne that
has been vacant for thirty years -- the throne of Bakunin!*" \[quoted by
Alexander Rabinowitch, **Prelude to Revolution**, p. 40\] The Bolsheviks
now turned to winning mass support, championing direct action and
supporting the radical actions of the masses, policies in the past
associated with anarchism (*"the Bolsheviks launched . . . slogans which
until then had been particularly and insistently been voiced by the
Anarchists."* \[Voline, **The Unknown Revolution**, p. 210\]). Soon they
were winning more and more votes in the soviet and factory committee
elections. As Alexander Berkman argues, the *"Anarchist mottoes
proclaimed by the Bolsheviks did not fail to bring results. The masses
relied to their flag."* \[**What is Anarchism**?, p. 120\]

The anarchists were also influential at this time. Anarchists were
particularly active in the movement for workers self-management of
production which existed around the factory committees (see M. Brinton,
**The Bolsheviks and Workers Control** for details). They were arguing
for workers and peasants to expropriate the owning class, abolish all
forms of government and re-organise society from the bottom up using
their own class organisations -- the soviets, the factory committees,
co-operatives and so on. They could also influence the direction of
struggle. As Alexander Rabinowitch (in his study of the July uprising of
1917) notes:

> *"At the rank-and-file level, particularly within the \[Petrograd\]
> garrison and at the Kronstadt naval base, there was in fact very
> little to distinguish Bolshevik from Anarchist. . . The
> Anarchist-Communists and the Bolsheviks competed for the support of
> the same uneducated, depressed, and dissatisfied elements of the
> population, and the fact is that in the summer of 1917, the
> Anarchist-Communists, with the support they enjoyed in a few important
> factories and regiments, possessed an undeniable capacity to influence
> the course of events. Indeed, the Anarchist appeal was great enough in
> some factories and military units to influence the actions of the
> Bolsheviks themselves."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 64\]

Indeed, one leading Bolshevik stated in June, 1917 (in response to a
rise in anarchist influence), *"\[b\]y fencing ourselves off from the
Anarchists, we may fence ourselves off from the masses."* \[quoted by
Alexander Rabinowitch, **Op. Cit.**, p. 102\]

The anarchists operated with the Bolsheviks during the October
Revolution which overthrew the provisional government. But things
changed once the authoritarian socialists of the Bolshevik party had
seized power. While both anarchists and Bolsheviks used many of the same
slogans, there were important differences between the two. As Voline
argued, *"\[f\]rom the lips and pens of the Anarchists, those slogans
were sincere and concrete, for they corresponded to their principles and
called for action entirely in conformity with such principles. But with
the Bolsheviks, the same slogans meant practical solutions totally
different from those of the libertarians and did not tally with the
ideas which the slogans appeared to express."* \[**The Unknown
Revolution**, p. 210\]

Take, for example, the slogan *"All power to the Soviets."* For
anarchists it meant exactly that -- organs for the working class to run
society directly, based on mandated, recallable delegates. For the
Bolsheviks, that slogan was simply the means for a Bolshevik government
to be formed over and above the soviets. The difference is important,
*"for the Anarchists declared, if 'power' really should belong to the
soviets, it could not belong to the Bolshevik party, and if it should
belong to that Party, as the Bolsheviks envisaged, it could not belong
to the soviets."* \[Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 213\] Reducing the soviets
to simply executing the decrees of the central (Bolshevik) government
and having their All-Russian Congress be able to recall the government
(i.e. those with **real** power) does not equal "all power," quite the
reverse.

Similarly with the term *"workers' control of production."* Before the
October Revolution Lenin saw *"workers' control"* purely in terms of the
*"universal, all-embracing workers' control over the capitalists."*
\[**Will the Bolsheviks Maintain Power?**, p. 52\] He did not see it in
terms of workers' management of production itself (i.e. the abolition of
wage labour) via federations of factory committees. Anarchists and the
workers' factory committees did. As S.A. Smith correctly notes, Lenin
used *"the term \['workers' control'\] in a very different sense from
that of the factory committees."* In fact Lenin's *"proposals . . .
\[were\] thoroughly statist and centralist in character, whereas the
practice of the factory committees was essentially local and
autonomous."* \[**Red Petrograd**, p. 154\] For anarchists, *"if the
workers' organisations were capable of exercising effective control
\[over their bosses\], then they also were capable of guaranteeing all
production. In such an event, private industry could be eliminated
quickly but progressively, and replaced by collective industry.
Consequently, the Anarchists rejected the vague nebulous slogan of
'control of production.' They advocated **expropriation -- progressive,
but immediate -- of private industry by the organisations of collective
production.**"* \[Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 221\]

Once in power, the Bolsheviks systematically undermined the popular
meaning of workers' control and replaced it with their own, statist
conception. *"On three occasions,"* one historian notes, *"in the first
months of Soviet power, the \[factory\] committee leaders sought to
bring their model into being. At each point the party leadership
overruled them. The result was to vest both managerial and control
powers in organs of the state which were subordinate to the central
authorities, and formed by them."* \[Thomas F. Remington, **Building
Socialism in Bolshevik Russia**, p. 38\] This process ultimately
resulted in Lenin arguing for, and introducing, *"one-man management"*
armed with *"dictatorial"* power (with the manager appointed from above
by the state) in April 1918. This process is documented in Maurice
Brinton's **The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control**, which also indicates
the clear links between Bolshevik practice and Bolshevik ideology as
well as how both differed from popular activity and ideas.

Hence the comments by Russian Anarchist Peter Arshinov:

> *"Another no less important peculiarity is that \[the\] October
> \[revolution of 1917\] has two meanings -- that which the working'
> masses who participated in the social revolution gave it, and with
> them the Anarchist-Communists, and that which was given it by the
> political party \[the Marxist-Communists\] that captured power from
> this aspiration to social revolution, and which betrayed and stifled
> all further development. An enormous gulf exists between these two
> interpretations of October. The October of the workers and peasants is
> the suppression of the power of the parasite classes in the name of
> equality and self-management. The Bolshevik October is the conquest of
> power by the party of the revolutionary intelligentsia, the
> installation of its 'State Socialism' and of its 'socialist' methods
> of governing the masses."* \[**The Two Octobers**\]

Initially, anarchists had supported the Bolsheviks, since the Bolshevik
leaders had hidden their state-building ideology behind support for the
soviets (as socialist historian Samuel Farber notes, the anarchists
*"had actually been an unnamed coalition partner of the Bolsheviks in
the October Revolution."* \[**Before Stalinism**, p. 126\]). However,
this support quickly "withered away" as the Bolsheviks showed that they
were, in fact, not seeking true socialism but were instead securing
power for themselves and pushing not for collective ownership of land
and productive resources but for government ownership. The Bolsheviks,
as noted, systematically undermined the workers' control/self-management
movement in favour of capitalist-like forms of workplace management
based around *"one-man management"* armed with *"dictatorial powers."*

As regards the soviets, the Bolsheviks systematically undermining what
limited independence and democracy they had. In response to the *"great
Bolshevik losses in the soviet elections"* during the spring and summer
of 1918 *"Bolshevik armed force usually overthrew the results of these
provincial elections." Also, the "government continually postponed the
new general elections to the Petrograd Soviet, the term of which had
ended in March 1918. Apparently, the government feared that the
opposition parties would show gains."* \[Samuel Farber, **Op. Cit.**, p.
24 and p. 22\] In the Petrograd elections, the Bolsheviks "lost the
absolute majority in the soviet they had previously enjoyed" but
remained the largest party. However, the results of the Petrograd soviet
elections were irrelevant as a *"Bolshevik victory was assured by the
numerically quite significant representation now given to trade unions,
district soviets, factory-shop committees, district workers conferences,
and Red Army and naval units, in which the Bolsheviks had overwhelming
strength."* \[Alexander Rabinowitch, "The Evolution of Local Soviets in
Petrograd", pp. 20-37, **Slavic Review**, Vol. 36, No. 1, p. 36f\] In
other words, the Bolsheviks had undermined the democratic nature of the
soviet by swamping it by their own delegates. Faced with rejection in
the soviets, the Bolsheviks showed that for them "soviet power" equalled
party power. To stay in power, the Bolsheviks had to destroy the
soviets, which they did. The soviet system remained "soviet" in name
only. Indeed, from 1919 onwards Lenin, Trotsky and other leading
Bolsheviks were admitting that they had created a party dictatorship
and, moreover, that such a dictatorship was essential for any revolution
(Trotsky supported party dictatorship even after the rise of Stalinism).

The Red Army, moreover, no longer was a democratic organisation. In
March of 1918 Trotsky had abolished the election of officers and soldier
committees:

> *"the principle of election is politically purposeless and technically
> inexpedient, and it has been, in practice, abolished by decree."*
> \[**Work, Discipline, Order**\]

As Maurice Brinton correctly summarises:

> *"Trotsky, appointed Commissar of Military Affairs after
> Brest-Litovsk, had rapidly been reorganising the Red Army. The death
> penalty for disobedience under fire had been restored. So, more
> gradually, had saluting, special forms of address, separate living
> quarters and other privileges for officers. Democratic forms of
> organisation, including the election of officers, had been quickly
> dispensed with."* \[*"The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control"*, **For
> Workers' Power**, pp. 336-7\]

Unsurprisingly, Samuel Farber notes that *"there is no evidence
indicating that Lenin or any of the mainstream Bolshevik leaders
lamented the loss of workers' control or of democracy in the soviets, or
at least referred to these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared with
the replacement of War Communism by NEP in 1921."* \[**Before
Stalinism**, p. 44\]

Thus after the October Revolution, anarchists started to denounce the
Bolshevik regime and call for a ***"Third Revolution"*** which would
finally free the masses from all bosses (capitalist or socialist). They
exposed the fundamental difference between the rhetoric of Bolshevism
(as expressed, for example, in Lenin's State and Revolution) with its
reality. Bolshevism in power had proved Bakunin's prediction that the
*"dictatorship of the proletariat"* would become the *"dictatorship
**over** the proletariat"* by the leaders of the Communist Party.

The influence of the anarchists started to grow. As Jacques Sadoul (a
French officer) noted in early 1918:

> *"The anarchist party is the most active, the most militant of the
> opposition groups and probably the most popular . . . The Bolsheviks
> are anxious."* \[quoted by Daniel Guerin, **Anarchism**, pp. 95-6\]

By April 1918, the Bolsheviks began the physical suppression of their
anarchist rivals. On April 12th, 1918, the Cheka (the secret police
formed by Lenin in December, 1917) attacked anarchist centres in Moscow.
Those in other cities were attacked soon after. As well as repressing
their most vocal opponents on the left, the Bolsheviks were restricting
the freedom of the masses they claimed to be protecting. Democratic
soviets, free speech, opposition political parties and groups,
self-management in the workplace and on the land -- all were destroyed
in the name of "socialism." All this happened, we must stress,
**before** the start of the Civil War in late May, 1918, which most
supporters of Leninism blame for the Bolsheviks' authoritarianism.
During the civil war, this process accelerated, with the Bolsheviks'
systematically repressing opposition from all quarters -- including the
strikes and protests of the very class who they claimed was exercising
its "dictatorship" while they were in power!

It is important to stress that this process had started well **before**
the start of the civil war, confirming anarchist theory that a "workers'
state" is a contraction in terms. For anarchists, the Bolshevik
substitution of party power for workers power (and the conflict between
the two) did not come as a surprise. The state is the delegation of
**power** -- as such, it means that the idea of a "workers' state"
expressing "workers' power" is a logical impossibility. If workers
**are** running society then power rests in their hands. If a state
exists then power rests in the hands of the handful of people at the
top, **not** in the hands of all. The state was designed for minority
rule. No state can be an organ of working class (i.e. majority)
self-management due to its basic nature, structure and design. For this
reason anarchists have argued for a bottom-up federation of workers'
councils as the agent of revolution and the means of managing society
after capitalism and the state have been abolished.

As we discuss in section H, the degeneration of the Bolsheviks from a
popular working class party into dictators over the working class did
not occur by accident. A combination of political ideas and the
realities of state power (and the social relationships it generates)
could not help but result in such a degeneration. The political ideas of
Bolshevism, with its vanguardism, fear of spontaneity and identification
of party power with working class power inevitably meant that the party
would clash with those whom it claimed to represent. After all, if the
party is the vanguard then, automatically, everyone else is a "backward"
element. This meant that if the working class resisted Bolshevik
policies or rejected them in soviet elections, then the working class
was "wavering" and being influenced by "petty-bourgeois" and "backward"
elements. Vanguardism breeds elitism and, when combined with state
power, dictatorship.

State power, as anarchists have always stressed, means the delegation of
power into the hands of a few. This automatically produces a class
division in society -- those with power and those without. As such, once
in power the Bolsheviks were isolated from the working class. The
Russian Revolution confirmed Malatesta's argument that a *"government,
that is a group of people entrusted with making laws and empowered to
use the collective power to oblige each individual to obey them, is
already a privileged class and cut off from the people. As any
constituted body would do, it will instinctively seek to extend its
powers, to be beyond public control, to impose its own policies and to
give priority to its special interests. Having been put in a privileged
position, the government is already at odds with the people whose
strength it disposes of."* \[**Anarchy**, p. 34\] A highly centralised
state such as the Bolsheviks built would reduce accountability to a
minimum while at the same time accelerating the isolation of the rulers
from the ruled. The masses were no longer a source of inspiration and
power, but rather an alien group whose lack of "discipline" (i.e.
ability to follow orders) placed the revolution in danger. As one
Russian Anarchist argued:

> *"The proletariat is being gradually enserfed by the state. The people
> are being transformed into servants over whom there has arisen a new
> class of administrators -- a new class born mainly form the womb of
> the so-called intelligentsia . . . We do not mean to say . . . that
> the Bolshevik party set out to create a new class system. But we do
> say that even the best intentions and aspirations must inevitably be
> smashed against the evils inherent in any system of centralised power.
> The separation of management from labour, the division between
> administrators and workers flows logically from centralisation. It
> cannot be otherwise."* \[**The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution**,
> pp. 123-4\]

For this reason anarchists, while agreeing that there is an uneven
development of political ideas within the working class, reject the idea
that "revolutionaries" should take power on behalf of working people.
Only when working people actually run society themselves will a
revolution be successful. For anarchists, this meant that
*"\[e\]ffective emancipation can be achieved only by the **direct,
widespread, and independent action** . . . **of the workers
themselves**, grouped . . . in their own class organisations . . . on
the basis of concrete action and self-government, **helped but not
governed**, by revolutionaries working in the very midst of, and not
above the mass and the professional, technical, defence and other
branches."* \[Voline, **Op. Cit.**, p. 197\] By substituting party power
for workers power, the Russian Revolution had made its first fatal step.
Little wonder that the following prediction (from November 1917) made by
anarchists in Russia came true:

> *"Once their power is consolidated and 'legalised', the Bolsheviks who
> are . . . men of centralist and authoritarian action will begin to
> rearrange the life of the country and of the people by governmental
> and dictatorial methods, imposed by the centre. The\[y\] . . . will
> dictate the will of the party to all Russia, and command the whole
> nation. Your Soviets and your other local organisations will become
> little by little, simply executive organs of the will of the central
> government. In the place of healthy, constructive work by the
> labouring masses, in place of free unification from the bottom, we
> will see the installation of an authoritarian and statist apparatus
> which would act from above and set about wiping out everything that
> stood in its way with an iron hand."* \[quoted by Voline, **Op.
> Cit.**, p. 235\]

The so-called "workers' state" could not be participatory or empowering
for working class people (as the Marxists claimed) simply because state
structures are not designed for that. Created as instruments of minority
rule, they cannot be transformed into (nor "new" ones created which are)
a means of liberation for the working classes. As Kropotkin put it,
Anarchists *"maintain that the State organisation, having been the force
to which minorities resorted for establishing and organising their power
over the masses, cannot be the force which will serve to destroy these
privileges."* \[**Anarchism**, p. 170\] In the words of an anarchist
pamphlet written in 1918:

> *"Bolshevism, day by day and step by step, proves that state power
> possesses inalienable characteristics; it can change its label, its
> 'theory', and its servitors, but in essence it merely remains power
> and despotism in new forms."* \[quoted by Paul Avrich, *"The
> Anarchists in the Russian Revolution,"* pp. 341-350, **Russian
> Review**, vol. 26, issue no. 4, p. 347\]

For insiders, the Revolution had died a few months after the Bolsheviks
took over. To the outside world, the Bolsheviks and the USSR came to
represent "socialism" even as they systematically destroyed the basis of
real socialism. By transforming the soviets into state bodies,
substituting party power for soviet power, undermining the factory
committees, eliminating democracy in the armed forces and workplaces,
repressing the political opposition and workers' protests, the
Bolsheviks effectively marginalised the working class from its own
revolution. Bolshevik ideology and practice were themselves important
and sometimes decisive factors in the degeneration of the revolution and
the ultimate rise of Stalinism.

As anarchists had predicted for decades previously, in the space of a
few months, and before the start of the Civil War, the Bolshevik's
"workers' state" had become, like any state, an alien power **over** the
working class and an instrument of minority rule (in this case, the rule
of the party). The Civil War accelerated this process and soon party
dictatorship was introduced (indeed, leading Bolsheviks began arguing
that it was essential in any revolution). The Bolsheviks put down the
libertarian socialist elements within their country, with the crushing
of the uprising at Kronstadt and the Makhnovist movement in the Ukraine
being the final nails in the coffin of socialism and the subjugation of
the soviets.

The Kronstadt uprising of February, 1921, was, for anarchists, of
immense importance (see the appendix "What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?"
for a full discussion of this uprising). The uprising started when the
sailors of Kronstadt supported the striking workers of Petrograd in
February, 1921. They raised a 15 point resolution, the first point of
which was a call for soviet democracy. The Bolsheviks slandered the
Kronstadt rebels as counter-revolutionaries and crushed the revolt. For
anarchists, this was significant as the repression could not be
justified in terms of the Civil War (which had ended months before) and
because it was a major uprising of ordinary people for **real**
socialism. As Voline puts it:

> *"Kronstadt was the first entirely independent attempt of the people
> to liberate themselves of all yokes and carry out the Social
> Revolution: this attempt was made directly . . . by the working masses
> themselves, without political shepherds, without leaders or tutors. It
> was the first step towards the third and social revolution."*
> \[Voline, **Op. Cit.**, pp. 537-8\]

In the <a href="Revolutionary_Ukraine" class="wikilink"
title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, anarchist ideas were most successfully
applied. In areas under the protection of the Makhnovist movement,
working class people organised their own lives directly, based on their
own ideas and needs -- true social self-determination. Under the
leadership of Nestor Makhno, a self-educated peasant, the movement not
only fought against both Red and White dictatorships but also resisted
the Ukrainian nationalists. In opposition to the call for "national
self-determination," i.e. a new Ukrainian state, Makhno called instead
for working class self-determination in the Ukraine and across the
world. Makhno inspired his fellow peasants and workers to fight for real
freedom:

> *"Conquer or die -- such is the dilemma that faces the Ukrainian
> peasants and workers at this historic moment . . . But we will not
> conquer in order to repeat the errors of the past years, the error of
> putting our fate into the hands of new masters; we will conquer in
> order to take our destinies into our own hands, to conduct our lives
> according to our own will and our own conception of the truth."*
> \[quoted by Peter Arshinov, **History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p.
> 58\]

To ensure this end, the Makhnovists refused to set up governments in the
towns and cities they liberated, instead urging the creation of free
soviets so that the working people could govern themselves. Taking the
example of Aleksandrovsk, once they had liberated the city the
Makhnovists *"immediately invited the working population to participate
in a general conference . . . it was proposed that the workers organise
the life of the city and the functioning of the factories with their own
forces and their own organisations . . . The first conference was
followed by a second. The problems of organising life according to
principles of self-management by workers were examined and discussed
with animation by the masses of workers, who all welcomed this ideas
with the greatest enthusiasm . . . Railroad workers took the first step
. . . They formed a committee charged with organising the railway
network of the region . . . From this point, the proletariat of
Aleksandrovsk began to turn systematically to the problem of creating
organs of self-management."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 149\]

The Makhnovists argued that the *"freedom of the workers and peasants is
their own, and not subject to any restriction. It is up to the workers
and peasants themselves to act, to organise themselves, to agree among
themselves in all aspects of their lives, as they see fit and desire . .
. The Makhnovists can do no more than give aid and counsel . . . In no
circumstances can they, nor do they wish to, govern."* \[Peter Arshinov,
quoted by Guerin, **Op. Cit.**, p. 99\] In Alexandrovsk, the Bolsheviks
proposed to the Makhnovists spheres of action - their Revkom
(Revolutionary Committee) would handle political affairs and the
Makhnovists military ones. Makhno advised them *"to go and take up some
honest trade instead of seeking to impose their will on the workers."*
\[Peter Arshinov in **The Anarchist Reader**, p. 141\]

They also organised free agricultural communes which *"\[a\]dmittedly .
. . were not numerous, and included only a minority of the population .
. . But what was most precious was that these communes were formed by
the poor peasants themselves. The Makhnovists never exerted any pressure
on the peasants, confining themselves to propagating the idea of free
communes."* \[Arshinov, **History of the Makhnovist Movement**, p. 87\]
Makhno played an important role in abolishing the holdings of the landed
gentry. The local soviet and their district and regional congresses
equalised the use of the land between all sections of the peasant
community. \[**Op. Cit.**, pp. 53-4\]

Moreover, the Makhnovists took the time and energy to involve the whole
population in discussing the development of the revolution, the
activities of the army and social policy. They organised numerous
conferences of workers', soldiers' and peasants' delegates to discuss
political and social issues as well as free soviets, unions and
communes. They organised a regional congress of peasants and workers
when they had liberated Aleksandrovsk. When the Makhnovists tried to
convene the third regional congress of peasants, workers and insurgents
in April 1919 and an extraordinary congress of several regions in June
1919 the Bolsheviks viewed them as counter-revolutionary, tried to ban
them and declared their organisers and delegates outside the law.

The Makhnovists replied by holding the conferences anyway and asking
*"\[c\]an there exist laws made by a few people who call themselves
revolutionaries, which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are more
revolutionary than they are themselves?" and "\[w\]hose interests should
the revolution defend: those of the Party or those of the people who set
the revolution in motion with their blood?" Makhno himself stated that
he "consider\[ed\] it an inviolable right of the workers and peasants, a
right won by the revolution, to call conferences on their own account,
to discuss their affairs."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 103 and p. 129\]

In addition, the Makhnovists *"fully applied the revolutionary
principles of freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of
political association. In all cities and towns occupied by the
Makhnovists, they began by lifting all the prohibitions and repealing
all the restrictions imposed on the press and on political organisations
by one or another power."* Indeed, the *"only restriction that the
Makhnovists considered necessary to impose on the Bolsheviks, the left
Socialist-Revolutionaries and other statists was a prohibition on the
formation of those 'revolutionary committees' which sought to impose a
dictatorship over the people."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 153 and p. 154\]

The Makhnovists rejected the Bolshevik corruption of the soviets and
instead proposed *"the free and completely independent soviet system of
working people without authorities and their arbitrary laws." Their
proclamations stated that the "working people themselves must freely
choose their own soviets, which carry out the will and desires of the
working people themselves, that is to say. ADMINISTRATIVE, not ruling
soviets."* Economically, capitalism would be abolished along with the
state - the land and workshops *"must belong to the working people
themselves, to those who work in them, that is to say, they must be
socialised."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 271 and p. 273\]

The army itself, in stark contrast to the Red Army, was fundamentally
democratic (although, of course, the horrific nature of the civil war
did result in a few deviations from the ideal -- however, compared to
the regime imposed on the Red Army by Trotsky, the Makhnovists were much
more democratic movement).

The anarchist experiment of self-management in the Ukraine came to a
bloody end when the Bolsheviks turned on the Makhnovists (their former
allies against the "Whites," or pro-Tsarists) when they were no longer
needed. This important movement is fully discussed in the appendix "Why
does the Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to
Bolshevism?" of our FAQ. However, we must stress here the one obvious
lesson of the Makhnovist movement, namely that the dictatorial policies
pursued by the Bolsheviks were not imposed on them by objective
circumstances. Rather, the political ideas of Bolshevism had a clear
influence in the decisions they made. After all, the Makhnovists were
active in the same Civil War and yet did not pursue the same policies of
party power as the Bolsheviks did. Rather, they successfully encouraged
working class freedom, democracy and power in extremely difficult
circumstances (and in the face of strong Bolshevik opposition to those
policies). The received wisdom on the left is that there was no
alternative open to the Bolsheviks. The experience of the Makhnovists
disproves this. What the masses of people, as well as those in power, do
and think politically is as much part of the process determining the
outcome of history as are the objective obstacles that limit the choices
available. Clearly, ideas do matter and, as such, the Makhnovists show
that there was (and is) a practical alternative to Bolshevism --
anarchism.

The last anarchist march in Moscow until 1987 took place at the funeral
of Kropotkin in 1921, when over 10,000 marched behind his coffin. They
carried black banners declaring *"Where there is authority, there is no
freedom" and "The Liberation of the working class is the task of the
workers themselves."* As the procession passed the Butyrki prison, the
inmates sang anarchist songs and shook the bars of their cells.

Anarchist opposition within Russia to the Bolshevik regime started in
1918. They were the first left-wing group to be repressed by the new
"revolutionary" regime. Outside of Russia, anarchists continued to
support the Bolsheviks until news came from anarchist sources about the
repressive nature of the Bolshevik regime (until then, many had
discounted negative reports as being from pro-capitalist sources). Once
these reliable reports came in, anarchists across the globe rejected
Bolshevism and its system of party power and repression. The experience
of Bolshevism confirmed Bakunin's prediction that Marxism meant *"the
highly despotic government of the masses by a new and very small
aristocracy of real or pretended scholars. The people are not learned,
so they will be liberated from the cares of government and included in
entirety in the governed herd."* \[**Statism and Anarchy**, pp. 178-9\]

From about 1921 on, anarchists outside of Russia started describing the
USSR as *"state-capitalist"* to indicate that although individual bosses
might have been eliminated, the Soviet state bureaucracy played the same
role as individual bosses do in the West (anarchists within Russia had
been calling it that since 1918). For anarchists, *"the Russian
revolution . . . is trying to reach . . . economic equality . . . this
effort has been made in Russia under a strongly centralised party
dictatorship . . . this effort to build a communist republic on the
basis of a strongly centralised state communism under the iron law of a
party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know
in Russia how not to introduce communism."* \[**Anarchism**, p. 254\]

This meant exposing that Berkman called **"The Bolshevik Myth,"** the
idea that the Russian Revolution was a success and should be copied by
revolutionaries in other countries: *"It is imperative to unmask the
great delusion, which otherwise might lead the Western workers to the
same abyss as their brothers \[and sisters\] in Russia. It is incumbent
upon those who have seen through the myth to expose its true nature."*
\[*"The Anti-Climax'",* **The Bolshevik Myth**, p. 342\] Moreover,
anarchists felt that it was their revolutionary duty not only present
and learn from the facts of the revolution but also show solidarity with
those subject to Bolshevik dictatorship. As Emma Goldman argued, she had
not *"come to Russia expecting to find Anarchism realised."* Such
idealism was alien to her (although that has not stopped Leninists
saying the opposite). Rather, she expected to see *"the beginnings of
the social changes for which the Revolution had been fought."* She was
aware that revolutions were difficult, involving *"destruction"* and
*"violence."* That Russia was not perfect was not the source of her
vocal opposition to Bolshevism. Rather, it was the fact that *"the
Russian people have been locked out" of their own revolution by the
Bolshevik state which used "the sword and the gun to keep the people
out." As a revolutionary she refused "to side with the master class,
which in Russia is called the Communist Party."* \[**My Disillusionment
in Russia**, p. xlvii and p. xliv\]

For more information on the Russian Revolution and the role played by
anarchists, see the appendix on "The Russian Revolution" of the FAQ. As
well as covering the Kronstadt uprising and the Makhnovists, it
discusses why the revolution failed, the role of Bolshevik ideology
played in that failure and whether there were any alternatives to
Bolshevism.

The following books are also recommended: **The Unknown Revolution** by
Voline; **The Guillotine at Work** by G.P. Maximov; **The Bolshevik
Myth** and **The Russian Tragedy**, both by Alexander Berkman; **The
Bolsheviks and Workers Control** by M. Brinton; **The Kronstadt
Uprising** by Ida Mett; **The History of the Makhnovist Movement** by
Peter Arshinov; **My Disillusionment in Russia** and **Living My Life**
by Emma Goldman; **Nestor Makhno Anarchy's Cossack: The struggle for
free soviets in the Ukraine 1917-1921** by Alexandre Skirda.

Many of these books were written by anarchists active during the
revolution, many imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and deported to the West
due to international pressure exerted by anarcho-syndicalist delegates
to Moscow who the Bolsheviks were trying to win over to Leninism. The
majority of such delegates stayed true to their libertarian politics and
convinced their unions to reject Bolshevism and break with Moscow. By
the early 1920's all the anarcho-syndicalist union confederations had
joined with the anarchists in rejecting the "socialism" in Russia as
state capitalism and party dictatorship.
