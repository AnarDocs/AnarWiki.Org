*"In today’s world, wolves still experience the joys that come from
sharing. Maybe that’s why governments pay bounties to the killers of
wolves." -Freddy Perlman*[^1]

The gray wolf (Canis lupus), commonly known as *wolf*, practices mutual
aid and has a mostly non-coercive social organization, defying popular
conceptions of there being a rigid pack hierarchy. Wolves are playful
with each other and with many other species. Their presence in
ecosystems helps the ecological richness and diversity and carbon
sequestration.

Wolves are native to North America, Europe, Asia and North Africa.[^2].

# Structure

In the wild, a wolf pack is generally a family with parents at the lead
and offspring following. As early as nine months old, pups leave to
start their own packs. Occasionally a pack may adopt an outside pup or a
new parent to replace one who has died. Undermining conceptions of rigid
wolf pack hierarchies, wolves tend to have a non-coercive social
structures.

The biologist and ecologist L. David Mech, who observed wolves in the
field for 13 summers and reviewed scientific literature, disputes the
mainstream idea that the parents are coercive "alpha" leaders: "The
point here is not so much the terminology but what the terminology
falsely implies: a rigid, force-based dominance hierarchy." According to
Mech, research showing wolf hierarchy tends to come not from the field
but from wolves in captivity who are forced to stay together longer than
they normally would.[^3]

The nature writer Barry Lopez claims that wild wolves have a consensual
rather than coercive structure. He writes:

> "But the term *alpha* - evolved to describe captive animals - is still
> misleading. Alpha animals do not always lead the hunt, break trail in
> snow, or eat before the others do. An alpha animal may be alpha only
> at certain times, and it should be noted, is alpha at the deference of
> the other wolves in the pack. The wolf is a social animal; it depends
> for its survival on cooperation, not strife...The social structure of
> a wolf pack is dynamic - subject to change, especially during the
> breeding season - and may be completely reversed during periods of
> play. [^4]

Lopez points out the females make the decisions about where to den and
where to hunt: "Females may head packs and they always strongly
influence pack activity."[^5] At various points, the alpha male and
alpha female wolf display submissive postures to each other.[^6] At most
times, the alpha female displays a submissive posture toward the alpha
male, but the male displays a submissive posture to the female when she
is raising young pups who are still in the den.

> the breeding female tending young pups. On 26 June 1990, I observed
> the breeding male walk toward the female in the den "excitedly wagging

A wolf pack will commonly punish an alpha leader who was dominant or
abusive. They will temporarily make him the "omega" wolf who has to
trail the pack at a distance for a while before being re-integrated into
the pack.[^8]

Psychologists Friederike Range and Zsófia Virányi found that in contrast
to dogs, captive wolves cooperate extensively and do not create rigid
hierarchies. Range says wolves "are very cooperative with each other,
and when they have a disagreement or must make a group decision, they
have a lot of communication or ‘talk’ first".[^9]

# Mutual Aid and Play

Wolves are profoundly social and cooperative animals. In 1576, a hunter
observed, "If the pups chance to meet their sire or dam anytime after
leave the pack they will fawn upon them and seem in their kind greatly
to rejoice."[^10]

From hunting to playing, wolves practice mutual aid extensively. Peter
Kropotkin describes their hunt:

> It is well known, in fact, that wolves gather in packs for hunting,
> and Tschudi left an excellent description of how they draw up in a
> half-circle, surround a cow which is grazing on a mountain slope, and
> then, suddenly appearing with a loud barking, make it roll in the
> abyss. Audubon, in the thirties, also saw the Labrador wolves hunting
> in packs, and one pack following a man to his cabin, and killing the
> dogs. During severe winters the packs of wolves grow so numerous as to
> become a danger for human settlements, as was the case in France some
> five-and-forty years ago. In the Russian Steppes they never attack the
> horses otherwise than in packs; and yet they have to sustain bitter
> fights, during which the horses (according to Kohl's testimony)
> sometimes assume offensive warfare, and in such cases, if the wolves
> do not retreat promptly, they run the risk of being surrounded by the
> horses and killed by their hoofs.[^11]

From puphood to adulthood, wolves play games with and pranks on each
other. Barry Lopez describes some of their antics:

> Even as adults, wolves play tag with each other or romp with the
> pups....They scare each other by pouncing on sleeping wolves and by
> jumping in fornt of one another from hiding places. They bring things
> to each other, especially bits of food. They prance and parade with
> sticks or stones in their mouth.[^12]

Wolves' well-known howling and scent-marking are also social activities.
They howl to assemble the pack and to locate each other. The howl can
carry as many as six miles.[^13] Wolves urinate to leave scent marks
that are popularly though to mark territory to outsiders. Primarily,
these scent marks are actually meant to tell the rest of the pack,
especially the younger pups, where each other are.[^14]

# Neighboring Societies

Wolves contribute to ecosystemic stability and have a playful
relationship with several other species. Research by William J. Ripple
and Robert L. Beschta indicates that wolves' predation of ungulates
(including moose, sheep, antelope, bison, mule and elk) protects
Yellowstone's biodiversity. Since the park reintroduced wolves, elk keep
within in a smaller area than they did when they had no fear of wolf
predation. As a result, the ungulates eat less aspen, cottonwood and
willow, allowing for the recovery of wetland diversity and beaver
populations. [^15]

Researchers estimate that restoring the wolf population of North
America, by restricting the movement of herbivores who eat
carbon-sequestering plants, would lead to the annual sequestration of as
much carbon 30 to 70 million cars emit.[^16]

Wolves have a playful relationship with ravens, who follow wolf packs in
order to eat the remnants of the wolves' food. Mech explains how the two
species interact:

> The birds would dive at a wolf's head or tail and the wolf would duck
> and then leap at them. Sometimes the ravens chased the wolves, flying
> just above their heads, and once, a raven waddled to a resting wolf,
> pecked at its tail, and jumped aside as the wolf snapped at it. When
> the wolf retaliated by stalking the raven, the bird allowed it within
> a foot before arising. Then it landed a few feet beyond the wolf, and
> repeated the prank.[^17]

Residents in and around Juneau, Alaska report that, starting in 2003, a
wild wolf, who they named Romeo, would repeatedly visit to play with
domesticated dogs. The neighbors became comfortable letting their dogs
play with the wolf. These playful interactions continued for six years
until Romeo's death.[^18]

In 2013, a photographer in Finland photographed a wolf and a brown bear
who shared food and hung out together for at least ten days. Other bears
welcomed the wolf.[^19]

For many thousands of years, the indigenous Crow, Shoshone, Bannock and
Nez Pearce peoples coexisted with the wolves in what would become
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho of the United States. In establishing
Yellowstone National Park, the US government violently cleared
indigenous people from much of their traditional land. [^20] The
government did not ban wolf hunting in Yellowstone, and by 1926 hunters
and government-run predator control programs had wiped out Yellowstone's
entire wolf population. In 1995, the US re-introduced wolves into
Yellowstone. Although the 1973 Endangered Species Act has protected
wolves to some degree, the Obama administration decided to allow wolf
hunting in the areas surrounding Yellowstone. As a result, 14 of the
park's wolves (12 percent of the population) had been subsequently
trapped or shot as of of October 2013. [^21]

In 2013, the anarchist/anti-authoritarian group Earth First! published a
"Wolf Hunt Sabotage Manual" with instructions for disrupting wolf hunts.
Describing themselves as "hunters and proud of it," the anonymous
authors wrote, "But we aren’t proud of what passes for hunting these
days and especially for what passes as ‘sportsman’ hunting. Somehow, the
National Rifle Association, yuppie trophy hunters, cattle barons, and
the Obama Administration are in cahoots in an effort that promises to
wipe wolves clean off the planet. And in that case, we choose to be
saboteurs for the wild." [^22]
