# Commons

**Commons** (also known as **Common**, **Collective** or **Community
Ownership**) refers to cultural and natural resources accessible to all
members of a community, including natural materials such as air, water,
land, and forests. These resources are managed collectively by
communities through democratic self-governance, rather than by the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> or through
"<a   href="Private_Ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">"private property</a>. The commons represents a
fundamental alternative to both capitalist private ownership and state
control, embodying principles central to
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a> and
"<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">"libertarian socialism</a>.

## Definition

The commons can be understood as both a resource and a social practice.
As resources, commons include natural materials like grazing lands,
fisheries, and water sources, as well as cultural resources like
knowledge, software, and public spaces. As a practice, commoning refers
to the collective management of these resources through
community-created institutions and democratic processes.[^1]

Unlike "<a   href="open_access.md" class="wikilink" title="open access">"open
access</a> resources (which anyone can use without restriction), commons
have a defined community of users who collectively establish rules for
access and use. This community self-governance distinguishes commons
from both unregulated open access and top-down state management.

The term derives from traditional English
"<a   href="common_land.md" class="wikilink" title="common land">"common
land</a>, but the practice of commons management extends across cultures
and throughout human history. The Roman legal concept of *res communis*
(things common to all) recognized resources meant to be used and enjoyed
by everyone, distinct from *res publica* (public property managed by
government).[^2]

## Historical Commons

### Common Land Systems

Contrary to capitalist propaganda, historical commons were highly
successful systems of collective resource management that functioned for
centuries. In medieval England, common lands were integral to manor
systems, with communities developing sophisticated customary laws to
prevent overuse. Manorial courts enforced rules about grazing limits,
harvest timing, and resource allocation.[^3]

These systems were **not** examples of unregulated access leading to
depletion. Rather, they demonstrated that communities could effectively
self-govern shared resources without private ownership or state control.
The success of commons management for hundreds of years directly refutes
claims that collective ownership inevitably fails.

### Enclosure and Dispossession

The destruction of the commons came not through internal failure but
through violent
"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">"enclosure</a> -
the privatization of common lands by force. Beginning in the 16th
century and accelerating through the 18th and 19th centuries, European
governments (particularly in Britain) seized common lands and granted
them to private owners, dispossessing rural communities of their
traditional rights.

"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a>
identified enclosure as a form of "primitive accumulation" - the violent
separation of people from their means of subsistence necessary for
capitalism to develop. He noted that enclosure merely displaced problems
while putting increasing numbers in precarious conditions.[^4]

This historical pattern continues today as corporations and governments
use the false narrative of
""<a   href="tragedy_of_the_commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="tragedy of the commons">"tragedy of the commons</a>" to justify
seizing indigenous lands, privatizing water sources, and enclosing
digital resources.

## Successful Commons Management

### Elinor Ostrom's Research

Political scientist
"<a   href="Elinor_Ostrom.md" class="wikilink" title="Elinor Ostrom">"Elinor
Ostrom</a> won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics for demonstrating that
**commons frequently succeed** where theory predicted they would fail.
Her extensive research documented hundreds of examples of communities
successfully managing shared resources for generations.[^5]

Ostrom identified eight key principles for successful commons:

1.  **Clearly defined boundaries** - clear definition of the resource
    and who has rights to it
2.  **Proportional equivalence** - appropriation and provision rules
    adapted to local conditions
3.  **Collective decision-making** - most appropriators can participate
    in rule-making
4.  **Monitoring** - monitors are accountable to or are the
    appropriators themselves
5.  **Graduated sanctions** - rule violators face escalating
    consequences
6.  **Conflict resolution** - accessible, low-cost mechanisms for
    resolving disputes
7.  **Recognition of rights** - external authorities recognize the
    community's right to self-organize
8.  **Nested enterprises** - for larger resources, organization in
    multiple layers with local control at the base[^6]

These principles align closely with
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
organizational structures emphasizing decentralized decision-making,
community accountability, and federation.

### Contemporary Examples

**Swiss Alpine Commons** - Grazing lands in the Swiss Alps have been
collectively managed by farmer communities since 1517, demonstrating
centuries of successful commons governance.[^7]

**Mongolian Grasslands** - Research comparing land degradation in
Mongolia, Russia, and China found that Mongolian grasslands (managed
communally with seasonal movement) had only 9% degradation, while
Russian state-owned pastures had 75% degradation and Chinese
privatized/state pastures had 33% degradation. Collective management
proved far more sustainable.[^8]

**Maine Lobster Fishery** - The thriving Maine lobster industry operates
through community-created regulations, including harbor territories,
informal trap limits, and self-policing. Local fishers collectively
manage the resource with minimal government intervention, demonstrating
effective commons governance.[^9]

**Acequia Systems** - In New Mexico, community-run Acequia Associations
manage irrigation water through collective responsibility. These systems
preserve water as a common resource while reinforcing agricultural
traditions and democratic participation.[^10]

**Community Forests in Nepal** - Since the 1980s, Nepal has transferred
forest management to local communities. Community forest user groups
regulate harvesting, generate income for community development, and have
increased forest cover in many areas while advancing democratic
practices at the grassroots level.[^11]

**James Bay Beaver Hunting** - Indigenous communities in James Bay,
Quebec maintain extensive customary systems for regulating beaver
hunting territories, demonstrating effective resource sharing through
traditional commons management.[^12]

## Types of Commons

### Natural Resource Commons

Natural commons include land, forests, water sources, fisheries, grazing
areas, and the atmosphere. These are the traditional commons that
sustained human communities for millennia before enclosure and
privatization.

Key natural commons today include:

- **Water** - rivers, aquifers, irrigation systems
- **Forests** - timber, non-timber products, biodiversity
- **Fisheries** - ocean and freshwater fish stocks
- **Grazing lands** - pastures for livestock
- **Seeds and biodiversity** - genetic resources for agriculture
- **Atmosphere** - air quality and climate stability

### Urban Commons

Urban commons reframe city resources based on use value and community
need rather than market value.
"<a   href="David_Harvey.md" class="wikilink" title="David Harvey">"David
Harvey</a> distinguishes between mere public spaces and true urban
commons - the latter emerge when citizens take political action to
assert collective control.[^13]

Examples of urban commons include:

- **Occupied public squares** -
  "<a   href="Syntagma_Square.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Syntagma Square">"Syntagma Square</a> (Athens),
  "<a   href="Tahrir_Square.md" class="wikilink" title="Tahrir Square">"Tahrir
  Square</a> (Cairo), "<a   href="Plaza_de_Catalunya.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Plaza de Catalunya">"Plaza de Catalunya</a> (Barcelona)
  transformed from public spaces to commons through revolutionary
  protest
- **Community gardens** - collectively managed urban agriculture
- **Social centers** - self-managed cultural and political spaces
- **Streets** - reclaimed through protest and direct action for
  collective use
- **Squatted housing** - buildings occupied and managed communally

Urban commons demonstrate how communities can assert control over city
resources in complementary opposition to both state and market.

### Digital Commons

Digital commons encompass information and knowledge resources
collectively created and shared within communities. These represent new
frontiers for commons-based organizing that challenge hierarchical
production and enable "<a   href="horizontal_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="horizontal organization">"horizontal organization</a>.[^14]

Digital commons are significant because:

- **Non-rivalrous nature** - digital resources can be shared at minimal
  cost without depletion
- **Decentralized production** - enables peer-to-peer collaboration
  without bosses or markets
- **Democratic participation** - contributors can directly influence
  governance
- **Counter-hegemonic potential** - builds alternatives to corporate
  control of knowledge

Key examples include:

- **"<a   href="Wikipedia.md" class="wikilink" title="Wikipedia">"Wikipedia</a>** -
  collectively maintained encyclopedia representing "commons-based peer
  production"
- **"<a   href="Free_and_open_source_software.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Free and open source software">"Free and open source software</a>** -
  collaboratively developed code like Linux, Mozilla
- **"<a   href="Open-source_hardware.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Open-source hardware">"Open-source hardware</a>** - shared
  technical designs like RepRap 3D printers
- **Open access publishing** - freely available research and scholarship
- **Creative Commons licensing** - legal tools for sharing creative
  works

Scholar
"<a   href="Yochai_Benkler.md" class="wikilink" title="Yochai Benkler">"Yochai
Benkler</a> describes this as "commons-based peer production" - a system
of decentralized individual action through non-market means that
challenges traditional hierarchies.[^15]

### Cultural and Knowledge Commons

Cultural commons include literature, music, arts, film, and sites of
heritage. These commons resist the commodification of culture and assert
collective ownership of cultural production and heritage.

Knowledge commons encompass research, education, traditional ecological
knowledge, and shared information. They challenge intellectual property
regimes that privatize knowledge and restrict access.

### Global Commons

Global commons include resources that transcend national boundaries: the
oceans, Antarctica, outer space, and the atmosphere. These pose
particular challenges for commons governance given their scale, but also
represent areas where commons-based approaches offer alternatives to
both state sovereignty and corporate exploitation.

## Commoning as Practice

### Process Over Property

Contemporary theorists emphasize *commoning* as a verb - an active
practice rather than just a type of property.
"<a   href="David_Harvey.md" class="wikilink" title="David Harvey">"David
Harvey</a> and others use this framing to highlight the commons as an
ongoing social process of collective governance rather than a static
entity.[^16]

Commoning involves:

- **Creating institutions** - communities develop rules and procedures
  democratically
- **Collective decision-making** - participants govern resources
  together
- **Mutual aid** - sharing and reciprocity among commoners
- **Resistance to enclosure** - defending commons against privatization
- **Subjectivization** - producing ourselves as common subjects through
  collective practice[^17]

This process-oriented understanding connects commons to anarchist
principles of
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>,
and "<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a> - creating the
new world in the shell of the old.

### Social Norms and Governance

Commons governance relies on informal norms and social practice rather
than state enforcement or market mechanisms. Communities develop and
transmit customary knowledge about sustainable use, conflict resolution,
and collective responsibility.

This self-governance demonstrates that communities can organize complex
resource management without hierarchical authority - a core anarchist
insight. Monitoring and enforcement come from within the community
rather than external authorities.

## Feminist Perspectives

### Women and Commons

"<a   href="Silvia_Federici.md" class="wikilink"
title="Silvia Federici">"Silvia Federici</a> articulates the centrality
of women to commons struggles in her essay "Feminism and the Politics of
the Commons." She argues that women have historically been at the
forefront of defending commons "as primary subjects of reproductive
work" - the labor of sustaining life and community.[^18]

Women's proximity to and dependence on communal natural resources has
made them both most vulnerable to privatization and most steadfast in
resistance. Examples include:

- **Subsistence agriculture** - women's farming on common lands
- **Water collection** - defending communal water sources
- **Foraging** - gathering food, fuel, and medicines from forests
- **"<a   href="Tontine.md" class="wikilink" title="Tontine">"Tontines</a>** -
  rotating savings and credit associations (money commons)
- **Collectivized reproductive labor** - sharing childcare, cooking,
  eldercare

### Enclosure and Patriarchy

Federici connects the enclosure of commons to the intensification of
patriarchal control. As common lands were privatized, women lost
traditional autonomy and economic independence. The destruction of
commons coincided with witch hunts and increased restrictions on women's
lives.

She argues that any effective commons movement must center women's
leadership in organizing collective alternatives to capitalist
exploitation, particularly around reproductive labor and the means of
subsistence.

### Reproductive Commons

Feminist analysis highlights **reproductive commons** - the collective
resources and practices that sustain life: childcare, cooking,
healthcare, education, emotional labor. Federici calls for
collectivizing this work as a commons rather than privatizing it within
nuclear families or commodifying it through markets.

This connects to broader anarchist visions of communal living and
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
networks that socialize reproductive labor.

## Anarchist Analysis

### Commons and Anarchism

The commons embody key anarchist principles:

- **Self-management** - communities govern resources directly without
  state control
- **Voluntary association** - people freely organize to manage shared
  resources
- **Horizontal organization** - decision-making power distributed among
  participants
- **Direct democracy** - those affected by decisions participate in
  making them
- **Federation** - larger commons organized through nested layers
  maintaining local autonomy
- **Mutual aid** - cooperation for collective benefit without profit
  motive

Scholar Kevin Carson identifies extensive anarchist themes in Ostrom's
work on commons, noting the alignment between successful commons
governance and anarchist organizing principles.[^19]

### Contemporary Anarchist Commons

Large-scale contemporary examples of commons-based organizing heavily
influenced by anarchism include:

**"<a   href="Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md" class="wikilink"
title="Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities">"Rebel Zapatista
Autonomous Municipalities</a>** - The Zapatista communities in Chiapas,
Mexico operate on commons principles, with land held communally and
decisions made through participatory assemblies. Their motto "everything
for everyone, nothing for us" reflects commons values.

**"<a   href="Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria">"Autonomous
Administration of North and East Syria</a>** (Rojava) - The
revolutionary society in northern Syria practices democratic
confederalism with communal land ownership, cooperatives, and
commons-based resource management influenced by
"<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">"libertarian socialism</a> and
"<a   href="ecosocialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="ecosocialism">"ecosocialism</a>.

Both demonstrate that commons-based organizing can function at
significant scale, providing real alternatives to state and capitalist
systems.

### Squatting and Land Liberation

Movements practicing direct action to reclaim land as commons include:

- **"<a   href="Abahlali_baseMjondolo.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Abahlali baseMjondolo">"Abahlali baseMjondolo</a>** - shack
  dwellers' movement in South Africa fighting for housing as a commons
- **"<a   href="Landless_Workers&#39;_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Landless Workers&#39; Movement">"Landless Workers' Movement</a>**
  (MST) - occupying unused land in Brazil and establishing collective
  farms
- **"<a   href="Take_Back_the_Land.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Take Back the Land">"Take Back the Land</a>** - liberating
  vacant housing in the United States
- **"<a   href="The_Land_is_Ours.md" class="wikilink" title="The Land is Ours">"The
  Land is Ours</a>** - occupying unused land in the UK for community use
- **"<a   href="Occupy_movement.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Occupy movement">"Occupy movement</a>** - asserting public space
  as commons through direct action

These movements prefigure anarchist society by creating commons through
collective action rather than petitioning authorities.

## Defending the Commons

### Against Enclosure

The ongoing enclosure of commons continues through:

- **Land grabs** - corporations and states seizing indigenous
  territories
- **Privatization** - selling public resources to private companies
- **Intellectual property** - copyright and patents enclosing knowledge
- **Financialization** - turning resources into tradeable assets
- **Development schemes** - displacing communities in the name of
  "progress"

Defending commons requires active resistance to these enclosures through
direct action, legal challenges, and building alternative institutions.

### The "Tragedy" Narrative

The ""<a   href="tragedy_of_the_commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="tragedy of the commons">"tragedy of the commons</a>" functions as
propaganda justifying enclosure. As detailed in that article, this
narrative is historically false and empirically disproven. It is wielded
to dispossess indigenous peoples, privatize resources, and undermine
collective alternatives to capitalism.

Commons advocates must actively counter this narrative by highlighting
successful commons and explaining how privatization and state control -
not collective management - cause resource depletion and environmental
destruction.

### Strategies for Defense

Effective defense of commons includes:

- **Direct action** - occupying lands, blocking privatization
- **Legal recognition** - securing community rights (while not depending
  solely on law)
- **Documentation** - recording commons management practices and
  outcomes
- **Building alliances** - connecting struggles across movements and
  regions
- **Creating alternatives** - establishing new commons as prefigurative
  projects
- **Education** - sharing knowledge about successful commons

## Commons and Ecosocialism

Commons-based resource management offers solutions to ecological crisis
that neither state environmentalism nor green capitalism can provide.
Successful commons demonstrate that communities with direct
relationships to resources practice sustainable management because they
depend on long-term health of those resources.

### Indigenous Commons

Indigenous peoples worldwide maintain commons-based resource management
systems developed over millennia. These systems embody sophisticated
ecological knowledge and demonstrate sustainable relationships between
humans and nature.

Douglas L. Johnson's research on nomadic pastoralists shows they
"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in
ways that were ecologically sound" - yet "the nomad was blamed for
problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien
forces."[^20]

Defending indigenous commons means supporting indigenous sovereignty and
self-determination against state and corporate enclosure.

### Climate Commons

The atmosphere represents a global commons threatened by capitalist
overproduction. Addressing climate change requires transitioning from
private/state control of resources to commons-based management that
prioritizes ecological sustainability over profit.

Peter Barnes proposes "sky trusts" - commons-based approaches to
atmospheric resources that charge polluters and distribute proceeds to
all, creating incentives for reducing emissions.[^21]

## Building Commons

### Creating New Commons

Anarchists can create commons through:

- **Land occupations** - liberating unused land for collective use
- **Housing cooperatives** - removing housing from market through
  collective ownership
- **Worker cooperatives** - managing workplaces as commons
- **Community centers** - creating commons for cultural and political
  activity
- **Tool libraries** - sharing equipment communally
- **Skill sharing** - teaching and learning outside market systems
- **Free schools** - education as commons
- **Free stores and food banks** - distributing resources based on need

These projects prefigure anarchist society and provide material support
for resistance struggles.

### Digital Commons Building

Creating digital commons involves:

- **Free/open source development** - building software collectively
- **Knowledge sharing** - open access publishing and education
- **Platform cooperativism** - worker-owned alternatives to corporate
  platforms
- **Decentralized networks** - peer-to-peer infrastructure outside
  corporate control
- **Creative commons licensing** - enabling sharing of creative works
- **Commons-based fabrication** - open-source hardware and local
  manufacturing

Digital commons connect traditional commons organizing with contemporary
technology, enabling global collaboration while maintaining local
autonomy.

### Coalition Building

Successful commons movements connect diverse struggles:

- **Land and housing** - rural and urban commons defenders
- **Digital rights** - free software and knowledge advocates
- **Labor movements** - workers seeking collective control
- **Indigenous movements** - defending traditional territories
- **Environmental justice** - communities resisting pollution and
  extraction
- **Feminist movements** - collectivizing reproductive labor

These coalitions strengthen resistance to enclosure while building
alternative institutions.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Scale Questions

Critics question whether commons can function at the scale of modern
societies. However, Ostrom's research demonstrates that nested,
federated commons can manage large resources through coordinated local
control - a model consistent with
"<a   href="anarchist_federalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist federalism">"anarchist federalism</a>.

Large-scale historical commons and contemporary examples like the
Zapatistas and Rojava demonstrate viability beyond small communities.

### External Threats

Commons face constant threats from:

- **State violence** - police and military suppression
- **Corporate enclosure** - privatization schemes
- **Market pressures** - economic incentives to commodify resources
- **Legal systems** - laws favoring private property over collective
  rights
- **Ideological attacks** - propaganda portraying commons as failures

Defending commons requires militant resistance and building power
through solidarity networks.

### Internal Challenges

Commons communities must address:

- **Inequality** - preventing hierarchies from emerging within commons
- **Inclusion** - ensuring participation across differences
- **Conflict resolution** - managing disputes without state authority
- **Free riders** - members who benefit without contributing
- **Changing conditions** - adapting to environmental and social changes

These challenges are navigable through anarchist principles of direct
democracy, consensus decision-making, and accountability structures.

## Vision

The commons point toward an anarchist future where resources are managed
collectively for the benefit of all rather than privately for profit or
by states for control. A society based on commons would feature:

- **Cooperative production** - workers collectively managing workplaces
  as commons
- **Communal land** - agriculture and housing organized communally
- **Shared knowledge** - information and culture freely accessible
- **Democratic governance** - those affected by decisions participating
  in making them
- **Ecological sustainability** - communities with direct stakes in
  local ecosystems
- **Material abundance** - needs met through cooperation rather than
  markets
- **Social solidarity** - relationships based on mutual aid rather than
  competition

This vision is not utopian speculation but builds on centuries of
successful commons management and contemporary movements demonstrating
viability of commons-based organizing.
