# DuckDuckGo's Policies

- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) promises to be a secure search
  engine that doesn't track you, doesn't collect or share personal info,
  and comes with [a lot of goodies](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies).
- [DontTrack.us](http://donttrack.us/) lays out the general problems
  with Google and how DuckDuckGo works in contrast.
- [DontBubble.us](http://dontbubble.us/) talks about [filter
  bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), which
  DuckDuckGo doesn't create.

## Goodies

- DuckDuckGo has a ton of [built-in
  "goodies"](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies) that allow you perform
  tasks, such as converting units and generating QR codes.
- Like the goodies, DDG has "bangs" which allow you to search other
  sites. Searches to these sites look like they originate from DDG's
  servers, so it protects the privacy of your search (at least the first
  pageload). Examples:



**edward snowden !g** - Google

**chelsea manning !w** - Wikipedia

**richard stallman !yt** - YouTube

**debian !gi** - Google Images

**glenn greenwald !n** - Google News

**free software foundation !gm** - Google Maps

**jingoism !d** - Free Dictionary

# Potential Problems

We've been recommending DuckDuckGo on this wiki for some time, and (as
of September 2013) it still seems to respect user privacy. **However**,
it is based in the United States and, as such, may be vulnerable to
surveillance programs/police searches/laws like PRISM, FISA, and
PATRIOT. Other search engines like
[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) and
[Ixquick](https://www.ixquick.com/) may also be vulnerable to (at least)
programs like PRISM, but they are not based in the U.S. (at least not
primarily). We invite you to decide for yourself and discuss this issue.

# Readings

- [DDG Privacy Policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy)
- [Alexander Hanff's post](http://www.alexanderhanff.com/duckduckgone)
  about problems with DDG.
- [Discussion in DuckDuckGo's
  forum](https://duck.co/topic/we-have-to-talk-about-ddgs-honesty),
  including actions DDG has taken to remedy some of the problems and
  Hanff's response.
- [PRISM Break](http://prism-break.org/)'s statement on these search
  engines: "Startpage is proprietary, hosted in the USA/Netherlands, and
  provides you with anonymized Google search results (including images).
  DuckDuckGo is partly proprietary, hosted in the USA, and provides you
  with anonymized Bing search results. Pick your poison." DuckDuckGo
  also has servers in the EU (see [forum
  discussion](https://duck.co/topic/we-have-to-talk-about-ddgs-honesty)).
- [PRISM fears spur DuckDuckGo's
  growth](http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/13/prism-fears-give-private-search-engine-duckduckgo-its-best-week-ever/),
  although some think it's [doesn't
  matter](http://searchengineland.com/duck-duck-go-prism-private-search-164333).

# Alternatives to DuckDuckGo

- [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)
- [Ixquick](https://www.ixquick.com/)

## Decentralized Solutions

- These can be be installed and run locally on your computer or Web
  server, but take a bit more work than popping a search term into your
  browser or phone app.
