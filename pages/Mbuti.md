The Mbuti hunter-gatherers in the Congo's Ituri Forest have
traditionally lived in stateless communities with gift economies and
largely egalitarian gender relations. The anthropologist Colin Turnbull,
after living with a Mbuti band, remarked, "They were a people who had
found in the forest something that made life more than just worth
living, something that made it, with all its hardships and problems and
tragedies, a wonderful thing full of joy and happiness and free of
care."[^1]

Today, several thousands Mbuti live in the forest but face threats from
the Congo's civil war and environmental devastation from coltan mining,
deforestation and hunting.[^2]

# Culture

Mbuti forgagers practice egalitarian gender relations, provide extensive
freedom for children, and have a non-authoritarian cosmovision.

## Gender Egalitarianism

Although men generally hunted, women sometimes took part in hunts. Men
would help with women's usual tasks of washing the children and
collecting mushrooms and nuts.[^3]

Rituals theatrically reinforce gender egalitarianism. One game begins
with women playing against men in a tug-of-war match. When one side
starts to win, someone from the winning team runs and joins the other
side. In the end, neither side wins and people have changed their gender
multiple times.[^4] In another ritual called the honey bee dance, men
try to steal honey from women who guard it with torches and hot coals.
After the women invariably succeed in protecting the honey, an elder
woman concludes the game by presenting a leaf of honey to the men. This
ritual reminds the community that although men provide most of the honey
(as well as meat), they can never turn it into a form of economic
control since the women control foods' distribution.[^5]

The men's *molimo* and women's *elima* rituals produce a
<a href="pendulum_of_power" class="wikilink"
title="pendulum of power">pendulum of power</a>, balancing against the
power of the other and ensuring overall egalitarianism.[^6]

Gelderloos writes that the Mbuti discouraged "excessive distinction
between genders. They did not use gendered pronouns or familial words —
e.g., instead of 'son' they say 'child,' 'sibling' instead of 'sister' —
except in the case of parents, in which there is a functional difference
between one who gives birth or provides milk and one who provides other
forms of care.[^7]

### Counterarguments

Clearly, Mbuti San society comes far closer to gender equality than the
vast majority of modern societies. However, it would be wrong to assume
that relations were totally equal. Turnbull's work includes several
descriptions of men beating women with communal approval. "\[A man named
Atete\] said that he was very content with his wife \[Akidinimba\], and
he had not found it necessary to beat her at all often."[^8] When Kenge
beat his sister Yambabo for refusing to marry, the following happened:
"People came sleepily out of their huts to watch, all rather agreeing
that Yambabo really should have married long ago and deserved brotherly
beating."[^9]

## Children

Childcare is highly cooperative. As soon as the mother first presents
her child to the camp, she hands the baby to close friends and family to
hold tight. From then on, the baby will be cared for and comforted not
just by the mother but by any women in the vicinity. [^10] Among the Efe
cluster, allomothers (women other than the biological mother) hold the
infant some 60% of the daytime. However, the biological mother is still
the one who holds the infant the most, and the infant sleeps next to the
mother.\<.ref\>Hrdy, *Mothers*, 78.

One popular game for young children involves six or more children
climbing a small tree until the tree bends enough to hit the ground.
Then they all jump off, and anyone who is too slow will get flung away
to general laughter.[^11]

At a young age, children begin living almost autonomously. Turnbull
describes the life of Mbuti children as "one long frolic interspersed
with a healthy sprinkle of spankings and slappings...And one day they
find that the games they have been playing are not games any longer, but
the real thing, for they have become adults. Their hunting is now real
hunting; their climbing is in earnest search of inaccessible honey;
their acrobatics on the swings are repeated almost daily, in other
forms, in the pursuit of elusive game, or in avoiding the malicious
forest buffalo. It happens so gradually that they hardly notice the
change at fist, for even when they are still proud and famous hunters
their life is still full of fun and laughter.[^12]

## Menstruation

When a girl menstruates for the first time, the community celebrates
with a ceremony called an *elima*.[^13] She goes with a group of friends
into a special house where they'll be visited and honored by people from
all over. For the Mbuti, this is "one of the happiest, most joyous
occasions in their lives."[^14]

Menstrual blood signifies life and is a cause of celebration. Although
there are some restrictions around it, the Mbuti say that a couple
wanting children should "sleep with the moon." [^15]

## Religion

Based on mutual obligations between humans and spirits, the Mbuti
cosmovision does not contain authoritarian "gods." Consequently,
Turnbull and Gelderloos each hesitate to call it a religion. Turnbull
writes, "They believe in a benevolent deity or supernatural power which
they identify with the forest. To this they owe as much respect and
affection and consideration as they owe to their own parents, and from
it they can expect the same in return."[^16] Gelderloos summarizes,
"\[T\]he Mbuti would traditionally use the noisy *molimo* ritual to wake
up the forest--seen as a spirit in its own right--if things were going
wrong."[^17]

The rainbow snake motif, common among the world's cultures, can be found
in Mbuti mythology. Mbutis envision the rainbow as a celestial snake
that possesses terrifying powers and sometimes devours humans.[^18]

The Mbuti "avoid speculating about whether there is a life after death."
The corpse is buried in a shallow grave or the person's hut collapsed is
collapsed over the body.[^19]

## Morality

The Mbuti believe that the forest is the giver of natural law. Turnbull
explains: "The forest, the great provider, is the one standard by which
all deeds and thoughts are judged; it is the chief, the lawgiver, the
leader, and the final arbitrator."[^20]

# Decisions

Adults of all genders make communal decisions at public assemblies. The
Mbuti do not have a state, or chiefs or councils. Turnbull explains, "If
you ask a Pygmy why his people have no chiefs, no lawmakers, no
councils, or no leaders, he will answer with misleading simplicity,
'Because we are the people of the forest.' The forest, the great
provider is the one standard by which all deeds and thoughts are judged;
it is the chief, the lawgiver, the leader, and the final
arbitrator."[^21] According to Gelderloos, ancient historians provided
accounts of the Mbuti living as stateless hunter-gatherers during the
reign of Egyptian pharohs, and the Mbuti themselves say they always
lived that way.[^22]

# Economy

As hunter-gatherers, the Mbuti maintain a cooperative and gift-based
economy. Turnbull writes, "Hunting, for a Pygmy group, is a co-operative
affair--net-hunting particularly."[^23] When a man caught and killed an
animal, his wife would bring it back to the camp to share with others.
When people felt that food was distributed unfairly, they would complain
and squabble until the distribution was corrected.[^24] The construction
of temporary villages was also a communal affair. The Mbuti lived in mud
huts about 7 feet by 5 feet.[^25]

Mashall Sahlins describes the Mbuti as an example of the "original
affluent society," easily satisfying all needs without living in
material abundance. Shalins quotes Turnbull, "The materials for the
making of shelter, clothing, and all other necessary items of material
culture are all at hand at a moment's notice."[^26]

# Environment

The Mbuti revere the forest and lived there sustainably for thousands of
years. The Mbuti villager Moke told Turnbull, "The forest is a father
and mother to us and like a father or mother it gives us everything we
need--food, clothing, shelter, warmth...and affection."[^27] However,
Turnbull describes some community members' cruel treatment of animals,
"I have seen the Pygmies sieging feathers off birds that were still
alive, explaining that the meat is more tender if the death comes
slowly. And the hunting dogs, valuable as they are, get kicked around
mercilessly from the day they are born to the day they die.[^28]

# Crime

Crime was rare. Turnbull writes that "among themselves theft is
virtually non-existent. For one thing, they have few possessions, and
for another there is no necessity for theft except through
laziness."[^29]

The Mbuti apply several diffuse sanctions for crime. For the less
serious crimes, the parties themselves solve the matter, by "either
arguing out the case, or engaging in a mild fight." For more serious
crimes, the village's young men would sound an instrument mimicking an
elephant and attack the criminal's hut. Villagers responded to very
serious crimes with ostracism and threats of supernatural
retribution.[^30] Turnbull describes an instance where a hunter named
Cephu put his hunting net before others', cheating the others out of
meat. The camp responded by taunting and ridiculing him, refusing to
give him a chair, and laughing at him. A few hours later, he apologized
and gave up the meat he had caught. Turnbull comments, "Cephu had
committed what is probably one of the most serious crimes in Pygmy eyes,
and one that rarely occurs. Yet the case was settled simply and
effectively, without any evident legal system being brought into force.
It cannot be said that Cephu went unpunished, because for those few
hours when nobody would speak to him he must have suffered the
equivalent of as many days solitary confinement for anyone else. To have
been refused a chair by a mere youth, not even one of the great hunters;
to have been laughed at by women and children; to have been ignored by
men--none of these things would be quickly forgotten. Without any formal
process of law Cephu had been firmly put in his place, and it was
unlikely he would do the same thing again in a hurry."[^31] In another
instance, a man committed incest with his cousin, a very serious crime
according to tradition. The youth chased him out of the village. After
three days, he returned and the village accepted him back.[^32]

# Neighboring Societies

From Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works [^33]:

> Contrary to common portrayals by outsiders, groups like the Mbuti are
> not isolated or primordial. In fact they have frequent interactions
> with the sedentary Bantu peoples surrounding the forest, and they have
> had plenty of opportunities to see what supposedly advanced societies
> are like. Going back at least hundreds of years, Mbuti have developed
> relationships of exchange and gift-giving with neighboring farmers,
> while retaining their identity as “the children of the forest.”
>
> Today several thousand Mbuti still live in the Ituri Forest and
> negotiate dynamic relationships with the changing world of the
> villagers, while fighting to preserve their traditional way of life.
> Many other Mbuti live in settlements along the new roads. Coltan
> mining for cell phones is a chief financial incentive for the civil
> war and the habitat destruction that is ravaging the region and
> killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. The governments of
> Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda all want to control this billion dollar
> industry, that produces primarily for the US and Europe, while miners
> seeking employment come from all over Africa to set up camp in the
> region. The deforestation, population boom, and increase in hunting to
> provide bush meat for the soldiers and miners have depleted local
> wildlife. Lacking food and competing for territorial control, soldiers
> and miners have taken to carrying out atrocities, including
> cannibalism, against the Mbuti. Some Mbuti are currently demanding an
> international tribunal against cannibalism and other violations.
