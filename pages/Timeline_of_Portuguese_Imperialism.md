title="Portuguese Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>.

## 1400s

- 1415: Portugal colonises Ceuta in
  <a href="Morocco" class="wikilink" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, but it
  was quickly recaptured.
- 1415:Henry the Navigator, a Portuguese Prince, explores coastal
  Africa. The Battle of Ceuta is fought, during which the Portuguese
  captured the city of Ceuta on the North coast of Africa from the
  Moors. Ceuta was the Portuguese empire’s first colony.
- 1420s-1440s:Portuguese explorers reach the archipelago of Madeira, the
  Azores, Cape Verde and Senegal.
- 1446:Portugal claims the region of Guinea, which would eventually
  become the centre of their slave trade in Africa.
- 1488:Bartolomeu Dias, under orders from the King of Portugal, is the
  first European navigator to successfully navigate around the Cape of
  Good Hope; an enormous step towards developing trading relations in
  the east.
- 1493:Pope Alexander VI divides the zones of exploration and conquest
  between the Portuguese and Spanish Empire by creating a north-south
  line just west of the Cape Verde Islands (Bulls of Donation).
  According to this model, Spain would be entitled to all of the New
  World (the Americas), while Portugal would be allotted Africa and
  almost all of Asia.
- 1494:The prior model for dividing the world between the Portuguese and
  Spanish empires was not accepted, and the Treaty of Tordesillas
  established a new demarcation line that was shifted further west,
  granting Portugal access to eastern Brazil.
- 1498:Vasco da Gama reaches Calicut on the southern coast of India.

## 1500s

- 1500:Pedro Cabral arrives in Brazil with a fleet of thirteen ships. In
  this same year, the Portuguese establish trading posts on the coast of
  Mozambique, at which time a number of small Islamic states were
  destroyed.
- 1502:Cabral launches a devastating war in Calicut, in an attempt to
  gain economic control and expel Muslims from the area. Much of the
  early and mid-sixteenth century Portuguese presence in India is
  characterized by wars, destruction, and massacres.
- 1505:The Portuguese establish a place in the lucrative cinnamon trade
  in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).
- 1510:The empire seizes Goa and makes it the capital of their empire in
  India. Goa would eventually become the empire’s headquarters in all of
  Asia in 1530.
- 1511-1534:The Portuguese drastically expand their presence in Asia and
  its trade network, taking control of Malacca (present-day Malaysia),
  establishing treaties for the trade of spices in the Moluccas (now
  Indonesia), and capturing Hormuz (now Iran) and Bombay (Mumbai).
- 1542:Missionaries from the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) arrive in Goa.
  Missionary presence from numerous orders is strong in Goa, and many
  Hindu and Muslim temples are destroyed in the sixteenth century.
  Catholic churches are built in this colony at an accelerated pace,
  with the goals of proselytizing large portions of Asia.
- 1549:Brazil is made a Portuguese royal province. This means that a
  central Portuguese government was established in the colony and the
  colony was overseen by a governor general (an appointed official from
  Portugal).
- 1557:A trading post is established at Macao, China.
- 1578:A battle ensues when the Portuguese lead a crusade into Morocco,
  and event known as the Battle of the Three Kings, during which King
  Sebastian of Portugal is killed. The crown is handed to Henry of
  Portugal who dies in 1580. Since he had no heirs to the throne, King
  Phillip II of Spain invaded the country and claimed the throne.
- 1580 -1640:The Portuguese crown is held by the Habsburg Kings of
  Spain.

## 1600s

- 1601-1661:The Dutch-Portuguese War is fought between Dutch forces –
  including the Dutch East and West Indies Companies – and the
  Portuguese empire. Portugal was victorious in taking all of Brazil
  from the Dutch, and in Africa they recaptured Angola. The Dutch were
  successful in taking-over trade in much of Asia, including the
  Moluccas, Malacca, Ceylon, parts of India, and Japan, where they were
  the only Europeans allowed to trade.
- 1622:After occupying Iranian territory for about a decade, Portuguese
  efforts to colonize Iran were defeated when Shah Abbas I of Persia –
  with help from the British East India Company – battled the Portuguese
  for the territory.
- 1640:John IV is made King of Portugal and the Restoration War begins
  in efforts to regain Portuguese autonomy from Spain.
- 1661:Bombay and Tangier are given to the British Empire. The
  Portuguese lose almost all control in India, save for Goa, Daman, and
  Diu.
- 1668:Spain recognizes Iberian autonomy and is ceded Ceuta for doing
  so.
- 1693:Gold deposits are discovered in Minas Gerais, Brazil. In addition
  to sugar and coffee, gold begins to make the Portuguese empire
  extremely wealthy. Eventually, diamonds are also discovered in areas
  of Brazil under Portuguese rule. Portugal imports hundreds of
  thousands of West African slaves to work in the mines and in
  agricultural areas in the northeast—ten times as many as in the United
  States.

## 1700s

- 1755:A catastrophic earthquake hits Lisbon, and together with the
  Tsunami that followed, more than one third of the population is
  killed. This constituted a serious blow to Portuguese colonial efforts
  in the eighteenth century, as both people and resources were running
  thin.
- 1763:Despite weakened presence in Asia, the Portuguese hold on Brazil
  is strong, and the capital of the Portuguese empire in Brazil is moved
  from Bahia (Salvador) to Rio de Janeiro. The slave-trade from Africa
  under Portuguese control continues to rise.
- 1788:A rebellion against Portuguese rule in Brazil occurs in Minas
  Gerais as part of a Brazilian Revolutionary Movement known as the
  Inconfidência Mineira inspired by the French Enlightenment. The
  rebellion fails miserably, and the leaders are caught and severely
  punished.

## 1800s

- 1815:Due to Napoleon’s invasion of Portugal in 1808, Brazil was
  elevated to the status of a Kingdom and the Portuguese capital was
  moved from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. This is the only time a country
  was ruled from one of its colonies and the only time a European royal
  family moved to the Americas.
- 1822:Dom (King) Pedro declares Brazilian Independence. In comparison
  with Spanish colonies in South America, the Brazilian Independence
  movement was less violent. Dom Pedro is crowned Emperor of Brazil.
  With no control or colonies in Brazil, and very few colonies left in
  Asia, Portugal shifts their focus to their African colonies.
- 1875:Slavery is made illegal in the Portuguese empire.
- 1888:Slavery abolished in Brazil along with the Brazilian Empire.

## 1900s

- 1961:During the decolonization efforts after the Second World War, Goa
  is the first colony to gain independence from Portugal.
- 1950s-1970s:A number of Independence Movements break out in Portuguese
  colonies in Africa. With the Cardinal Revolution of 1974 – in which
  António de Oliveira Salazar’s authoritarian Regime ended – Portugal
  removes its presence from many African countries, as well as from East
  Timor.
- 1999:Macau is handed over to the People’s Republic of China,
  effectively ending the Portuguese overseas empire.
