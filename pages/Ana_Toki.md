Ana Toki is a constructed language that is completely based on the
anarchist ideology. It embodies the principles of anarchism, aiming to
promote ideas of decentralization, self-governance, and
anti-authoritarianism. It is designed to be straightforward and
accessible, reflecting values of simplicity and inclusivity.

Ana Toki is a language with a vocabulary of only about 150 words. This
makes it easy to learn, even for people who are not familiar with other
languages. The grammar is also very straightforward, and there are no
exceptions to the rules.

Another important aspect of Ana Toki is its use of words reflecting the
anarchist ideology. For example, the word for "government" is "ewon"
which means "prison." This shows that anarchists believe that government
is a form of oppression
