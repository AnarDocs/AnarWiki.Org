Biologist Lewis Thomas describes a symbiotic relationship between the
mimosa tree and the *oncideres* beetle in his essay "Seven Wonders." By
pruning branches for her eggs to survive in, the beetle quadruples the
lifespan of the tree.

> "My Number Three Wonder is oncideres, a species of beetle encountered
> by a pathologist friend of mine who lives in Houston and has a lot of
> mimosa trees in his backyard. This beetle is not new, but it qualifies
> as a Modern Wonder because of the exceedingly modern questions raised
> for evolutionary biologists about the three consecutive things on the
> mind of the female of the species. Her first thought is for a mimosa
> tree, which she finds and climbs, ignoring all other kinds of trees in
> the vicinity. Her second thought is for the laying of eggs, which she
> does by crawling out on a limb, cutting a longitudinal slit with her
> mandible and depositing her eggs beneath the slit. Her third and last
> thought concerns the welfare of her offspring; beetle larvae cannot
> survive in live wood, so she backs up a foot or so and cuts a neat
> circular girdle all around the limb, through the bark and down into
> the cambium. It takes her eight hours to finish this cabinetwork. Then
> she leaves and where she goes I do not know. The limb dies from the
> girdling, falls to the ground in the next breeze, the larvae feed and
> grow into the next generation, and the questions lie there unanswered.
> How on earth did these three linked thoughts in her mind evolve
> together in evolution? How could any one of the three become fixed as
> beetle behavior by itself, without the other two? What are the odds
> favoring three totally separate bits of behavior—liking a particular
> tree, cutting a slit for eggs, and then girdling the limb—happening
> together by random chance among a beetle's genes? Does this smart
> beetle know what she is doing? And how did the mimosa tree enter the
> picture in its evolution? Left to themselves, unpruned, mimosa trees
> have a life expectancy of twentyfive to thirty years. Pruned each
> year, which is what the beetle's girdling labor accomplishes, the tree
> can flourish for a century. The mimosa-beetle relationship is an
> elegant example of symbiotic partnership, a phenomenon now recognized
> as pervasive in nature. It is good for us to have around on our
> intellectual mantelpiece such creatures as this insect and its friend
> the tree, for they keep reminding us how little we know about
> nature."[^1]
