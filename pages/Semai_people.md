The Semai people live in what's now the Malay Peninsula. In 2007, the
Semai had 43,500 members.[^1]

## History

The Semai are thought to be descendants of the original population of
Southeast Asia, arriving on the Malay Peninsula around 8000-6000 BC.[^2]
The Malays arrived approximately 1000 years after the Semai, initially
trading peacefully with them. However, when the Malays created kingdoms
and converted to Islam, this relationship fundamentally changed. The
Malays began considering the Semai as "despised pagans" and sanctioned
murdering Semai adults and kidnapping young children.[^3] Several
Malaysian state governments continue to operate religious agencies with
programs specifically designed to convert the Semai to Islam.[^4]

It has been suggested that the Semai's emphasis on non-violence
developed as a strategic response to these historic threats from slaving
states. As the Semai were constantly defeated by slavers and Malaysian
state authorities, they preferred to flee rather than fight, and this
evolved into a general cultural norm of non-violence.[^5]

## Organisation

### Stateless Society

The Semai have no police and no government. According to anthropologist
Robert Dentan, adults appear to be controlled primarily by public
opinion. The Semai themselves say "There is no authority here but
embarrassment." Although popular and verbally skilled individuals may be
influential in public affairs, the Semai have no formal leaders.[^6]

### Settlement Patterns

The Semai live in settlements of 30 to 200 people. Individual households
consist of nuclear families with sometimes a few extended relatives.
Most dwellings are built with wood and bamboo with woven walls and
thatched roofs using palm leaves. Semai houses have no visible bedrooms,
especially for children, as they all sleep in the main hall. The only
separation for parents' chambers uses wooden-beaded curtains.[^7]

There are no locks or devices to prevent unwanted entry. A simple way of
indicating that entry is unwanted is by drawing down the curtains. To
allow entry, the curtain is drawn to the sides. Expressed permission
must be requested when the curtains are closed. With regards to space
and dominion, there appears to be no distinction between the public and
private realms, and thus, "the Western concept of privacy, domestic or
otherwise, is not to be found".[^8]

### Marriage and Autonomy

The vast majority of Semai marriages are monogamous. Semai marriages are
exogamous - they do not marry blood relations. In most marriages,
couples are from different settlements. This leads to an ambilocal
residence pattern after marriage, where couples shuttle between living
with the wife or husband's kinsman every few weeks, slowly lengthening
the time periods until the couple decides to settle down. One reason the
Semai give for shuttling is homesickness. Even after settling down,
couples occasionally separate for week- or month-long visits to their
blood relatives. This pattern may explain why divorce and remarriage are
fairly common, as couples maintain autonomy and connections to their
original communities.[^9]

## Punan

A central concept in Semai society is *punan*. Punan is the belief that
making somebody else unhappy, especially by imposing your own wishes or
denying their desires, is taboo. The Semai believe that committing punan
increases the likelihood of being injured physically. The importance of
punan shapes food sharing norms, leadership style, and child-rearing
practices.[^10]

It is considered punan to refuse a request for food or to ask for more
than someone can give. It is punan to force a child to do something
against their will. This belief system fundamentally undermines
hierarchical authority and coercion, as the community itself enforces
norms against domination through the threat of supernatural
consequences.

## Childhood

Semai children are never punished or forced against their will.[^11] If
a parent asks a child to do something and the child says "I don't want
to," the matter is ended. Parents may threaten to hit children and raise
a fist or machete, but they do not actually carry out the threat, with
the worst being a tap. The concept of *mengalah* or giving in is
cherished, where children are taught from young to 'give way' to others
to preserve peace and harmony.[^12]

The games Semai children play are non-competitive. These games include
forms of sports that encourage physical activity but without winners or
losers. One game involves hitting at other children with sticks, but the
sticks always stop short a few inches from their target so no one gets
struck. A game of badminton uses no partition nets and keeps no score.
The shuttlecock is deliberately hit so it can be easily intercepted and
passed back. The objective is purely exercise. When the Semai have
imported competitive games from other cultures, they modify them so that
when conflict arises, it is quickly solved by deference to the older
player, who is always considered right.[^13]

## Worldview

The Semai worldview is that they live in a hostile and dangerous world
beyond their control. The jungles surrounding their villages are viewed
as full of terrifying forces and malevolent entities, to the extent that
the Semai are reluctant to go into jungles alone, especially at night.
Since the Semai see themselves as helpless in a hostile world, the only
source of safety and nurturance lies with their community. This is the
foundation of Semai emphasis on community harmony and non-violence, as
violence threatens to destroy their only perceived source of
safety.[^14]

## Nuance on Violence

While the Semai are known for extremely low levels of violence, this
does not mean they are incapable of violence. During the Malayan
Emergency in the 1950s, the British recruited some Semai to fight
against communist insurgents. Dentan argues the Semai believe that as
Malaysia industrializes, it will be harder for them to use their
strategy of fleeing and they may have to fight instead.[^15] The Semai's
non-violence appears to be a conscious cultural choice and survival
strategy rather than an inherent incapacity for violence, demonstrating
that peaceful societies can be maintained through cultural practices and
social norms rather than coercive authority.

## Culture

*Peaceful Societies* describes the Semai beliefs fostering peace:

> The Semai have a strongly nonviolent image of themselves; they
> proclaim themselves to be nonviolent people who do not get angry or
> hit others. In fact, they do quarrel and get angry at times, but
> aggressive expressions of anger are rare, and they almost never hit
> their children. They see themselves as non-aggressive, dependent and
> nurturant. A self-image that allowed aggression would contradict their
> definition of virtue. Their worldview, and humanity's place in it,
> does not include any violence. They see themselves as helplessly
> surrounded by hostile forces, both natural and supernatural, and they
> proceed with caution in all their daily activities in the face of
> ubiquitous dangers. Security comes only from the sharing, peace and
> integration of their villages.

*Peaceful Societies* elaborates on other aspects of Semai culture
including gender relations and childcare:

> **Gender Relations.** The social structure of the Semai includes a
> clear but not rigid division of labor between the sexes: there are no
> separate ideals for women versus men, and no tasks that are strictly
> for women or men. The newly married Semai couple often lives for weeks
> in the wife's settlement (usually spouses are from different
> settlements); then they live in his, then hers, and so on, the visits
> lengthening until they finally settle down in one or the other. The
> people in the East Semai region—who have less contact with the Malay
> peoples—have no formal marriage ceremonies. When a couple starts
> living together, they are considered husband and wife; if they no
> longer sleep and eat together, they are considered separated.
>
> **Raising Children.** Infants are cared for and loved constantly but
> they face a rude awakening when they are about two and their mothers
> decide they have other work to do and cannot continue providing
> constant nurturing. From two until about four, the child discovers
> that crying and violent temper tantrums bring no response from the
> parents or anyone else in the village. Children thus lose their
> feelings of dependency on the parents alone, and begin to seek support
> from the whole community. Children do not see aggression by adults,
> and when they fight among themselves a parent will normally take the
> angry child away from its game and back to the house, reinforcing
> their taboo against violence and anger. Children do not play
> competitive games.
>
> **Social Practices.** For the Semai, the ideal adult man has a good
> relationship with his wife, loves his children more than anything, has
> a normal sexual appetite, a good appetite, and a healthy, cool body.
> He keeps his feelings and thoughts within. He does not cause
> difficulties for others and does not try to make someone, even his own
> child, do something contrary to that person's will. He does not harm
> strangers, even though he mistrusts them, and if attacked he will open
> his arms hoping to shame the attacker out of his aggressiveness, or he
> will flee.
>
> **Sense of Self.** The Semai learn during childhood to fear emotional
> arousal of any kind, especially anger, which they see as highly
> threatening. They vastly exaggerate the consequences of corporal
> punishment of children, which might result from anger: if a child were
> spanked, he or she might die. They are quite restrained in their
> mourning, their anger, even their laughter; their interpersonal
> relationships are reserved. The only emotion they express openly,
> without reservation, is fear—of strangers and especially of violent
> thunderstorms. An onrushing thunderstorm arouses massive, and to a
> westerner highly irrational, fear.

## Economy

The Semai have traditionally had a gift economy based in horticulture.
They cultivated cassava and rice, hunted and fished. Sharing was
paramount, as *Peaceful Societies* explains:

> The Semai have two primary moral values: avoiding violence and sharing
> food. Semai women share the manioc that they harvest immediately after
> they return to the village from their fields. Likewise, Semai men
> share the fruits of their hunting, fishing, or gathering. These
> patterns are all quite sensible since they have no way to preserve
> foods, though food sharing frequently has little practical value, as
> one person will share a portion of a harvest or gathering expedition,
> only to have the recipients share portions of their foods shortly
> thereafter. But these sharing experiences are important for their
> symbolic, public statements of mutual dependence, nurturance, and the
> close ties of the band. No one seems to calculate the extent of their
> giving or receiving.

Peter Gelderloos elaborates:

> The traditional society of the Semai, in Malaya, is based on
> gift-giving rather than bartering. We could not find any accounts of
> their society recorded by the Semai themselves, but they explained how
> it worked to Robert Dentan, a Western anthropologist who lived with
> them for a time. Dentan writes that the “system by which the Semai
> distribute food and services is one of the most significant ways in
> which members of a community are knit together... Semai economic
> exchanges are more like Christmas exchanges than like commercial
> exchanges.”[^16] It was considered “punan,” or taboo, for members of
> Semai society to calculate the value of gifts given or received. Other
> commonly held rules of etiquette included the duty to share whatever
> they had that they did not immediately need, and the duty to share
> with guests and anyone who asked. It was punan not to share or to
> refuse a request, but also to ask for more than someone could
> give.[^17]

## Crime

*Peaceful Societies* describes Semai methods of peaceful conflict
resolution:

> Before they moved into permanent villages, the Semai preferred to
> resolve serious disputes informally, through such strategies as
> separation, gossip, or shaming, particularly of individuals that the
> community believed were responsible for causing problems. The Semai
> still frequently practice such informal conflict resolution
> strategies, but they have also adopted, and modified for their own
> purposes, the use of more formal meetings as practiced by the
> surrounding, dominant, Malay peoples. The purpose, for the Semai, of
> having such a formal meeting, called a bcaraa', is to settle the
> dispute rather than to determine guilt or innocence. After a lot of
> socializing, a headman will give a long lecture on the importance of
> group solidarity, mutual dependence, and peace. Then the principals to
> the dispute will present their viewpoints in speeches that may
> continue for many hours, until no one has anything additional to say
> and everyone is exhausted. The headman then concludes the bcaraa',
> perhaps by levying small fines if appropriate, and he continues by
> lecturing everyone on correct, peaceful Semai behavior. The meeting
> resolves the dispute itself, reconciles the parties, dissipates their
> emotions, reintegrates the whole village, reaffirms everyone’s
> interdependence, and re-confirms the importance of nonviolent
> behavior.

Gelderloos adds:

> Their murder rate is only 0.56/100,000 per year, compared with 0.86 in
> Norway, 6.26 in the US, and 20.20 in Russia.\[11\] This may be related
> to their childrearing strategy: traditionally the Semai do not hit
> their children, and respect for their children’s autonomy is a
> normalized value in their society. One of the few occasions in which
> Semai adults will typically intervene is when children lose their
> tempers or fight one another, in which case nearby adults will snatch
> up the children and take them to their respective houses. The major
> forces that uphold Semai peacefulness seem to be an emphasis on
> learning self-control and the great importance accorded to public
> opinion in a cooperative society.
>
> According to Robert Dentan, a Western anthropologist who lived with
> them, “little violence occurs within Semai society. Violence, in fact,
> seems to terrify the Semai. A Semai does not meet force with force,
> but with passivity or flight. Yet, he has no institutionalized way of
> preventing violence — no social controls, no police or courts. Somehow
> a Semai learns automatically always to keep tight rein over his
> aggressive impulses.”\[12\] The first time the Semai participated in a
> war was when the British conscripted them to fight against the
> Communist insurgency in the early 1950s. Clearly, warfare is not an
> inevitability and certainly not a human need: rather, it is a
> consequence of political, social, and economic arrangements, and these
> arrangements are ours to shape.'
