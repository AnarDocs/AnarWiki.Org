# Horseshoe Theory

**Horseshoe theory** is a political concept asserting that the far-left
and far-right, rather than being at opposite ends of a linear political
spectrum, closely resemble each other in practice and methodology. The
theory takes its name from the shape of a horseshoe, where the two ends
curve toward each other while remaining distinct at their bases.

## Origins and Development

The theory is attributed to French philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye in his
1972 book *Théorie du récit: introduction aux langages totalitaires*,
though the metaphor was used during the Weimar Republic to describe the
ideology of the Black Front.[^1] Faye used the horseshoe metaphor to
describe the political positions of German parties from the Communist
Party to the Nazi Party in 1932.

The theory gained renewed attention in popular discourse, particularly
among centrist and liberal commentators, as a way to critique both
far-left and far-right movements. It has been promoted by figures
associated with neoconservatism and Cold War liberalism, including
American sociologists Seymour Martin Lipset and Daniel Bell.

## Anarchist Critique

From an anarchist perspective, the horseshoe theory contains both
fundamental flaws and a kernel of useful observation, though not in the
way its centrist proponents intend.

### The Original Left-Right Spectrum

The original left-right political spectrum, established during the
French Revolution, was fundamentally about authority versus liberty. In
the French National Assembly, representatives were seated from left to
right based on their support for or opposition to hierarchical power.
The furthest left seats were occupied by those most opposed to
concentrated authority, including early anarchist thinkers like
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, while the furthest right contained monarchists
and defenders of hierarchical social order.

This historical reality directly contradicts the horseshoe theory's
premise. The original spectrum was not a measure of economic policy or
cultural values but of attitudes toward authority and hierarchy. Moving
leftward meant moving toward greater liberty and opposition to
concentrated power; moving rightward meant support for authority,
tradition, and social hierarchy.

### Authoritarian Convergence

However, anarchists recognize that authoritarian ideologies do tend to
converge in practice, regardless of their theoretical foundations or
stated goals. This is where a modified understanding of the horseshoe
concept has limited utility.

Stalinism and fascism, while ideologically distinct in their
justifications, employed remarkably similar authoritarian methods:
secret police, concentration camps, suppression of dissent, personality
cults, totalitarian control of information, and the subordination of
individuals to state power. From an anarchist perspective, these
similarities are not coincidental but inherent to all systems built on
hierarchical authority and state power.

Many anarchists therefore argue that authoritarian "leftist" movements
like Leninism, Stalinism, and Maoism should properly be considered
right-wing, as they perpetuate and expand hierarchical power structures
regardless of their revolutionary rhetoric. The concentration of power
in a vanguard party or state apparatus represents a fundamental betrayal
of leftist principles as originally conceived.

### The False Center

The horseshoe theory is particularly problematic in its implicit
elevation of "the center" as a position of reasoned moderation. From an
anarchist perspective, this centrist position merely represents support
for the status quo of existing hierarchies—capitalism, the state, and
other forms of institutionalized domination. The theory serves an
ideological function by delegitimizing radical challenges to existing
power structures from any direction.

Centrist liberals have historically aligned with far-right movements
when faced with socialist or anarchist alternatives. Examples include
support for fascist regimes in Spain, Chile, and Brazil, where liberal
forces preferred authoritarian right-wing governments to socialist or
anarchist alternatives that threatened capitalist property relations.
The horseshoe theory allows centrists to equate these threats while
obscuring their own complicity in empowering the far right.

### Fundamental Differences

Despite superficial similarities in opposing liberal democracy, the
far-left and far-right have fundamentally opposed goals and analyses.
Fascism seeks to restore or create hierarchies based on nation, race,
and tradition. Genuine left-wing movements (as distinct from
authoritarian state socialism) seek to abolish hierarchy entirely.

When both critique "elites," they mean different things. The right
typically targets cultural or ethnic minorities, immigrants, or
international institutions while defending capitalist property relations
and traditional authority. The left targets concentrations of economic
and political power, landlords, bosses, and state officials.

Academic research has consistently failed to support the horseshoe
theory's central premise, finding that far-left and far-right movements
attract different people, hold different values, and pursue incompatible
objectives.[^2]

### Authority vs. Liberty

The proper axis for understanding political positions from an anarchist
perspective is not left versus right in economic terms, but authority
versus liberty. On this spectrum:

- **Authoritarian right**: Fascism, absolute monarchy, theocracy
- **Authoritarian "left"**: Stalinism, Maoism, authoritarian state
  socialism
- **Libertarian right**: Right-libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism
  (though anarchists dispute whether this truly opposes hierarchy)
- **Libertarian left**: Anarchism in its various forms
  (anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, mutualism)

The convergence that the horseshoe theory identifies is not between the
far ends of a left-right spectrum, but between different varieties of
authoritarianism. The true opposition is not between left and right, but
between freedom and domination, between horizontal and hierarchical
organization.
