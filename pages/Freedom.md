# Freedom

## Overview

Freedom is the central value and organizing principle of
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>.
Unlike liberal conceptions which treat freedom as mere absence of
interference, or authoritarian conceptions which subordinate freedom to
collective goals, anarchism understands freedom as a positive social
condition requiring both the absence of domination and the presence of
enabling material and social conditions.

As Bakunin articulated, "I am truly free only when all human beings, men
and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating
or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and
confirmation."[^1] This principle establishes that freedom is not a
zero-sum game where one person's liberty diminishes another's, but
rather an interconnected phenomenon where genuine freedom can only exist
collectively.

The anarchist conception of freedom rejects both the liberal reduction
of freedom to
<a href="property" class="wikilink" title="property">property</a> rights
and market relations, and the authoritarian sacrifice of individual
autonomy to state power. Instead, anarchism recognizes that true freedom
requires: the abolition of hierarchical domination, material security
and access to resources, collective self-determination through
horizontal organization, and the cultivation of social solidarity across
differences.[^2]

## Origins

The anarchist theory of freedom emerged in the mid-19th century through
critical engagement with three major intellectual traditions:
<a href="liberalism" class="wikilink" title="liberalism">liberalism</a>,
<a href="republicanism" class="wikilink"
title="republicanism">republicanism</a>, and
<a href="socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialism">socialism</a>.
Each contributed essential insights while containing fatal limitations
that anarchism sought to overcome.

### Liberal Roots and Critique

The liberal tradition, from Hobbes through Adam Smith, conceived freedom
primarily as self-ownership and non-interference.
<a href="William_Godwin" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">William
Godwin</a>'s utilitarian anarchism built upon this foundation while
rejecting its accommodation with
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and the <a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>. Godwin
argued that true freedom required not just absence of direct coercion
but independence from all forms of domination, including economic
dependency.[^3]

However, liberal freedom contained a fundamental contradiction. By
treating individuals as self-sufficient atoms who voluntarily contract
into society, liberalism justified the alienation of one's freedom to
employers and states. As Bakunin observed, liberals claimed to oppose
authority while accepting that "the masses are too ignorant to enjoy
this anarchy without abusing it," thus requiring the discipline of the
state to maintain bourgeois order.[^4]

The liberal conception particularly failed regarding
<a href="private_property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a>. What liberals called
"freedom" in economic relations was actually the freedom of property
owners to dominate the propertyless. As
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> demonstrated,
the system of bourgeois property transformed slavery into
<a href="wage_slavery" class="wikilink" title="wage slavery">wage
slavery</a>, replacing direct ownership of persons with indirect control
through monopolization of the means of life.

### Republican and Socialist Influences

Republican theory, particularly through
<a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, emphasized that
freedom required equality and popular sovereignty. Rousseau recognized
that humans "are born free, but everywhere are in chains"—not due to
natural necessity but because of unjust social institutions.[^5] His
insight that genuine freedom required participation in lawmaking
influenced anarchist federalism, even as anarchists rejected his
state-centric solutions.

Socialist theory contributed the recognition that freedom required
material conditions. The emerging working-class movement demonstrated
that abstract political rights meant nothing to those compelled to sell
their labor to survive. However, authoritarian socialism subordinated
individual freedom to collective goals, treating freedom as something to
be deferred until after revolutionary transformation rather than
practiced in the present.

### Anarchist Synthesis

Anarchism synthesized these traditions while transcending their
limitations. From Proudhon onward, anarchists argued that:

Freedom requires both individual autonomy and social solidarity—the
"communitarian individualism" that rejects both atomistic liberalism and
authoritarian collectivism.

Freedom is inseparable from equality—not equality of submission but
"equality in freedom," where each person's autonomy is the condition for
all others'.[^6]

Freedom demands material foundations—access to resources, security of
subsistence, and collective control over production.

Freedom must be prefigurative—practiced in the means of struggle, not
promised as a future reward.

This synthesis emerged most clearly in Bakunin's materialist conception
of freedom, which rejected both idealist notions of abstract liberty and
determinist denials of human agency. As Bakunin argued, humans achieve
freedom not as isolated individuals but through social development, yet
this social determination does not negate but rather enables genuine
choice and self-creation.

## The Nature of Anarchist Freedom

### Freedom as Non-Domination

At its foundation, anarchist freedom means absence of domination.
**Domination** encompasses all systematic relations through which some
control, coerce, exploit, or humiliate others.[^7] This includes but is
not limited to:

- <a href="State" class="wikilink" title="State">State</a> power and
  legal authority
- <a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="Capitalist">Capitalist</a>
  economic relations
- <a href="Patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="Patriarchy">Patriarchy</a>
  and gender hierarchy
- <a href="Racism" class="wikilink" title="Racism">Racism</a> and
  colonial oppression
- All forms of social ranking and subordination

Crucially, anarchism recognizes that domination operates through both
centralized institutions like states and decentralized social relations
like patriarchal family structures. The problem is not merely
concentration of power but hierarchical power relations as such. Two
people can "chain each other down" through mutually oppressive dynamics
even without clear hierarchy.[^8]

This expansive understanding distinguishes anarchist freedom from
liberal "negative liberty." It is not enough to lack direct
interference—one must be free from the standing threat of domination,
from structures that constrain choices, and from social relations that
reduce persons to subordinate status. A person subject to an employer's
arbitrary authority is unfree even when not currently being ordered
about, just as a wife under patriarchal marriage is unfree regardless of
how her husband currently treats her.

### Freedom as Capability and Empowerment

Anarchist freedom requires positive conditions beyond mere absence of
constraint. As Bakunin emphasized, freedom means "the full development
of all material, intellectual and moral activities that are latent in
each and every one of us."[^9] This positive dimension includes:

**Material Security**: Freedom from hunger, homelessness, and
deprivation. One cannot be free while struggling for survival or
dependent on others' arbitrary will for basic needs.

**Access to Resources**: The ability to use tools, land, knowledge, and
other resources necessary for self-development.
<a href="Commons" class="wikilink"
title="Collective stewardship">Collective stewardship</a> of resources
enables this access without creating relations of domination.

**Education and Development**: Opportunities for learning,
skill-building, and self-cultivation. Education must be liberatory
rather than disciplinary, fostering critical thought rather than
obedience.

**Social Support**: Networks of
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and solidarity that enable people to take risks, experiment, and develop
their capacities without fear of destitution.

This positive conception counters the liberal notion that freedom
consists merely in being "left alone." True freedom requires not
isolation but connection, not privation but abundance, not independence
but interdependence freely chosen. The materialist recognition that
humans are social beings whose individuality emerges through collective
life means freedom can only be achieved socially, never in atomistic
isolation.

### Freedom Through Freedom

The most distinctive anarchist insight is that freedom is interconnected
and mutually reinforcing rather than zero-sum. As Bakunin expressed it:
"the freedom of others is far from being a limit to or a denial of mine,
on the contrary it is a necessary condition which confirms it."[^10]

This "freedom through freedom" principle operates on multiple levels:

**Individual-Collective**: Each person's autonomy depends on others
being equally autonomous. A society of masters and slaves enslaves
both—the master to the role of master, the slave to the master's will.

**Material-Social**: Access to resources enables participation in social
life, while participation enables collective control over resources.
Economic and political freedom are inseparable.

**Negative-Positive**: Freedom from domination and freedom for
self-development reinforce each other. Removing constraints opens
possibilities, while enabling capabilities reduces vulnerability to
control.

As William Gillis argues, this is not mere sentiment but reflects the
actual structure of freedom: "To fire a gun at your neighbor's head
would gravely deprive the world of possibility. True freedom is not
predicated on the imprisonment of others but rather their
liberation."[^11] Freedom is not about maximizing isolated individual
power but about expanding collective possibility. Every person freed
expands what is achievable for all.

## Requirements for Freedom

### Abolition of Hierarchy

Freedom requires the complete abolition of hierarchical domination in
all its forms. This means not merely limiting authority or making it
accountable, but eliminating relations of command and obedience
altogether. As Bakunin argued, the problem with
<a href="the_State" class="wikilink" title="the State">the State</a> is
not particular policies but its very nature as monopoly of coercive
power. Every law, however well-intentioned, is imposed by force and thus
"slaps liberty in the face."[^12]

The anarchist critique extends beyond formal political authority to all
hierarchical structures:

**Economic Hierarchy**: Capitalism creates domination through property
ownership and wage relations. Employers exercise arbitrary power over
workers' time, activity, and livelihood. This system must be replaced
with <a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>, where
those who produce collectively control production.

**Social Hierarchy**: Patriarchal family structures, racist caste
systems, and other informal hierarchies operate through social pressure
and cultural norms rather than formal law. These require cultural
transformation alongside institutional change.

**Intellectual Hierarchy**: Systems that divide people into those
qualified to think and those meant to obey—expert rule, academic
gatekeeping, media control—must give way to collective intelligence and
free exchange of knowledge.

Crucially, decentralization alone does not ensure freedom. Decentralized
oppression can be as severe as centralized domination. The goal is not
dispersion of authority but its abolition, replaced by cooperative
coordination among equals.

### Economic Foundations

Genuine freedom requires material security and collective control over
resources. Three principles govern anarchist economic freedom:

**Unconditional Access to Necessities**: No one should face deprivation
for non-compliance with any authority or system. Food, shelter,
healthcare, and other basic needs must be freely available to all. This
prevents economic coercion and ensures that participation in social
institutions is voluntary rather than compelled by survival necessity.

**Commons Management**: Resources should be held in common and managed
collectively rather than privately owned. This applies to land, tools,
knowledge, and all means of production. Commons-based stewardship
ensures universal access while maintaining sustainability through
collective care.

**From Each According to Ability, To Each According to Need**:
Production should be organized through voluntary cooperation based on
capacity and desire to contribute, while distribution should prioritize
meeting needs rather than rewarding compliance or measuring individual
contribution. This principle recognizes both human interdependence and
individual variation.

Economic freedom thus means neither the liberal "freedom" to exploit
through property rights nor the authoritarian rationing of survival. It
means collective abundance through cooperative labor and mutual aid,
ensuring material security as the foundation for all other freedoms.

### Institutional Forms

Freedom requires specific organizational structures that enable
collective self-determination without creating new hierarchies.
Historical anarchist practice has developed several key institutional
forms:

**Direct Democracy**: Decisions affecting a group should be made by all
members through face-to-face deliberation. This ensures genuine
participation while preventing the emergence of representative elites
who claim to speak for others.
<a href="Consensus" class="wikilink" title="Consensus">Consensus</a>
processes are often preferred to majority rule, as they require
addressing everyone's concerns rather than overriding minorities.

**Federation**: Coordination across groups and regions through
federative structure, where delegates carry specific mandates from base
assemblies and can be immediately recalled. Federations coordinate
activity without creating central authority, as all power remains in
local assemblies.[^13]

**Mutual Aid Networks**: Voluntary associations for meeting needs and
pursuing common goals. These range from
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink"
title="informal support networks">informal support networks</a> to
structured organizations like
<a href="workers&#39;_councils" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a> and
<a href="syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="revolutionary unions">revolutionary unions</a>. Their voluntary
character prevents coercion while their collective strength enables
effective action.

**Commons Institutions**: Structures for managing shared resources, from
community land trusts to tool libraries to cooperative workshops. These
embody collective stewardship while ensuring individual access.

These institutions must be prefigurative, embodying in their structure
and practice the freedom they aim to achieve. As the saying goes, "you
cannot achieve a free society through authoritarian means."

### Cultural Transformation

Freedom requires not just institutional change but transformation of
social consciousness and interpersonal relations. Several cultural
shifts are essential:

**From Domination to Solidarity**: Replacing competitive, hierarchical
relations with cooperative, egalitarian ones. This means cultivating
empathy, mutual respect, and recognition of interdependence.

**From Obedience to Autonomy**: Rejecting the habit of deference to
authority in favor of independent critical thought and collective
deliberation. Education and social life must nurture the capacity for
self-direction rather than training in submission.

**From Scarcity to Abundance Consciousness**: Overcoming the psychology
of artificial scarcity that justifies hoarding and competition.
Recognizing that collective cooperation creates more possibilities than
individual accumulation.

**From Identity to Diversity**: Moving beyond fixed, enforced categories
toward recognition and celebration of human variation. This requires
rejecting both forced uniformity and hierarchies of difference.

Such cultural transformation cannot be imposed but emerges through lived
experience of libertarian relations. As Bakunin noted, people raised in
slavery naturally exhibit slavish traits, while those experiencing
genuine freedom develop autonomous character. Building free institutions
thus creates the culture of freedom.

## Obtaining Freedom

### Revolutionary Transformation

Anarchist freedom cannot be achieved through reform of existing
institutions but requires revolutionary transformation that abolishes
hierarchical power. As Kropotkin insisted, "Freedom is not given—it is
taken."[^14] This principle captures the anarchist understanding that no
authority ever voluntarily grants liberation; freedom must be seized
through collective action. However, anarchist revolution differs
fundamentally from authoritarian models:

**No Revolutionary State**: Unlike Marxist-Leninism, anarchism rejects
the idea of seizing state power or establishing revolutionary
dictatorship. As Bakunin argued against Marx, no temporary authority
ever voluntarily dissolves, and governing from above reproduces
domination even if pursued with revolutionary intentions. Freedom must
be achieved through freedom, not through new forms of authority
promising future liberation.

**Direct Action**: Rather than appealing to authorities or working
through electoral channels, anarchist revolution proceeds through direct
action—people collectively taking what they need and building what they
desire without asking permission. This includes strikes, occupations,
expropriation, and the creation of alternative institutions.

**Prefigurative Practice**: Revolutionary organizing must embody
anarchist principles in its means, not defer them to post-revolutionary
futures. Worker assemblies, affinity groups, communes, and other
revolutionary structures should operate through direct democracy,
voluntary association, and mutual aid. These forms of organization are
simultaneously means of revolution and seeds of the new society.

**Insurrection and Construction**: Revolution requires both the
destructive moment of revolt against domination and the constructive
work of building alternatives. Insurrection clears away old institutions
while construction establishes new ones. Both occur simultaneously and
continuously rather than in discrete stages.

Historical examples include the
<a href="Paris_Commune" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a>, the <a href="Makhnovist_movement" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine,
<a href="Revolutionary_Spain" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist Spain">anarchist Spain</a> during the revolution of
1936-1939, and countless smaller experiments in revolutionary
transformation.

### Building Prefigurative / Dual Power

Because revolutionary transformation cannot happen instantly, anarchists
advocate <a href="Prefiguration" class="wikilink"
title="prefiguration">prefiguration</a> or building "dual
power"—creating alternative institutions that meet needs and coordinate
activity outside state and capitalist structures, gradually making
hierarchical institutions irrelevant while demonstrating the viability
of anarchist organization.

**Worker Organizations**: <a href="Syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary unions">Revolutionary unions</a> and worker
cooperatives that organize production democratically. These provide
immediate improvements in working conditions while building capacity for
worker control of the economy. Historical examples include the CNT in
Spain, the IWW internationally, and contemporary worker cooperatives
worldwide.

**Community Assemblies**: Neighborhood and municipal organizations that
coordinate local affairs through direct democracy. These range from
informal community groups to structured
<a href="municipalism" class="wikilink"
title="municipal confederations">municipal confederations</a> like those
proposed by Murray Bookchin.

**Mutual Aid Networks**: Voluntary associations for meeting needs
outside market and state mechanisms. These include food cooperatives,
time banks, skill-sharing networks, community gardens, and countless
other forms of mutual support.

**Counter-Institutions**: Alternative structures that provide what
states and markets currently monopolize—free schools, community defense
groups, health collectives, social centers. These demonstrate that
people can meet their needs without hierarchy.

As these institutions grow stronger and more interconnected, they can
increasingly replace hierarchical structures, allowing people to
"withdraw from coercive systems and build genuine autonomy through
collective action."[^15]

### Individual and Collective Struggle

Obtaining freedom requires both individual revolt and collective
transformation. As Bakunin emphasized, we must rebel against three forms
of tyranny:

**Against Divine Authority**: Rejecting religion and all forms of
transcendent authority. "As long as we have a master in heaven, we will
be slaves on earth."[^16] Freedom requires recognizing that moral and
spiritual truth comes from human experience and reflection, not divine
command.

**Against State Authority**: Resisting all forms of legal domination and
political hierarchy. This means both refusing to obey and actively
disrupting state power through non-compliance, direct action, and
building alternatives.

**Against Social Tyranny**: Rebelling against "the natural influence" of
social pressure, custom, and conformity. This is often more difficult
than resisting formal authority because social conditioning operates
invisibly, shaping our desires and sense of possibility. It requires
conscious effort to think independently and act authentically despite
social pressure.

These struggles are interconnected. Bakunin noted that "revolt against
this natural society is far more difficult for the individual than
revolt against the officially organized society of the State" because
social influence shapes us from birth.[^17] Yet without challenging
internalized domination, external revolution remains incomplete.

## Maintaining Freedom

### Vigilance Against Authority

Freedom once achieved requires constant vigilance against the
re-emergence of hierarchy. As Bakunin observed, "there is something in
the very nature of the State that provokes revolt,"[^18] yet social
domination can be more insidious precisely because it appears natural.

**Institutional Safeguards**: Free societies must embed
anti-authoritarian principles in their structures. This includes
rotation of responsibilities, strict mandating and recall of delegates,
consensus decision-making that requires addressing everyone's concerns,
and transparency in all collective affairs.

**Cultural Resistance**: Maintaining "antibodies" against domination
through education, social norms that stigmatize authority-seeking, and
celebration of autonomous thought and action. Children must be raised to
think critically rather than obey.

**Immediate Response to Hierarchy**: The moment any person or group
claims authority over others, this must be challenged and dismantled.
Waiting until authority is established makes resistance more difficult
and costly.

### Federative Coordination

Free societies require coordination across groups and regions, but this
must not recreate centralized authority.
<a href="Federalism" class="wikilink"
title="Federative structures">Federative structures</a> maintain freedom
through several principles:

**Subsidiarity**: Decisions should be made at the most local level
possible, with coordination across scales only for matters requiring it.
This prevents distant bodies from controlling local affairs.

**Delegation Not Representation**: Delegates carry specific mandates
from their assemblies rather than claiming to represent others'
interests. They can be immediately recalled if they exceed their
mandate.

**Voluntary Association**: Groups federate voluntarily and can withdraw
if federation becomes oppressive. The threat of exit constrains any
federative body from overreach.

**Horizontal Relations**: Federations coordinate among equals rather
than imposing decisions from above. No federative body has coercive
power over member groups.

Historical examples include the Swiss confederation that influenced
Proudhon, the federative structure of the Spanish CNT-FAI, and the
municipal confederalism practiced in Rojava.

### Economic Democracy

Maintaining freedom requires ongoing collective control over production
and distribution. This means:

**Worker Self-Management**: Those who produce must continue to
collectively control their workplaces. Any return to separation between
ownership and labor recreates class domination.

**Commons Stewardship**: Resources must remain collectively managed with
universal access. Private property inevitably concentrates and creates
dependency relations.

**Needs-Based Distribution**: Ensuring everyone's needs are met prevents
economic coercion from re-emerging. If access to necessities becomes
conditional, this leverage will be used for control.

**Resistance to Accumulation**: Opposing attempts to accumulate wealth
or resources beyond personal use. Such accumulation provides the
material basis for domination.

### Ongoing Revolution

Freedom is not a static condition but requires continuous revolutionary
activity. As Amedeo Bertolo argues, anarchism "does not represent a
final state of affairs, but a direction, a vector pointing beyond all
possible compromises."[^19]

This means:

**Permanent Critique**: Continuously examining institutions and
relations for emerging hierarchies and domination. No structure is
sacrosanct.

**Openness to Change**: Maintaining flexibility to adapt organizational
forms as circumstances change and new needs emerge.

**Generational Renewal**: Each generation must actively embrace and
recreate freedom rather than inheriting it passively. This requires
education that cultivates autonomous thought.

**Expansion of Freedom**: Always working to deepen freedom, extend it to
new domains, and include those previously excluded. Freedom is never
complete as long as anyone remains unfree.

## How Freedom Is Lost

### Compromise with Authority

Freedom is most often lost through gradual compromise with hierarchy
rather than sudden imposition. This can occur through several
mechanisms:

**Revolutionary Substitution**: When movements allow leaders or
vanguards to act "on behalf of" the masses, these representatives
invariably become a new ruling class. The
<a href="Russian_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> demonstrated this
dramatically—Bolshevik centralization quickly transformed revolutionary
soviets into totalitarian state apparatus.

**Institutional Ossification**: Organizations created for liberation can
become bureaucratic and hierarchical over time. Unions become
collaborationist, cooperatives adopt corporate structures, and movements
develop leadership castes. Preventing this requires constant
institutional renewal and anti-hierarchical vigilance.

**Seduction of Gradual Reform**: The promise of incremental change
through existing institutions leads to accepting their logic and
constraints. Anarchists who enter parliaments or negotiate with states
gradually adopt statist thinking. As
<a href="Errico_Malatesta" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> warned, "anarchists in
government cease to be anarchists."

**Single-Issue Narrowing**: When movements abandon comprehensive
critique of domination for narrow reforms, they lose sight of freedom's
interconnected nature. Winning specific gains while accepting overall
hierarchy leaves freedom fragile and reversible.

### Economic Dependency

Material insecurity and artificial scarcity create leverage for control.
When survival depends on submitting to authority, freedom becomes
impossible:

**Wage Slavery**: The need to sell one's labor to survive gives
employers coercive power over workers. The "freedom" to choose one's
master is no freedom at all when the alternative is destitution.

**Debt Bondage**: Systems of credit and debt create long-term obligation
and control. Mortgage debt, student loans, and other financial
instruments trap people in relations of domination.

**Artificial Scarcity**: Capitalism creates artificial scarcity through
private property, creating competition where cooperation is possible.
This manufactured insecurity justifies authority claimed necessary to
"maintain order."

**Enclosure of Commons**: Privatization of land, knowledge, and
resources transforms what was freely accessible into controlled
property. The historical enclosure of common lands forced peasants into
wage labor; contemporary enclosure of intellectual commons has similar
effects.

### Social Control

Domination operates not just through force but through shaping
consciousness, desires, and social relations:

**Hegemonic Ideology**: When people internalize ruling ideas—that
hierarchy is natural, authority necessary, capitalism inevitable—they
reproduce domination even without direct coercion. As Bakunin observed,
most people "faithfully conform and follow tradition and routine"
because they have been shaped by society to do so.[^20]

**Manufactured Consent**: Mass media and education systems create
consensus around existing arrangements while marginalizing alternatives.
People believe they think freely while reproducing authorized ideas.

**Divide and Rule**: Authority maintains itself by creating artificial
divisions—nationalism, racism, sexism—that prevent the exploited from
recognizing common interests and acting together.

**Normalization of Hierarchy**: When domination becomes familiar and
traditional, it appears natural rather than constructed. People defend
their chains, viewing liberation as unrealistic or dangerous.

### Physical Repression

When more subtle methods fail, authority resorts to violence:

**State Violence**: Police and military force suppress resistance and
enforce compliance. The threat of imprisonment, injury, or death deters
many from challenging authority directly.

**Mass Incarceration**: Removing dissidents and resisters from society
while terrorizing others into conformity. The
<a href="prison_system" class="wikilink" title="prison system">prison
system</a> serves as explicit warning of consequences for serious
non-compliance.

**Surveillance**: Monitoring populations creates chilling effects where
people self-censor to avoid attention. The mere possibility of
surveillance constrains freedom even when not actively monitored.

**Assassination and Disappearance**: Eliminating movement leaders and
spreading terror among communities. State and right-wing violence has
murdered countless anarchists worldwide.

## Why Only Anarchism Fully Honors Freedom

### Beyond Liberal Freedom

Liberalism claims to champion freedom but accepts and defends
fundamental unfreedom:

**Property as Domination**: Liberalism treats property rights as freedom
while ignoring that private ownership of means of production creates
relations of domination. The "freedom" to own others' workplaces is
freedom to rule, not freedom itself.

**Formal vs. Substantive Freedom**: Liberal rights mean nothing without
material capacity to exercise them. Freedom of speech matters little if
you lack platforms or if economic insecurity prevents speaking
uncomfortable truths. Freedom of movement is hollow if you're homeless
or trapped by debt. Anarchism recognizes that formal freedom requires
substantive foundations.

**State as Necessary Evil**: Liberalism accepts state authority as
required to protect liberty, not recognizing that this "protection"
itself restricts freedom. The state's monopoly on violence and lawmaking
denies human capacity for self-organization.

**Atomistic Individualism**: Liberal freedom imagines isolated
individuals whose freedom consists in being left alone. This ignores
that humans are social beings whose individuality emerges through
collective life. True freedom is not isolation but rich, voluntary
social connection.

As Dora Marsden argued, liberal "freedom" amounts to "allowed speech"
granted by those with power, not genuine freedom at all. Real freedom
exists only where one has sufficient power to act, and this power can
only be built collectively.[^21]

### Beyond Authoritarian Socialism

Authoritarian socialism claims to pursue equality and collective welfare
but sacrifices freedom in the attempt:

**Vanguardism**: Marxist-Leninist theory posits that workers cannot
achieve class consciousness without external leadership. This denies
human capacity for self-liberation and justifies permanent rule by party
elites.

**Revolutionary Dictatorship**: The claim that freedom must be deferred
until after revolutionary transformation establishes a "workers' state"
creates new forms of domination that prove permanent. As Bakunin
predicted in his critique of Marx, "no dictatorship can have any other
aim but that of self-perpetuation."

**Economic Centralization**: State socialist planning concentrates
economic power in bureaucratic hands, replacing capitalist bosses with
party officials. Workers remain alienated from control over production.

**Compulsory Collectivization**: Forcing people into collective
arrangements violates individual autonomy and creates resentment rather
than solidarity. Genuine cooperation must be voluntary or it becomes
another form of domination.

Authoritarian socialism demonstrates that equality without freedom
becomes shared servitude. As Bertolo argues, anarchism alone recognizes
that "freedom and equality have become compatible" through "strong
equality" that ensures equal freedom rather than equal unfreedom.[^22]

### The Anarchist Synthesis

Only anarchism maintains fidelity to freedom because it recognizes and
addresses freedom's full requirements:

**Comprehensive Anti-Authoritarianism**: Anarchism opposes all forms of
domination—political, economic, social, cultural—rather than accepting
some hierarchies while fighting others. This prevents partial freedom
that leaves fundamental unfreedom in place.

**Positive and Negative Unity**: Anarchism embraces both freedom from
domination and freedom for self-development, recognizing these as
inseparable. We cannot be free merely by removing constraints; we must
also create enabling conditions.

**Individual and Collective Integration**: Anarchism affirms both
individual autonomy and social solidarity, recognizing that genuine
individuality emerges through collective life. We achieve freedom not
despite but through one another.

**Prefigurative Politics**: Anarchism insists that means must embody
ends, that we cannot achieve freedom through authoritarian methods. This
ensures freedom is practiced immediately rather than eternally deferred.

**Material Foundations**: Anarchism recognizes that freedom requires
material security and collective control over resources, not just
abstract rights or formal equality.

**Ongoing Revolution**: Anarchism treats freedom as continuous activity
rather than final state, requiring permanent vigilance against new forms
of domination.

As William Gillis concludes, "Your freedom is my freedom because freedom
tolerates no divisions, accepts no adjectives, belongs to no one. There
is simply freedom or constraint. Liberation or rulership."[^23] Only
anarchism fully embraces this uncompromising vision and pursues the
total abolition of domination in all its forms.

## Criticisms

### The Stability Objection

Critics argue that anarchist freedom is unstable, that absence of
central authority leads to chaos or domination by the strong. This
objection assumes authority creates order rather than recognizing that
most human cooperation occurs despite authority rather than because of
it. Historical evidence from
<a href="indigenous_societies" class="wikilink"
title="indigenous societies">indigenous societies</a> to modern mutual
aid networks demonstrates that people naturally cooperate when not
prevented by hierarchical institutions. The "chaos" attributed to
anarchy typically describes transitional periods where old authorities
have collapsed but new voluntary institutions have not yet developed, or
situations where states actively destabilize anarchist experiments
through violence and blockade.

### The Complexity Objection

Some argue that complex modern society requires hierarchical
coordination, that horizontal organization cannot manage large-scale
industry or coordinate across distances. This ignores the complexity of
actually existing anarchist organizations like revolutionary unions with
hundreds of thousands of members successfully managing production, and
misunderstands federative structures that enable coordination without
hierarchy. Modern communication technology actually makes horizontal
coordination easier, while hierarchical systems regularly prove
incapable of managing complexity, as their centralization concentrates
both power and ignorance.

### The Scarcity Objection

Critics claim anarchist freedom requires impossible abundance, that
scarcity necessitates authority to allocate resources. This inverts
cause and effect—scarcity under capitalism is largely artificial,
created through private property and production for profit rather than
need. Commons-based management has historically maintained resources
sustainably while ensuring access. Moreover, the objection assumes a
level of absolute scarcity that has rarely existed; even in harsh
conditions, human societies have organized cooperation rather than
requiring authority to prevent war of all against all.

### The Human Nature Objection

Perhaps most common is the claim that humans are naturally selfish or
violent and thus require authority to maintain order. This objection
projects behaviors shaped by hierarchical society onto "human nature."
Anthropological evidence shows tremendous human variation, with many
societies exhibiting high levels of cooperation and equality. Even in
contemporary capitalism, most daily interactions are cooperative rather
than competitive. The traits used to justify authority—greed, violence,
domination—flourish in hierarchical systems precisely because such
systems reward them. As Bakunin noted, a person born among slaves
becomes slavish, while one born in freedom develops autonomous
character. Human behavior is shaped by social conditions; transforming
those conditions transforms behavior.

## Contemporary Relevance

The anarchist understanding of freedom has renewed urgency in
contemporary conditions:

**Digital Surveillance**: States and corporations monitor populations at
unprecedented scale, creating
"<a href="surveillance_capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="surveillance capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>" that tracks
and shapes behavior. Anarchist insistence on privacy and resistance to
authority provides crucial framework for opposing this totalizing
control.

**Climate Crisis**:
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a>'s
drive for endless accumulation creates ecological catastrophe that
threatens all freedom by destroying conditions for human life. Anarchist
economics based on needs rather than profit provides alternative path.

**Authoritarian Resurgence**: Fascist and authoritarian movements
worldwide demonstrate bankruptcy of liberal faith that formal democracy
ensures freedom. Anarchist comprehensive anti-authoritarianism and
emphasis on direct action offer resistance.

**Precarity and Debt**: Neoliberal capitalism intensifies economic
insecurity and dependency while privatizing public goods. Anarchist
mutual aid and commons provide practical alternatives.

**Movements for Liberation**: Contemporary movements from
<a href="Rojava" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> to
<a href="Zapatismo" class="wikilink" title="Zapatismo">Zapatismo</a> to
<a href="Occupy" class="wikilink" title="Occupy">Occupy</a> demonstrate
renewed interest in horizontal organization and direct democracy,
applying anarchist principles even when not explicitly identifying as
anarchist.

The anarchist conception of freedom provides theoretical clarity and
practical tools for confronting these challenges. As states and capital
tighten control, the anarchist insistence that freedom and authority are
absolute opposites becomes increasingly vital.
