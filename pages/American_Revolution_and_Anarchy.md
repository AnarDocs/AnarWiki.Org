Beginning in the 1760s, the American Revolution initially brought
together sailors, runaway slaves, working-class women, and multiethnic
mobs of common people. Revolting against British and American tyrannies
alike, the mobs were dismissed for their "anarchia." Escaping slave
plantations, demanding Indigenous sovereignty, and fighting for local
autonomy, these elements often did not fit neatly onto either the
British side (demanding continued colonial rule) or the official
American side (establishing a settler-colonial and slave-holding state).

More authoritarian elements led by the "Founding Fathers" initiated what
Gerald Horne describes as the Counter-Revolution of 1776. Excluding most
African Americans, indigenous peoples, and women, leaders, according to
Howard Zinn, "created the most effective system of national control
devised in modern times, and showed future generations of leaders the
advantages of combining paternalism with command."[^1] Among the
Founders, the working-class pamphleteer Thomas Paine came the closest to
articulating a liberatory vision. Paine denounced slavery as "contrary
to the light of nature, to every principle of Justice and Humanity, and
even good policy."[^2] He described the revolution as a time when
"governments had been abolished" and as evidence that, "The instant
formal government is abolished, society begins to act: a general
association takes place, and common interest produces common
security."[^3]

Britain's colonial rule of America followed a mercantile pattern,
ensuring that "the colonists were not to manufacture anything that would
compete with British industry. Rather Americans were to be consumers
exclusively of English manufactures." Britain reinforced this
exploitative relationship with policies such as the Stamp Act (that
required colonists to put a stamp on many documents and items, including
wills, deeds, contracts, calendars and playing cards), the Declaratory
Act (that affirmed Britain's right to inflict legislation on colonies
"in all cases whatsoever”), the Townshend Act (that placed tariffs on a
variety of goods, including lead, glass, paper, paint and tea), and the
Intolerable Acts (that, among other things, blockaded the port of Boston
and limited Massachusetts' town meetings to once a year).[^4]

Political upheaval in the colonies took off in the 1760s, and the
Continental Congress approved its famous Declaration of Independence on
July, 4, 1776. In September 1783, American and British representatives
signed the Treaty of Paris, recognizing American independence.[^5]

# Radical Roots

The radical historians Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker argue that the
American Revolution "was neither an elite nor a national event, since
its genesis, process, outcome, and influence all depended on the
circulation of proletarian experience around the Atlantic."[^6]

Beginning in the 1740s, sailors led riots against impressment (forcing
people to serve in the navy). In the 1760s, multi-ethnic crowds of
Atlantic sailors attacked the property of slave-trading merchants and
other elites in England's cities of Liverpool and London. The crowds in
London were smeared as "immediate sons of Jamaica, or African Blacks by
Asiatic Mulatoes." Such riots eventually led Thomas Paine (the most
radical and working-class of the Founding Fathers) to oppose impressment
in his hugely popular 1776 revolutionary pamphlet *Common Sense* and led
Thomas Jefferson to include impressment as one of the grievances in the
Declaration of Independence.[^7]

Slaves' revolts provided another root of revolution. Tacky's Revolt took
off in Jamaica in 1760. The revolt lasted for a year after the main
leader, Tacky, was captured. Another one of the leaders was Cubah, a
female slave who became known as "The Queen." Most sailors refused to
fight against the rebelling slaves. One rebel explained, "As for the
sailors, you see that they do not oppose us." The revolt inspired other
revolts in the colonies. Slaves rose up in Virginia in 1767, in New
Jersey in 1772, in South Carolina and Boston (along with Irish rebels)
in 1774, and in South Carolina and North Carolina in 1775. In the wake
of these revolts, Paine and other propagandists wrote against
slavery.[^8]

Multi-ethnic mobs protested against colonial laws imposed by the
British: the Stamp Act, the Quartering Act, the Townshend Revenue Act,
the Tea Act, and the Intolerable Acts. Based on these mobs, Benjamin
Rush later coined a new insanity called *anarchia* meaning the
"excessive love of liberty."[^9]

Common people organized non-importation committees to enforce a boycott
of British imports. The committees tarred and feathered loyalist
(meaning pro-monarchy) activists and enforced ostracism against them.
The committees "enforced the standards of popular revolutionary
behavior."[^10] Women took active roles such as turning spinning bees
into overtly political events, shopping for the household in accordance
with the anti-British boycott, feeding soldiers, writing poems, and
signing petitions.[^11]

# Massachusetts and the Committees of Correspondence

After Britain revoked the courts' independence from the king, Sam Adams
re-established in 1772 the Boston Committee of Correspondence, a
rebellious shadow government accountable to Boston's
<a href="New_England_town_meetings.md" class="wikilink"
title="town meetings">town meetings</a>. The Committee helped other
towns organize their own Committees, and within two months, eighty
Massachussetts towns formed Committees of Correspondence. Committees
emerged throughout the thirteen American colonies, and Bookchin writes
that they “became the embryos of a later, more grassroots network for
revolutionary organization and action.”[^12]

In 1773, in an attempt to break the colonists' boycott of British tea,
Britain let the East India Company sell tea in the colonies at greatly
reduced prices. The Boston Committee of Correspondence called an
extra-legal “Meeting of the People”, and in a resulting action now known
as the Boston Tea Party, citizens from the Committee boarded ships and
dumped 75,000 pounds worth of tea into the Boston harbor.[^13]

In 1774, rebels throughout Massachusetts "joined together to form an
extralegal county convention to coordinate and direct provincial
political activity...Functioning essentially as confederations of
municipalities, the conventions were themselves managed like town
meetings, with elected moderators, reporting committees, and open votes,
thereby constituting a far-flung direct democracy.”[^14]

# Committees of Safety and the Militias

Provincial assemblies, Committees of Correspondence and other
extra-legal bodies sent delegates to meet in Philadelphia on 5 September
1774, forming the First Continental Congress. The Congress called for a
boycott of British goods, and by July 1775, it called on each colony to
form its own Committee of Safety. These Committees became an executive
body for the revolution, and they gave to the press the known names of
people who refused to follow the boycott. Once military operations
began, the Committees began coordinating military efforts, enlisting
troops, setting quotas for the number of militias that each town was
expected to produce, and confiscating loyalist property. [^15]

# Internal Revolutions

A number of revolts signified a revolution *within* the broader American
Revolution. In 1766, tenant farmers in Westchester, New York went on
rent strike and were evicted. The tenants rose up, took arms, smashed
the Poughkeepsie jail, drove out local officials and threatened to march
on New York city. The New York Sons of Liberty sided with the landowners
and urged rural troops to crush the uprising. The royal troops did so.

In North and South Carolina, crooked county authorities “routinely
overcharged ordinary people for their services and formed what amounted
to a scandolous extortion ring. Justices of the peace demanded
exorbinant fees for their dizying array of services theyt concoted,
while the sheriffs embezzled part of the tax revenues they collected
sometimes charging more than the required legal amount.” In response,
farmers mobilized militias and demanded the “regulation” of the tax
system, including a transparent acounting of county finances. They
became known as the Regulators. In 1770, the Regulators invaded North
Carolina's Orange County court, evicted the judges and tried cases
themselves. They were crushed by the governor. Many of these farmers
became pro-British.

In Pennsylvania, an struggle emerged between the farmers and the wealthy
merchants and lawyers. The radical Charles Thomson, although a merchant
himself, organized a movement of mechanics that resisted the Tea Act
and, along with other colonists in 1774, blocked the unloading of the
East India Company's tea in Philadelphia. In May 1774, Philadelphians
conducted a day-long general strike that shut down the port and regular
business.[^16]

# African American involvement and opposition

In 1765 in Charleston, South Carolina, white crowds yelled "Liberty!" in
protest of the Stamp Act. A small group of slaves then repeated the
chant, "Liberty!," sending the whites into panic.[^17] The contrasting
calls for freedom by enslavers and enslaved alike underscored a tension
running through the revolutionary era. In general, African Americans
played off the conflict in order to secure their own freedom whenever
possible. Herbert Aptheker summarized in a 1940 study:

> Where and when possible, that is, where and when they were permitted
> to do so, and given freedom for doing so, Negroes served the forces
> which were in rebellion against British tyranny, but where and when
> this was not possible they fled to the British armies, or to Florida,
> or to Canada, and some actually fought in the King’s army. And where
> this, too, was not possible, some fled into neighboring swamps,
> forests, and mountains resisting whomsoever sought to re-enslave them;
> still others, finding escape impossible, conspired or rebelled for
> freedom.[^18]

According to Gerald Horne's *The Counter-Revolution of 1776*, two key
moments signalled to many African Americans the importance of British
victory. First, London’s June 1772 court case, pitting the enslaved
African James Somerset against his master Charles Steuart, ended in a
ruling that not only freed Somerset but "in effect \[…\] outlawed”
slavery in England." Second, in 1775, Virginia's royal governor Lord
Dunmore issued an edict offering liberty to slaves who fled and joined
the British army.[^19] As Horne demonstrates, these two events terrified
wealthy settlers. Voices from the *Boston Gazette* to Edward Long of
Jamaica decried the ruling as, in Long’s words, a sign that “slave
holding might perhaps be very well discontinued in every province of the
North American continent.” Early in the month of Dunmore’s edict, Thomas
Jefferson considered independence to be off the table. After the edict,
however, Jefferson fretted that “the person of No Man in the Colony is
safe” from vengeance. Patrick Henry (another Founding Father) warned
that Dunmore’s edict was “fatal to the public safety.” Virginians
denounced Dunmore’s edict as an “encouragement to a general
insurrection.” Even England’s Duke of Manchester acknowledged that
“Americans were greatly incensed against the King” for “encouraging the
black slaves to rise and cut the throats of their masters.”[^20]
Benjamin Franklin warned, “every slave must be reckoned a domestic
enemy.”[^21]

Many slaves, especially in the southern colonies, seized the opportunity
and joined the British side in the war. J. Sakai notes:

> It was Afrikans who greeted the war with great enthusiasm. But while
> the settler slavemasters sought ‘democracy’ through wresting their
> nationhood away from England, their slaves sought liberation by
> overthrowing Amerika or escaping from it. Far from being either
> patriotic Amerikan subjects or passively enslaved neutrals, the
> Afrikan masses threw themselves daringly and passionately into the
> jaws of war on an unprecedented scale-that is, into their own war,
> against slave Amerika and for freedom \[...\] The war was a disruption
> to Slave Amerika, a chaotic gap in the European capitalist ranks to be
> hit hard. Afrikans seized the time--not by the tens or hundreds, but
> by the many thousands. Amerika shook with the tremors of their
> movement. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were bitter
> about their personal losses: Thomas Jefferson lost many of his slaves
> \[...\] The thousands of rebellious Afrikans sustained the British war
> machinery. After all, if the price of refuge from the slavemaster was
> helping the British throw down the settlers, it was not such a
> distasteful task.[^22]

The British did not treat African American rebels with respect, however.
Black soldiers received little or no wages after deductions for food.
They were given inferior food and were the first to have rations cut in
times of scarcity. They were given separate and inferior living
quarters.[^23]

Many other African Americans, especially in the north, fought on the
rebels' side. Peter Salem, a enslaved African, joined the rebels and
fired the shot that killed the British Major John Pitcairn at Bunker
Hill. Salem joined because his master promised him freedom as a
reward.[^24] Crispus Attuckus, who seems to have been a former slave,
rallied against the British and was one of the victims of the Boston
Massacre.[^25]

Between 1764 and 1773, several of the Founding Father George
Washington's enslaved Africans, with names recorded as Breechy, Cloe,
Tom, Bett, (another) Tom, Will Shagg, Coachman Jemmy, and additionally
the indentured servant Michael Tracey, escaped from Washington's
plantation. In 1781, 17 slaves escaped from Washington.[^26]

# Native American involvement and opposition

In general, Native Americans took actions to try to preserve their
autonomy and to play settler and colonial forces against each other.
When taking a side, they more often aligned with the British. "All
during the war Indian and Afrikan guerrillas struck at the settlers," J.
Sakai writes.[^27]

Members of the Western Abenakis fought for both the British and the
Americans, depending on who would pay more. They tended to stay out of
the firing line, refusing to sacrifice their lives for either side.[^28]
Most of the <a href="Haudennosaunne.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haudennosaunne">Haudennosaunne</a> fought with the British,
especially after they noticed the anti-Indian rhetoric of the Americans'
Declaration of Independence.[^29] The Deleware signed the 1778 Treaty
with the Americans that promised an all-Indian state would be added to
the new republic. The American leaders never seriously considered
honoring their promise and did not fulfil it.[^30]

# Shays' Rebellion

In 1786 and 1787, Daniel Shays led an armed uprising among poor and
indebted farmers in Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire and
Massachusetts. According to Bookchin, the Shayite militias in
Masschusetts were well-disciplined and "were organized along typically
libertarian lines, structured around county committees (“Committees of
the People”), each of which assumed military leadership of the armed
forces in every county and remained its highest military unit." Colonist
elites quickly crushed the rebellion. "Had they won," Bookchin writes,
"Massachusetts, conceivably, could have become a confederal democracy,
not unlike early Switzerland, and yeomen throughout New England could
have tried to emulate them. In any case, together with the revolutionary
events in Pennsylvania during the war, Shay's rebellion was as close as
America came to an insurrectionary third revolution.”[^31]

# Legacy and the 1789 Constitution

There is disagreement about whether the revolution and the resulting
1789 United States Constitution ultimately weakened or strengthened
forces of domination. On one hand, it did secure a victory against the
powerful British empire and against monarchical rule. While America's
new government excluded women, Indians, and blacks from participating,
its implementation of republicanism was radically inclusive for its
time. Gordon Wood, a conservative historian, argues that the revolution
levelled a highly repressive social hierarchy and even "made possible
the anti-slavery and women's movements of the nineteenth century and in
fact all our current egalitarian thinking."[^32] According to Ray
Raphael, the revolution weakened the institution of slavery: "Changing
economic factors, the humanitarian concerns of some masters, and the
refusal of many slaves to accept their status led to an increase in the
number of free blacks during the decades following the war."[^33]

Linebaugh and Rediker, however, describe the Founding Fathers'
intervention as "an American Thermidor," or in other words a
counter-revolution that undid the work of grassroots radical
revolutionaries. They assert, "The Constitution also strengthened the
institution of slavery by extending the slave trade, providing for the
return of fugitive slaves and giving national political power to the
plantation master class."[^34] Even Wood acknowledges that the
Constitution was designed, rather undemocratically, "to temper popular
majoritarianism."[^35] And Raphael finds that the revolution and the
Americans' victory "weakened and divided" Indians and "hastened the
demise of their sovereign status."[^36]
