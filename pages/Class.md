# Class

## Overview

Class refers to the hierarchical divisions within society based on
economic relationships, political power, and social control. Anarchists
recognize class as a fundamental system of exploitation and domination,
though they conceptualize it more broadly than purely economic terms.

## Origins

Class divisions emerged with the development of agriculture, settled
communities, and the accumulation of surplus wealth. Throughout history,
class exploitation has been organized through various modes of
production. Prior to capitalism, these included the feudal mode of
production in parts of Europe, Africa and Asia (based on the
exploitation of unfree farmers by warrior-landlords and knights) and the
tributary mode of production (based on the conquest and exploitation of
farming communities by a ruling class controlling access to land,
cattle, trade, and military force).[^1]

At every stage of class society there has been an oppressed class whose
labour created the wealth of that society, and a ruling class who
controlled that wealth. Throughout history, the oppressed have fought
back through slave revolts in Rome and Greece, peasant risings in Europe
and Asia, and working class struggle in the modern era.

## Class Under Capitalism

### The Working Class

The modern class system under capitalism is based on the pursuit of
profit and competition between firms to sell commodities on the market.
The working class neither owns nor controls the means of production and
is therefore forced to work for wages without real control over the work
process or society. The working class includes industrial workers, rural
workers, white collar workers, service workers, the unemployed, and
other marginalized groups sometimes called the lumpenproletariat.[^2]

Workers as a collectivity have a special relation to the means of
production. Lacking land or machines, they must sell their ability to
work (labour power) to capitalists. Workers produce enough commodities
to equal the value of their wages, then continue working to produce
surplus value, which forms the basis of capitalist profits. This
exploitation occurs not just individually but collectively, as workers
must cooperate in the workplace and throughout society to keep the
system functioning.

The working class is broader than just employed wage workers. It
includes unemployed and retired workers, homemakers married to workers,
and their children. It is a whole class counterposed to the capitalist
class.[^3]

### The Ruling Class

The ruling class owns and controls the predominant part of the means of
production and controls the labour power of others. It also exercises
control over the State apparatus. This class includes big business
owners, corporate executives, top politicians of all parties, high-level
civil servants, and military leadership. The opposite side of capitalist
rule is the impoverishment and subjugation of labourers, with a small
minority enjoying wealth while the majority suffers various degrees of
deprivation.[^4]

However, anarchist analysis expands beyond purely economic ownership to
emphasize political and social power. The ruling class includes not only
capitalists but state bureaucrats, party officials, managers, and
professional administrators who exercise power over others regardless of
their relationship to capital ownership. This became especially relevant
in analyzing state socialist societies where capitalist property
relations were abolished but clear class divisions remained between
party officials and ordinary workers.

### The Middle Class

The middle class is made up of three elements: small employers who have
control and ownership of means of production but employ few people;
middle-level managers and foremen who exercise limited control over
investment decisions and labour but do not own the means of production;
and professionals who work for wages but have significant control over
how they do their work. This class provides the middle management of
capitalism and the State, technical skills and expertise to the ruling
class, and produces much of mainstream culture.[^5]

The middle class is not truly an independent class but represents
elements of both the ruling and working classes, usually orienting
toward one or the other in social conflicts.

## Anarchist Class Analysis

### Beyond Economic Reductionism

While anarchists recognize economic class divisions between those who
own and control the means of production and those who must sell their
labour, anarchist class theory emphasizes power relations more broadly.
The key anarchist insight is that exploitation occurs wherever there are
hierarchical power relationships, not only in economic production.

Mikhail Bakunin explicitly warned about a "new class" of socialist
intellectuals and bureaucrats who would replace capitalist exploitation
with their own domination. This analysis proved prescient in state
socialist societies where the abolition of capitalist property ownership
did not eliminate class exploitation but transformed it into political
domination by party bureaucrats and managers.

Anarchists emphasize the managerial and coordination class (those who
control labour processes and information flows) as distinct exploiters,
not simply servants of capital. Class struggle is viewed as one crucial
struggle among several interconnected ones, alongside struggles against
state power, patriarchy, racism, colonialism, and other systems of
domination. Class is not necessarily always primary, though it remains
central to understanding capitalist society.[^6]

### The Special Role of Class

Despite this broader analysis, class maintains a strategic importance.
The goal of working class revolution is the total overturning of the
capitalist class and its destruction as a class, replacing it with
stateless rule of the working class moving toward a classless society.
Unlike other oppressions where the goal is reorganizing relations
between groups, class struggle aims at eliminating class divisions
entirely.

The capitalist class actually runs society as the ruling class. Though
only 1 to 5 percent of the population, capitalists control production of
goods and services, determine employment and unemployment, control
political parties through wealth and influence, own and run mass media,
and dominate government at all levels. Their class rule must be
completely overturned for fundamental social change.

The working class possesses unique potential power among oppressed
groups. Only workers can stop society altogether by withdrawing their
labour, and only they can restart it on a new basis. Workers produce
goods, transport them, distribute them, and serve people's needs. This
gives the working class enormous potential power that almost all
capitalist politics exists to prevent workers from recognizing and
using.[^7]

### Intersections with Other Oppressions

Each form of oppression must be analyzed in its concreteness. The
systems of class exploitation, patriarchy, white supremacy, colonialism,
and other oppressions overlap and interact. They are not parallel
structures but intertwined systems that lean on and support each other.

For example, white supremacy serves class purposes by creating a pool of
workers who can be super-exploited at low wages and weakening the
overall working class through racial divisions. Similarly, women's
oppression is directly related to their role in the nuclear family,
which under capitalism is a center of consumption and where labour power
is reproduced. Each oppression supports all others; they all support
capitalist exploitation and are supported by it.[^8]

The rebellion of the working class, especially those on the very bottom,
shakes up everything and raises every issue affecting every section of
society. However, a working class-led revolution must be the conscious
self-liberation of all the oppressed, with the proletariat holding
together all these rebellious forces and channeling them into
revolution.

## Class and the State

All class systems are supported by the State, which can be understood as
a hierarchically structured coercive authority governing a particular
territory. The main organs of the State are the police, army, judiciary
and civil service. The functions of the State are to defend and
legitimise the unjust class system.[^9]

The State emerged with the division of society into classes and is
designed to protect the ruling and exploiting minority from the
oppressed classes. Economic exploitation and the coercive institutions
of political power have always gone hand in hand. The State defends the
whole ruling class, not just economic interests but also generals,
politicians and top civil servants. The State is not simply a tool of
economic interests but a structure of domination in its own right with
its own dynamics.

The State cannot be used to secure liberation of the working class,
whether through parliamentary reform or through the so-called workers'
State. The State is an hierarchical structure built to allow a minority
to rule over the rest of society. Any attempt to use State structures as
a means to liberate the masses can only result in the rule of yet
another small minority, which rapidly assumes all features of a ruling
class. This analysis was confirmed by the experience of state socialist
societies where party bureaucrats became a new ruling class despite the
abolition of capitalist property relations.

## Class Struggle

Class exploitation generates class struggle between exploiters and
exploited. This takes place both at work and in the community and may
appear under various ideological banners including nationalist,
feminist, or religious movements. In order to end the class system,
anarchists argue that revolution by the working class is necessary. Only
in this way can the masses take control of their lives and enjoy the
fruits of their labour.

Only a productive class can build a free society because only a
productive class does not need to exploit. The revolution must destroy
capitalism, the State and all forms of oppression, and build a new
self-managed society based on worker councils developing from trade
unions and community councils developing from civic associations, with
distribution according to need.

Class struggle does not ignore other forms of oppression. Since the
majority of people affected by racism, sexism, homophobia and other
oppressions are working class, and these oppressions are rooted in the
capitalist system, these issues are all class issues. The class struggle
can only succeed if it consistently opposes all forms of oppression. At
the same time, the fight against special oppressions can only succeed on
the basis of class struggle, since capitalism and the State are the
primary causes of all special oppressions.[^10]

## Criticism

### Marxist-Leninist Vanguardism

Anarchists reject the Leninist concept of the vanguard party composed of
professional revolutionaries who possess correct consciousness and must
lead the working class. Anarchists see this as recreating class
hierarchy with the party becoming a new ruling class. The Leninist
emphasis on seizing state power to wield it on behalf of workers
guarantees that a new bureaucratic ruling class will emerge.

Leninism conflates working class rule with party rule over the working
class, a substitution that inevitably creates new class divisions based
on political power rather than property ownership. Actually existing
socialist states proved this analysis, showing clear class divisions
between party officials and managers who exploited ordinary workers'
labour through political rather than economic means even after
capitalist property relations were abolished.

### Economic Determinism

Some anarchists criticize overly economistic class analysis that reduces
all social relations to economic base and superstructure. While class
relations profoundly influence every aspect of society, treating
non-class oppressions as merely derivative or as automatic results of
class exploitation is both analytically flawed and strategically
harmful. Each system of oppression has its own history, dynamics, and
must be fought in its own terms while recognizing the interconnections
among all forms of domination.

### Rejection of Class Analysis

Some anarchists influenced by primitivism or post-left anarchism reject
the centrality of class analysis altogether, arguing that industrial
civilization itself is the problem or that identity-based movements have
replaced class struggle. Other critics argue that in contemporary
capitalism, traditional working class formations have dissolved or been
integrated into the system.

Class struggle anarchists respond that while capitalism constantly
changes its technology and organization, it never changes its
fundamental nature as a class system based on exploitation. The working
class has not disappeared but has been restructured and expanded
globally. Rejection of class analysis abandons strategic focus on the
group with both the greatest interest in and the greatest potential
power to overthrow capitalism.
