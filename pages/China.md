**Anarchism in China** was a significant intellectual and political
force that emerged during the late Qing dynasty and played a crucial
role in the revolutionary movements of the early 20th century. Chinese
anarchists insisted that genuine revolution could not be merely
political - replacing one government with another - but required the
complete overthrow of traditional authoritarian culture and the creation
of new social practices based on freedom, equality, and mutual aid.

## Overview

China's political history has been characterized by cycles of
centralized imperial rule, collapse, and reconstitution under new
dynasties. The current
"<a   href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China.md" class="wikilink"
title="People&#39;s Republic of China">"People's Republic of China</a>,
established in 1949 after the
"<a   href="Chinese_Communist_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Communist Revolution">"Chinese Communist Revolution</a>,
operates as a one-party authoritarian state under the
"<a   href="Chinese_Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Communist Party">"Chinese Communist Party</a>. Despite
officially claiming to represent socialism, the modern Chinese state
maintains strict hierarchical control over society, extensive
surveillance systems, and capitalist economic relations - conditions
fundamentally opposed to anarchist principles of decentralized,
voluntary association and worker self-management.

## Origins

Chinese anarchism has deep philosophical roots in
"<a   href="Taoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Taoism">"Taoism</a>, which
developed during the "<a   href="Spring_and_Autumn_period.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spring and Autumn period">"Spring and Autumn period</a> in ancient
China. Taoist sages
"<a   href="Lao_Tzu.md" class="wikilink" title="Lao Tzu">"Lao Tzu</a> and
"<a   href="Zhuang_Zhou.md" class="wikilink" title="Zhuang Zhou">"Zhuang
Zhou</a> developed philosophies based on "anti-polity" stances and
rejection of political involvement, creating a philosophy of "non-rule"
that many consider a precursor to anarchist thought.[^1] There remains
ongoing debate about whether these ancient Chinese philosophies truly
belong within the anarchist tradition.[^2]

The decline of the
"<a   href="Qing_dynasty.md" class="wikilink" title="Qing dynasty">"Qing
dynasty</a> beginning in 1839, marked by defeats in the
"<a   href="Opium_Wars.md" class="wikilink" title="Opium Wars">"Opium Wars</a>
and internal rebellions, created conditions for revolutionary ideas
including anarchism to flourish. Chinese dissidents fled abroad where
they encountered European anarchist thought and began developing
distinctly Chinese approaches to anti-authoritarian politics.

## Early Development

### Emergence of Revolutionary Thought

During the "<a   href="Self-Strengthening_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Self-Strengthening Movement">"Self-Strengthening Movement</a>,
Chinese intellectuals made direct contact with Europeans and began
questioning traditional imperial institutions. The rise of
"<a   href="Chinese_nationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese nationalism">"Chinese nationalism</a> advocating
"<a   href="popular_sovereignty.md" class="wikilink"
title="popular sovereignty">"popular sovereignty</a> was poorly received
by conservative "<a   href="Confucianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confucianists">"Confucianists</a>, leading many nationalist
thinkers toward revolutionary republicanism.

Early nationalist reformer
"<a   href="Liang_Qichao.md" class="wikilink" title="Liang Qichao">"Liang
Qichao</a> inadvertently laid foundations for anarchist thought when he
argued that nationalism "does not allow other people to infringe my
freedom, nor does it let me impose on other people" and advocated
removing all political and social restrictions from autonomous
individuals.[^3]

The collapse of reform movements and the failure of the
"<a   href="Hundred_Days&#39;_Reform.md" class="wikilink"
title="Hundred Days&#39; Reform">"Hundred Days' Reform</a> further
radicalized Chinese intellectuals, leading them toward more
revolutionary solutions.

### Introduction of Anarchist Ideas

"Anarchism" was first translated into Chinese as 無政府主義 (wúzhèngfǔ
zhǔyì), literally meaning "the doctrine of no government." The first
systematic introduction appeared in 1902 with
"<a   href="Ma_Junwu.md" class="wikilink" title="Ma Junwu">"Ma Junwu</a>'s
translation *The Great Tide in Russia*, which connected anarchism with
the "<a   href="Russian_nihilist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian nihilist movement">"Russian nihilist movement</a> and
European socialism.

## The Paris Group

Having fled China after the
"<a   href="Boxer_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink" title="Boxer Rebellion">"Boxer
Rebellion</a>,
"<a   href="Li_Shizeng.md" class="wikilink" title="Li Shizeng">"Li Shizeng</a>,
"<a   href="Zhang_Renjie.md" class="wikilink" title="Zhang Renjie">"Zhang
Renjie</a>,
"<a   href="Wu_Zhihui.md" class="wikilink" title="Wu Zhihui">"Wu Zhihui</a>,
and "<a   href="Cai_Yuanpei.md" class="wikilink" title="Cai Yuanpei">"Cai
Yuanpei</a> formed the first Chinese anarchist organization in Paris in
1906 - the World Society (世界社). After meeting French anarchist
geographer
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">"Élisée
Reclus</a>, they began analyzing China's situation through an anarchist
lens.

Unlike their comrades in the "<a   href="Tongmenghui.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Alliance">"Revolutionary Alliance</a> who sought
political revolution from above, the Paris anarchists advocated
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a> from below to completely
reorganize society. They observed that democratic and republican ideals
in Europe had been used to further capitalist interests while
impoverishing working classes, leading them to adopt fundamentally
"<a   href="anti-state.md" class="wikilink" title="anti-state">"anti-state</a>
and "<a   href="anti-capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalist">"anti-capitalist</a> positions.

### Goals and Methods

The Paris group sought abolition of authority, laws, class distinctions,
and private property, establishing humanitarianism, freedom, equality,
and communism in their place. Their methods included propaganda, mass
associations, popular resistance, and occasional assassination.

They emphasized education as fundamental to constructing anarchist
society, viewing it as both means and end of revolution. The group
established businesses including a soy products factory employing
worker-students from China, demonstrating that anarchist organizational
models based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
and cooperation were viable alternatives to capitalist enterprises.

### Publications

In 1907, the group launched
*"<a   href="Xin_Shiji.md" class="wikilink" title="Xin Shiji">"Xin Shiji</a>*
(The New Century), translating works of
"<a   href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">"William
Godwin</a>,
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a>, "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, and
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">"Élisée
Reclus</a> into Chinese. The journal operated for three years and over
one hundred issues before financial constraints forced its closure.

## The Tokyo Group

"<a   href="Liu_Shipei.md" class="wikilink" title="Liu Shipei">"Liu Shipei</a>
and "<a   href="He_Zhen_(anarchist).md" class="wikilink" title="He Zhen">"He
Zhen</a> established anarchist activities in Tokyo, founding the Society
for the Study of Socialism and promoting an anti-modernist, agrarianist
approach to anarchism. They drew heavily from ancient Chinese
philosophers, particularly
"<a   href="Laozi.md" class="wikilink" title="Laozi">"Laozi</a> whom they
considered the founding father of Chinese anarchism.

### Anarcha-Feminism

He Zhen established the
"<a   href="Women&#39;s_Rights_Recovery_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="Women&#39;s Rights Recovery Association">"Women's Rights Recovery
Association</a>, an "<a   href="anarcha-feminism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcha-feminist">"anarcha-feminist</a> organization dedicated to
implementing gender equality and ending economic exploitation of women.
In 1907, the Society began publishing
*"<a   href="Tianyi_bao.md" class="wikilink" title="Natural Justice">"Natural
Justice</a>* with objectives including destroying national boundaries,
resisting all authority, overthrowing existing governments, and
instituting absolute equality between men and women.

### Publications

The Tokyo group published *Natural Justice* and later *Balance*, which
included some of the earliest discussions on the role of peasantry in
social revolution, calling for peasants' revolution and advocating
integration of agriculture with industry.

## The Assassination Corps

Inspired by "<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">"propaganda of the deed</a>, Chinese
anarchists believed assassination undertaken through self-sacrifice
furthered the revolutionary cause.
"<a   href="Liu_Shifu.md" class="wikilink" title="Liu Shaobin">"Liu Shaobin</a>
engaged in assassination activities, including a failed attempt against
naval commander Li Zhun.

The "<a   href="Chinese_Assassination_Corps.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Assassination Corps">"Chinese Assassination Corps</a>,
influenced by groups like the Russian
"<a   href="Narodnaya_Volya.md" class="wikilink"
title="People&#39;s Will">"People's Will</a>, was particularly active in
Guangzhou during various uprisings. During the
"<a   href="Xinhai_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Xinhai Revolution">"Xinhai Revolution</a>, the Corps assassinated
Qing general "<a   href="Fengshan_(general).md" class="wikilink"
title="Fengshan">"Fengshan</a> within minutes of his arrival in the city.

## Role in the Xinhai Revolution

Chinese anarchists generally supported the republican uprisings against
the Qing dynasty, believing violence was justified for moral purposes
under despotic conditions. When revolution arrived in Guangzhou,
anarchist
"<a   href="Chen_Jiongming.md" class="wikilink" title="Chen Jiongming">"Chen
Jiongming</a> organized local militias and proclaimed the province's
independence from the Qing Empire.

Following the Revolution's success, anarchists took advantage of new
political openness to apply anarchism in practice. The Paris group
returned to China focusing on education, while Tokyo anarchists like
"<a   href="Zhang_Ji_(Republic_of_China).md" class="wikilink"
title="Zhang Ji">"Zhang Ji</a> were elected to the National Assembly,
though this political participation was criticized by other anarchists
for compromising anarchist principles.

## The Guangzhou Group and Shifu's Anarcho-Communism

After renouncing assassination, Liu Shaobin changed his name to
"<a   href="Liu_Shifu.md" class="wikilink" title="Liu Shifu">"Liu Shifu</a> and
established the Cock-Crow Society in Guangzhou, operating as a commune.
The Society propagated anarchist ideas through the journal
*"<a   href="Huiminglu.md" class="wikilink" title="People&#39;s Voice">"People's
Voice</a>* and initiated China's labor movement, becoming the first
organizers of trade unions in the country.

Shifu developed a more radical form of
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">"anarcho-communism</a> than earlier groups,
clearly distinguishing anarchism from other socialist movements. The
Guangzhou group emphasized "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a> over political
revolution, advocating abolition of politics itself.

### Society of Anarcho-Communist Comrades

The group established this society advocating "absolute freedom in
economic and political life" through abolishing capitalism and
establishing communist society without using the state. Their program
called for abolition of class distinctions, the state, marriage,
religion, and borders, while instituting common ownership of means of
production and democratic public associations.

## Decline and Suppression

### Rise of Competing Movements

By the 1920s, both the
"<a   href="Chinese_Nationalist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Nationalist Party">"Chinese Nationalist Party</a> and
"<a   href="Chinese_Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chinese Communist Party">"Chinese Communist Party</a> offered
organizational strength and political programs that drained support from
anarchists. The "<a   href="May_Thirtieth_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="May Thirtieth Movement">"May Thirtieth Movement</a> saw massive
growth in Communist Party influence, growing from one thousand to over
fifty thousand members and establishing supremacy over the Chinese labor
movement, displacing anarcho-syndicalist leadership.

### Suppression by the Kuomintang

When the
"<a   href="Kuomintang.md" class="wikilink" title="Kuomintang">"Kuomintang</a>
centralized authority and transformed China into a one-party state, they
identified anarchism as a threat to authoritarian rule. Anarchists were
forced underground as both the KMT and CCP proved hostile to
anti-authoritarians. The anarchist periodical *Revolution Weekly* was
shut down in 1929, with its final editorial stating anarchists "had
survived the Communists and the Northern Expedition" but "finally
succumbed to the Kuomintang."

## Anarchism Under Communist Rule

After 1949, many Chinese anarchists fled to
"<a   href="Hong_Kong.md" class="wikilink" title="Hong Kong">"Hong Kong</a>,
"<a   href="Taiwan.md" class="wikilink" title="Taiwan">"Taiwan</a>,
"<a   href="France.md" class="wikilink" title="France">"France</a>, or the
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">"United
States</a>, though some remained in mainland China. Those who stayed,
like writer "<a   href="Ba_Jin.md" class="wikilink" title="Ba Jin">"Ba Jin</a>,
were forced to join state organizations, had their works censored to
remove anarchist content, and largely ceased writing.

### People's Communes and Anarchic Tendencies

During the "<a   href="Great_Leap_Forward.md" class="wikilink"
title="Great Leap Forward">"Great Leap Forward</a>,
"<a   href="people&#39;s_commune.md" class="wikilink"
title="people&#39;s commune">"people's communes</a> were established with
promises of "performing functions of state power" and transitioning from
socialism to communism through
""<a   href="withering_away_of_the_state.md" class="wikilink"
title="withering away of the state">"withering away of the state</a>."
However, party officials implemented "rectification campaigns" to combat
rising egalitarianism, reasserting bureaucratic authority and
centralized state control.

### Cultural Revolution

The "<a   href="Cultural_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cultural Revolution">"Cultural Revolution</a> saw anarchistic
tendencies advocating "revolution from below" against party bureaucracy.
The "<a   href="Shanghai_People&#39;s_Commune.md" class="wikilink"
title="Shanghai People&#39;s Commune">"Shanghai People's Commune</a> was
established in 1967 with workers organizing around "All power to the
Commune," but was quickly suppressed when Mao declared such demands
"extreme anarchism" and "most reactionary."

The radical group *"<a   href="Shengwulian.md" class="wikilink"
title="Shengwulian">"Shengwulian</a>* in Hunan province called for mass
revolution to "smash the old state machinery" and establish a "People's
Commune of China" without bureaucrats. Despite pledging loyalty to Mao,
they were denounced as "anarchists" and violently suppressed.

## Contemporary Developments

### Democracy Movement

The "<a   href="Democracy_movements_in_China.md" class="wikilink"
title="Democracy Movement">"Democracy Movement</a> of the late 1970s
revived anti-bureaucratic ideals, but Deng Xiaoping denounced
participants as anarchists and implemented severe repression, arresting
leaders like
"<a   href="Wei_Jingsheng.md" class="wikilink" title="Wei Jingsheng">"Wei
Jingsheng</a>.

### Underground Anarchist Activity

In the early 21st century, Chinese punk subculture emerged in
"<a   href="Wuhan.md" class="wikilink" title="Wuhan">"Wuhan</a>, developing
anarchist tendencies and concepts of
"<a   href="anti-authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarianism">"anti-authoritarianism</a>,
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a>, and
"<a   href="anti-globalization.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-globalization">"anti-globalization</a>. The scene produced
*Chaos* magazine, the first anarchist publication in mainland China
since 1949, featuring articles on
"<a   href="Situationists.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationists">"Situationists</a>,
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchism">"green
anarchism</a>, and translations of
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> and "<a   href="CrimethInc..md" class="wikilink"
title="CrimethInc.">"CrimethInc.</a>

Anarcho-punks established an
"<a   href="autonomous_social_center.md" class="wikilink"
title="autonomous social center">"autonomous social center</a> called
"Our Home" containing an infoshop, conference center, and concert space,
though it was eventually shut down due to state pressure.

## Analysis

Chinese anarchism represented a genuine attempt to create alternatives
to both imperial authoritarianism and emerging state socialist models.
Unlike Western anarchism, Chinese variants often emphasized education
and cultural transformation over direct confrontation, while maintaining
strong commitments to gender equality and worker self-organization.

The movement's decline resulted from state repression by both
nationalist and communist governments, which viewed anarchist principles
of decentralized, voluntary association as threats to centralized party
control. The Chinese experience demonstrates both the appeal of
anarchist ideas during periods of social upheaval and the systematic
violence states employ to eliminate anti-authoritarian alternatives.
