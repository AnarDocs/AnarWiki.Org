## Positives and Negatives

The socialist left is divided into two camps, a pro-USSR camp and an
anti-USSR camp. The pro-USSR camp is dominated by Marxist-Leninists and
other authoritarian socialists, whilst libertarian socialists tend to
dominate the anti-USSR camp. However, we must accept facts and
acknowledge the many good and bad things done by the USSR.

### Positives

- The USSR increased life expectancy from 43 years to 68 years from 1927
  to 1989. This becomes notable after life expectancy dropped 6 years
  after the collapse of the USSR.
- The USSR massively expanded women's rights.
- Industrialise faster than any other society in history in the midst of
  the <a href="Great_Depression" class="wikilink"
  title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> without trading with
  other countries.
- The USSR made several massive advances in science, notably putting the
  first object, animal and
  person<a href="Space_Exploration" class="wikilink" title="into space">into
  space</a>. Some notable achievements include:
  - AK-47
  - Blood Bank
  - Jet Packs
  - Modern Helicopters
  - <a href="Nuclear_Energy" class="wikilink"
    title="Nuclear Power Plant">Nuclear Power Plant</a>
  - Postal Codes
  - RPG-7
  - <a href="Space_Exploration" class="wikilink"
    title="Space Exploration">Space Exploration</a>
  - Space Rover
  - Space Stations
  - Space Suit
  - Stem Cells
  - Supersonic Aircraft
- The USSR also made several large cultural advancements, including:
  - Film Schools
  - Miniature Railways
  - Montage in Movies
  - Tetris
- Almost eliminating <a href="unemployment" class="wikilink"
  title="unemployment">unemployment</a>.
- During
  <a href="World_War_II" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
  II</a>, the USSR managed to inflict the most damage on
  <a href="Nazi_Germany" class="wikilink" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi
  Germany</a>, it's been estimated that 8/10 German deaths in the war
  were against the USSR.
- From 1927 to 1941, the USSR expanded their freight rail network to be
  20x larger than before, surpassing the US. From 1965 to 1980, the USSR
  build 639km of track a year (or about 1.5km a day).

## Major Social Struggles

Note: All of these took place after the seizure of power by Khrushchev
and his revisionist clique and restoration of capitalism in 1956, and
thus do not represent the socialist USSR under Stalin and the
Bolsheviks.

- 1963: Moscow Protests by African Students
- 1964: Moroccan Embassy in Moscow Sit-In

  title="Red Square Anti-War Protests">Red Square Anti-War Protests</a>
- 1972: Kaunas' Spring
- 1987: Phosphorite War

## Negatives

- A lot of indiscriminate killing and sexual violence.
- Repression of various democratic movements:
  - During the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks crushed the
    <a href="Free_Territory_of_Ukraine" class="wikilink"
    title="Free Territory of Ukraine">Free Territory of Ukraine</a> and
    <a href="Kronstadt_Rebellion" class="wikilink"
    title="Kronstadt Rebellion">Kronstadt Rebellion</a>, as well as
    numerous other peasant movements and Russia's urban anarchist
    movement. Although the USSR isn't technically responsible, it was
    built on the graves of the libertarian left and shared the same
    ancestor (Lenin).
  - During the 1950s, the USSR sent soldiers into other Warsaw Pact
    countries like Hungary, Poland and East Germany to stop democratic
    revolutions.
- Generating 1.5x as much air pollution and carbon emissions as the USA
  in 1988 per unit of GNP.[^1]
- Creating some of the largest <a href="Ecocide" class="wikilink"
  title="ecological disasters">ecological disasters</a> in history:
  - Most famously, the
    <a href="Chernobyl_Nuclear_Disaster" class="wikilink"
    title="Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster">Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster</a>,
    considered the worst <a href="Nuclear_Energy" class="wikilink"
    title="nuclear accident">nuclear accident</a> in history. Having
    killed 42 people and led to the government creating a 2,600km
    exclusion zone that has been closed for 33 years. Despite this,
    scientific teams, tourists and smugglers still enter the area
    frequently.[^2]
  - The
    <a href="Aral_Sea" class="wikilink" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a>
    between what is now
    <a href="Kazakhstan" class="wikilink" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>
    and
    <a href="Uzbekistan" class="wikilink" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>,
    once the fourth largest lake in the world, had dried up thanks to
    the USSR using it for drainage. But it's also now covered in toxic
    salt flats as a result of weapons testing, industrial projects, and
    pesticides and fertilizer runoff. This has led to toxic dust storms
    and a lack of fresh water for the local population leading to
    massive health problems and high rates of cancer. Additionally, the
    loss of the Aral Sea has generated local
    <a href="Climate_Change" class="wikilink" title="climate change">climate
    change</a> in the form of cooler winters and hotter summers. Former
    fishing towns have declined, surrounded by abandoned ship
    graveyards.[^3]
  - The Techa River in the Ural Mountains
    (<a href="Russia" class="wikilink" title="Russia">Russia</a>) saw
    76 million cubic metres (roughly over 30,000 olympic sized swimming
    pools) of radioactive waste water dumped into by the Mayak complex
    despite 28,000 people living along the villages. An estimated half a
    million people were irradiated with potentially 20 times the
    radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster victims, and its worth
    noting the river connects to the Arctic Ocean, meaning the worlds
    oceans were potentially contaminated with nuclear waste.[^4]
    - The Mayak complex also triggered the
      <a href="Kyshtym_Disaster" class="wikilink"
      title="Kyshtym Disaster">Kyshtym Disaster</a> (radioactive clouds
      spread over 52,000 square km where at least 270,000 people lived
      across Russia, considered the third worst nuclear accident in
      history after
      <a href="Fukishima_Nuclear_Disaster" class="wikilink"
      title="Fukishima">Fukishima</a> and Chernobyl)[^5] and the
      Pollution of Lake Karachay, having so much radioactive waste
      dumped into it is considered the most polluted place on Earth (and
      lacks warning signs on the surrounding roads, meaning anyone could
      stumble in). By the time Mayak's existence was officially
      recognized in 1992, there had been a 21% rise in cancer cases, a
      25% rise in birth defects, and a 41% rise in leukemia in the
      surrounding region.[^6] This case is very interesting, [here is a
      15-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQCfOjhguO0)
      explaining it.
  - The collapse of the Mailuu-Suu tailings dam (dams to hold in waste
    at mines) led to the release of 600,000 cubic metres of radioactive
    waste. Several were killed instantly and the site remains a health
    hazard, being the most polluted site in Kyrgyzstan and one of the
    top 10 most polluted sites in the world.[^7]
