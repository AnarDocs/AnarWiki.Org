# Islamic Anarchism

**Islamic Anarchism** refers to anarchist thought and practice emerging
from or engaging with Islamic tradition. While seemingly
paradoxical—given that Islam means "submission" in Arabic—various
currents throughout Islamic history have challenged centralized
authority, advocated for statelessness, or developed egalitarian
interpretations of Islamic law that reject hierarchical governance.[^1]

## Origins

### Early Islamic Anarchism

The earliest examples of anarchist tendencies within Islam emerged among
the **Kharijites** (Khawarij), particularly the **Najdat** (Najdiyya)
subsect. The Kharijites arose in the 7th century as opponents of both
Sunni and Shia authority structures, challenging Caliph Ali's attempt at
arbitration with Muawiyah. Declaring "Let God be the judge," they
rejected human political authority in favor of direct divine
judgment.[^2]

The Najdat Kharijites went further than other Kharijite groups by
arguing that if no suitable imam (leader) existed within the community,
the position could be dispensed with entirely.[^3] They maintained that
an imam required unanimous community agreement to be legitimate, but
since such perfect consensus was impossible—even the first caliph Abu
Bakr had faced opposition—no true imamate had ever existed. Therefore,
Muslims were not obligated to establish one.[^4]

Within Najdite thought, all believers possessed equal authority to
interpret religious law through *ijtihad* (independent reasoning). They
described believers as "like the teeth of a comb" or "like a hundred
male camels without a single female riding camel among them"—emphasizing
radical equality and rejecting any master apart from God.[^5] This
constituted what scholar Patricia Crone termed a "do-it-yourself
religion" characterized by both political and intellectual autonomy.[^6]

### Mu'tazilite Anarchists

A more sophisticated anarchist tradition emerged among ninth-century
**Mu'tazilites** in Basra, Iraq. Several prominent Mu'tazilite
theologians developed arguments against the necessity of the imamate,
including:

- **Al-Asamm** (d. 816-817) argued that since the Muslim community had
  grown too large for genuine consensus, legitimate imamate was
  impossible. He advocated for federation of semi-independent provincial
  leaders or government by executive committee.[^7]

<!-- -->

- **Al-Nazzam** (d. 835-845) famously declared that people would not
  need an imam if they obeyed the law voluntarily, demonstrating that
  the imamate was not rationally obligatory.[^8]

<!-- -->

- **Hisham al-Fuwati** (d. 840s) and his pupil **Abbad ibn Sulayman**
  (d. 870s) argued the community could only elect an imam when unanimous
  and righteous—conditions no longer possible. 'Abbad categorically
  stated no imam could ever exist again.[^9]

<!-- -->

- The **Mu'tazilite ascetics** (sufiyyat al-mu'tazila) argued that since
  imams inevitably degenerated into tyrannical kings, and civil war to
  depose them caused more harm than good, the best solution was not to
  establish them in the first place.[^10]

These thinkers desacralized the imamate by arguing it was not prescribed
by religious law—not mentioned in the Quran, not clearly mandated by the
Prophet, and therefore merely a human convention (*min mu'amalat
al-nas*) that could be dispensed with.[^11]

## Historical Context

### Medieval Islamic World

By the 9th century, the Abbasid Caliphate had transformed from the
simple community of early Medina into a vast centralized empire. The
imamate had become, as critics said, kingship—meaning tyranny. Muslim
political thinkers faced a dilemma between activist rebellion (advocated
by most Mu'tazilites and Kharijites), quietist submission (advocated by
Sunni scholars), or the anarchist alternative of rejecting centralized
authority altogether.[^12]

The anarchists proposed various alternatives to the caliphate:

- **Temporary imams** elected for specific tasks (dispute resolution,
  defense) who would lose authority once finished
- **Executive committees** of trustworthy individuals to apply law and
  dispense penalties
- **Federation** of semi-independent provincial leaders
- **Self-help** and voluntary cooperation among households, districts,
  and tribes
- **Devolution** to patriarchs and local community leaders[^13]

A brief opportunity for practical implementation arose in 817 when
government collapsed in Baghdad following civil war. The Mu'tazilite
Sahl ibn Salama organized effective vigilante groups that maintained
order through voluntary cooperation, demonstrating to anarchists that
decentralized organization was viable.[^14]

### Sufi Antinomianism

Mystical currents within Islam also manifested anarchist tendencies.
Various **dervish groups** in the medieval period rejected religious and
social norms, including the **Qalandariyya** and **Madariyya** who
practiced voluntary poverty, nomadism, and systematic violation of
Islamic law to demonstrate rejection of conventional authority.[^15]
Scholar Ahmet Karamustafa characterized their practice as "individualist
anarchism" and "active nihilism targeted directly at society."[^16]

The 13th-century mystic **Ibn Arabi** exemplified Islamic mysticism's
challenge to authority through personal revelation and the teaching that
"if men knew themselves, they would know God"—bypassing clerical
intermediation.[^17]

## Modern Islamic Anarchism

### Early Modern Period

Interaction between European anarchists and Muslim societies intensified
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Alexandria, Egypt, Italian
anarchists organized a branch of the International Workers Association
by 1876. In the early 1880s, **Errico Malatesta** and other Italian
anarchists joined the Urabi uprising against British colonialism—perhaps
the first time Muslims and anarchists fought a military campaign
together.[^18]

In 1901, anarchists co-founded the Université Populaire Libre in
Alexandria, offering free courses on anarchist theory, arts, and
practical skills in French, Italian, and Arabic. Though it attracted
15,000 people in its first two years, indigenous Muslims were gradually
marginalized.[^19]

### Notable Figures

Several Western converts to Islam explicitly combined anarchist and
Islamic identities:

**Ivan Aguéli** (1869-1917), born John Gustaf Agelii in Sweden,
converted to Islam by 1897 after encountering anarchist philosopher
Peter Kropotkin in 1891. Though he usually wrote about Islam and
anarchism separately, he advocated syndicalism and declared "My
fatherland is the universe" after shooting a matador in protest against
animal abuse.[^20]

**Isabelle Eberhardt** (1877-1904), born in Geneva to a Russian
anarchist family, converted to Islam around 1896-97, took the male name
Si Mahmoud Saadi, and lived nomadically in Algeria. In her 1900 article
"Age of the Void," she articulated an anarcho-primitivist critique:
"Civilization, that great fraud of our times, has promised man that by
complicating his existence it would multiply his pleasures... The
superfluous has become a necessity and luxuries are indispensable."[^21]

**Gustave-Henri Jossot** (1866-1951), French cartoonist who contributed
to anarchist magazine *L'Assiette au Beurre*, converted to Islam in
1913, taking the name Abdul Karim. He cited "simplicity, no priests, no
dogmas and almost no ceremonies" as reasons for conversion and became a
disciple of Sufi Sheikh Ahmed al-Alawi. He described Islam as "the most
rational of all religions."[^22]

**Leda Rafanelli** (1880-1971), Italian anarchist who converted to Islam
during her time in Alexandria, Egypt, took the Arabic name Djali
(meaning "of myself"). She combined anarchist activism with Islamic
faith throughout her life, though she kept her religious practice
largely private. She published the novel *L'oasi* (1929) denouncing
colonialism.[^23]

### Contemporary Developments

Modern Islamic anarchism has taken various forms:

**Ali Shariati** (1933-1977), though not explicitly anarchist, developed
revolutionary Islamic theology arguing that the only true reflection of
*Tawhid* (unity of God) is a classless society. He influenced the
Iranian Revolution before being imprisoned, forced into exile, and
assassinated.[^24][^25]

**Peter Lamborn Wilson** (b. 1945), writing as **Hakim Bey**, combined
Sufism with anarchist theory in works like *T.A.Z.: The Temporary
Autonomous Zone* (1991). He drew on Islamic heretical traditions and
pirate enclaves to theorize spaces of temporary liberation from state
power.[^26]

**Abdennur Prado** (Spain) authored *El Islam como Anarquismo Místico*
(Islam as Mystical Anarchism), arguing the Prophet's original community
exemplified anarchist organization.[^27]

**Mohamed Jean Veneuse** (Canada) wrote *Anarca-Islam*, developing
"Anarchic-Ijtihad" based on Islamic concepts like *ijma* (consensus),
*shura* (consultation), and *maslaha* (public interest) to describe
democratic, egalitarian currents within Islam. He also interpreted the
ban on *riba* (usury) as anti-capitalist.[^28]

In 2003, the **Asociación Islámica-Libertaria Internacional** (AILI)
formed in Spain as an anarcho-syndicalist Muslim organization.[^29]

The 2011 Arab Spring saw anarchist methods employed in Tahrir Square,
Egypt, though participants pursued liberal rather than anarchist goals.
Sociologist Mohammed Bamyeh noted: "the revolutionary style is
anarchist, in the sense that it requires little organization,
leadership, or even coordination... relies on spontaneity, minimal
planning, local initiative, and individual will."[^30]

## Theoretical Foundations

### Islamic Justifications

Islamic anarchists draw on several Islamic principles:

- **Tawhid** (Unity of God) - Interpreted to mean God alone deserves
  sovereignty, making human rulership illegitimate

The Quranic concept of Tawhid implicitly and explicitly means that the
deification of any other besides God—be it through pledging allegiance
to an authority figure or that of any nation-state, a flag, the worship
of one's tribal allegiances, or even the longing for prestige and
wealth—is forbidden and referred to as shirk (polytheism). This is the
strongest argument: if only God has sovereignty, then human hierarchies
and state authority are inherently illegitimate usurpations of divine
authority.

- **Ijma** (Consensus) - Democratic decision-making in the community
- **Shura** (Consultation) - Participatory deliberation
- **Ijtihad** (Independent reasoning) - Individual interpretation of
  religious law
- **Maslaha** (Public interest) - Welfare-based legal reasoning
- **Anti-riba** (Opposition to usury/interest) - Economic justice[^31]

#### Key Quranic Verses

Key Quranic verses cited include:

"There shall be no compulsion in religion" (Quran 2:256)[^32]

"If you were to obey a human being like yourselves, then verily you
indeed would be losers" (Quran 23:34)[^33]

#### Property Belongs to God

Verse 10 of Surah Yunus states "whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is in the earth belongs to Allah," which Islamic anarchists interpret as
meaning true ownership belongs only to God, and humans are merely
trustees. This resonates with anarchism's critique of private property.

#### The Direct Relationship with God

Islamic anarchists argue that the fundamental principle of Islam, which
emphasizes the direct relationship between God and the servant, has
established a remarkable connection with anarchist tendencies, and the
questioning of the legitimacy of clergy and rejection of intermediaries
prepared the ground for a stance opposing authority MDPI. This mirrors
the Protestant "priesthood of all believers" concept - no human
intermediaries needed.

### Anarchist Critiques of Islam

Western anarchists have historically critiqued aspects of Islamic
societies, particularly regarding:

- Perceived coercion of women through dress codes and legal restrictions
- Criminalization and persecution of homosexuality
- Treatment of apostates and non-Muslims
- Implementation of Sharia law with corporal punishment
- The concept of Jihad as religious warfare[^34]

However, liberal Muslims and Islamic anarchists respond that many of
these issues reflect regional customs, authoritarian state practice, or
orthodox interpretations rather than essential Islamic principles. They
emphasize Islam's emphasis on self-realization through *ijtihad* and
argue for complete gender equality, acceptance of diverse sexualities,
and rejection of Sharia as state law.[^35]

## Characteristics

Islamic anarchism differs from Western anarchism in several respects:

- It emerged from concerns about political legitimacy rather than from
  ideas about natural freedom or the state of nature
- It focused on desacralizing state authority while maintaining
  religious law as society's foundation
- It generally did not advocate social or economic revolution beyond
  political decentralization
- It accepted hierarchy in family and local structures while rejecting
  centralized state power
- It emphasized moral duty and cooperation rather than individual
  liberty alone[^36]

Unlike Western anarchism's typical combination of anti-statism with
economic egalitarianism and social reorganization, Islamic anarchism
primarily addressed questions of political authority and religious
interpretation, accepting existing social structures while seeking to
remove tyrannical central government.[^37]

## Decline and Legacy

Both Mu'tazilite and Najdite anarchism disappeared by the 10th century.
The Abbasid Caliphate fragmented into semi-independent provinces, but
under military rulers who became "miniature versions of the caliph the
tyrant." By the 12th century, Islamic political thought had thoroughly
accepted monarchy, with texts declaring kings must ensure subjects "do
not take out the ring of slavery from their ears."[^38]

Patricia Crone notes: "Of people contemplating life without monarchs on
a permanent basis in the Islamic world I do not know a single
unambiguous example after the Mu'tazilite and Najdite anarchists had
disappeared."[^39]

The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw renewed interest in Islamic
anarchism, particularly following the failures of both nationalist and
Islamist political projects in the Muslim world. Contemporary Islamic
anarchists draw inspiration from historical examples while developing
new syntheses appropriate to modern contexts.

## Criticism

Some scholars question whether attempts to combine Islam and anarchism
are coherent. The apparent contradiction between Islam's emphasis on
submission to divine law and anarchism's rejection of authority has led
critics to suggest Islamic anarchists compartmentalize their beliefs
rather than successfully integrating them.[^40]

Others note that historical Islamic "anarchists" often excluded
outsiders from their egalitarian vision—the Najdiyya regarded all
non-Najdites as infidels who could be enslaved or killed, limiting their
anarchism to a tiny in-group.[^41]

Some contemporary anarchists, such as Murray Bookchin, have criticized
mystical and religious forms of anarchism as promoting irrationalism and
lifestyle politics rather than genuine social transformation.[^42]
