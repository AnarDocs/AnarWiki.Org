# Left Unity

## Overview

Left Unity refers to strategic cooperation and alliance-building between
different socialist and leftist tendencies in pursuit of shared goals.
The concept has been debated within anarchist circles since the late
19th century, with anarchists divided over whether cooperation with
non-anarchist leftists serves the cause of liberation or undermines
anarchist principles.

Many anarchists consider themselves socialists who want workers to make
choices over their work and production for need rather than profit,
placing them within the broader left political spectrum.[^1] Similarly,
many anarchists identify as communists, seeking a classless, stateless,
moneyless society based on communal living and mutual aid.

However, not all who call themselves socialists are anarchists. Some
socialists believe in working through state apparatus, elections,
politicians, policies and laws as a path to achieving socialism. While
anarchists have sometimes worked with such socialists on social and
workers' issues and helped make concessions, they remain skeptical that
government can guarantee freedoms and benefits, as the state that grants
rights can just as easily dismantle them.[^2]

The question of left unity has produced particularly sharp debate
regarding "<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Leninists">Leninists</a> and
"<a   href="Maoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Maoists">Maoists</a>, who
believe authoritarian governments and party dictatorships can lead to
socialism or communism. History has repeatedly shown this leads to a
form of "<a   href="fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="fascism">fascism</a>,
replacing private
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
with "<a   href="state_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a>, enslaving workers under
new masters, and substituting one empire for another equally or more
restrictive and violent.[^3]

## Historical Context

### Early Debates

The question of anarchist cooperation with other leftist tendencies
emerged prominently in the late 19th century. In 1890, two anarchist
writers published contrasting views in *Twentieth Century* magazine that
exemplified the debate's enduring tensions.

"<a   href="William_Holmes.md" class="wikilink" title="William Holmes">William
Holmes</a> argued that anarchists should assist in creating and
nourishing "a spirit of discontent" regardless of specific remedies
proposed, believing that "there is good in all things, that there are
truths in every doctrine."[^4] He advocated distributing literature from
"<a   href="State_Socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="State Socialists">State Socialists</a>,
"<a   href="Nationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nationalists">Nationalists</a>, and
"<a   href="Single_Tax.md" class="wikilink" title="Single Tax">Single Tax</a>
advocates, arguing these works could awaken people to social injustices
even if their proposed solutions were flawed.

"<a   href="Victor_Yarros.md" class="wikilink" title="Victor Yarros">Victor
Yarros</a> countered that cooperation was impossible due to fundamental
theoretical differences: "My ideal is a totally different one from that
of the Nationalists, alias Socialists; my methods are also different.
Hence I cannot work with them."[^5] He emphasized that practice without
theory is impossible in social affairs, and that differing theories
necessitate different practices.

"<a   href="Ross_Winn.md" class="wikilink" title="Ross Winn">Ross Winn</a>
offered a middle position in 1894, arguing that while reformers differed
on methods, they shared the goal of a
"<a   href="cooperative_commonwealth.md" class="wikilink"
title="cooperative commonwealth">cooperative commonwealth</a>. He
proposed that unity could be achieved on the basis of
"<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">voluntary association</a>: "Let us have
the co-operative commonwealth. It is sure to come, but let its
foundation be individual freedom."[^6]

### 20th Century Revolutionary Movements

The early 20th century saw anarchists and
"<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxists">Marxists</a> unite
during several revolutionary moments.
"<a   href="The_First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="The First International">The First International</a> initially
brought anarchists and Marxists together until
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
organized the expulsion of "<a   href="Michael_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Michael Bakunin">Michael Bakunin</a> and forced a split with the
anarchists.[^7]

The "<a   href="Haymarket_Affair.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Martyrs">Haymarket Martyrs</a> of 1886 were anarchists
who came from Marxist backgrounds and continued using Marxist analysis
of capitalism.[^8] "<a   href="Anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a> shared a
revolutionary working class orientation with Marxism, creating
opportunities for cooperation in labor struggles.

## Frameworks for Collaboration

### The United Front

The
**"<a   href="United_Front.md" class="wikilink" title="United Front">United
Front</a>** was theorized in the early 1920s by the
"<a   href="Comintern.md" class="wikilink" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> and
developed by
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a>. Almost simultaneously, a similar model was articulated by
Italian anarchists
"<a   href="Armando_Borghi.md" class="wikilink" title="Armando Borghi">Armando
Borghi</a> and "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>.[^9]

In basic terms, the United Front suggests revolutionary proletarian
organizations should form tactical and strategic alliances with
reformist proletarian organizations, such as
"<a   href="social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democrats">social democrats</a>. In its defensive form, it
is a strategy for when radical forces are in a minority.[^10]
Revolutionary organizations maintain independence while working with
reformists on concrete shared goals. When reformists falter or betray
the struggle, revolutionaries can point out these failings and
potentially win over rank-and-file members.

#### Italy and Anti-Fascism

In 1921, as Italian
"<a   href="fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="fascism">fascism</a> emerged,
Malatesta proposed the *Fronte Unico Rivoluzionario* (Revolutionary
United Front) as a defensive anti-fascist alliance.[^11] Italian workers
initially formed Workers Defence Committees, uniting proletarians at the
rank-and-file level to meet fascist attacks. These committees joined
with left-wing ex-servicemen to establish the anti-fascist militia, the
Arditi del Popolo.[^12]

Tragically, both the "<a   href="Socialist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist Party">Socialist Party</a> and
"<a   href="Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a> withdrew from the Arditi,
leaving anarchists, "<a   href="syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalists">syndicalists</a>, and republicans to fight fascism
alone. Trotsky later articulated the anti-fascist United Front in the
1930s, arguing that German workers' organizations must unite for mass
action against fascism.[^13]

### The Workers Alliance

In 1934, the mining region of
"<a   href="Asturias.md" class="wikilink" title="Asturias">Asturias</a> in
"<a   href="Spain.md" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a> erupted in
revolt following a fascist organization joining the government. This was
precipitated by the **Alianza Obrera** (Workers Alliance), a
revolutionary coalition initially formed by the anarcho-syndicalist
union "<a   href="CNT.md" class="wikilink" title="CNT">CNT</a>, the
socialist-dominated "<a   href="UGT.md" class="wikilink" title="UGT">UGT</a>,
later joined by the
"<a   href="PSOE.md" class="wikilink" title="PSOE">PSOE</a>,
"<a   href="BOC.md" class="wikilink" title="BOC">BOC</a>, Communist Left, and
Communist Party.[^14]

In Asturias, the rank-and-file of the socialist movement was more
left-wing than elsewhere, and the local CNT federation sought unity with
fellow workers for revolutionary aspirations. The Asturian syndicalists
believed workers could unite on the basis of their economic position and
around workers' democracy rather than political loyalties, reflecting
the anarcho-syndicalist anti-political attitude.[^15]

However, national tensions between political forces undermined a
country-wide Workers Alliance. The
"<a   href="FAI.md" class="wikilink" title="FAI">FAI</a> was particularly
hostile to the alliance. When the revolt erupted, the alliance failed in
every region except Asturias. Though most of the country went on general
strike, Asturias fought alone for a fortnight, establishing proletarian
self-governance until crushed by the military.[^16]

The experience revealed both the potential and limitations of workers'
alliances. The naive belief that workers could unite purely on their
proletarian existence, collapsing social and political levels, proved
problematic. Yet the Asturian syndicalists were correct that working
alongside socialist workers in action could win them over to
revolutionary perspectives.[^17]

### Uruguay and the Combative Tendency

The **"<a   href="Federación_Anarquista_Uruguaya.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federación Anarquista Uruguaya">Federación Anarquista
Uruguaya</a>** (FAU) developed unique approaches to coalition-building
during the 1960s and 70s. They helped form a new national union body
comprising over 90% of unionized workers. Within this
"<a   href="CNT_(Uruguay).md" class="wikilink" title="CNT">CNT</a>, the FAU
organized with militant Marxist groups like the
"<a   href="MLN-Tupamaros.md" class="wikilink"
title="MLN-Tupamaros">MLN-Tupamaros</a> to create the **Combativa
Tendencia** (Combative Tendency) voting block.[^18]

While the "<a   href="Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a> attempted to push movements
toward their electoral project, the Frente Amplio, the FAU and Tendencia
grew in the vacuum left by CP leadership in the labor movement. As an
internal FAU document noted: "in the end.. what matters… is who
organises and practically leads the struggle. Not who has the majority
at congresses."[^19]

The FAU's **Las Dos Patos** (Two Feet) strategy included a mass
organization, Resistencia Obrero Estudiantil (ROE), which integrated
over ten thousand people from across the far left. The ROE allowed the
FAU to function above ground when illegal, united broader social groups
behind labor conflicts, and allowed different radical groups the ability
to "strike together."[^20]

### The Grouping of Tendency

Some
"<a   href="especifismo.md" class="wikilink" title="especifist">especifist</a>
anarchists developed the **Grouping of Tendency** model to frame
intervention into movements and struggles. This operates at both social
movement and political struggle levels, with clear distinction between
social and political levels allowing concrete analysis of what alliances
can be made and where.[^21]

In any coalition gathered to achieve a particular aim, anarchists
attempt to establish an intermediate form of organization based on
coherent definitions of practice and ideological affinities. Before
establishing a Grouping of Tendency, organizations study material
conditions and prospects of achieving goals to assure it is the right
strategic choice.[^22]

## Arguments in Favor

### Common Ground

Proponents of left unity argue that different leftist tendencies share
significant common ground that justifies cooperation. State Socialists,
Nationalists, and Anarchists all desire the abolition of
"<a   href="interest.md" class="wikilink" title="interest">interest</a> and
"<a   href="profit.md" class="wikilink" title="profit">profit</a>, though
through different means.[^23] Nationalists, Single-tax advocates, and
State Socialists unite in declaring that government should be less
cumbersome and costly, and all advocate for more individual
freedom.[^24]

The common impulse moving these groups is to abolish present systems and
conditions. As Holmes argued: "In this consideration of the common
objects of a part or all of these schools, I find an excuse for making
common cause with all of them."[^25]

### Creating Discontent

Holmes emphasized the value of works that "stir up thought" regardless
of their specific proposals. Books like Henry George's "Social Problems"
and Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward," while not anarchist, awaken
thousands to the true condition of society and create shame at wrongs
committed against humanity.[^26]

"Show me a work depicting the hypocrisy, the fraud, the rottenness, and
the awful barbarities fostered and practiced under the present system,"
Holmes wrote, "and I care not what plan or method is suggested as a
remedy, I will do my utmost to increase its circulation."[^27]

### Evolutionary Progress

Some anarchists view cooperation with other tendencies as part of
natural social evolution. Holmes argued: "I know that the direction of
progress is, as Spencer puts it, through successive differentiations
from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous."[^28] He suggested society
might pass through various forms before reaching anarchism, and that
each step represents natural progress toward liberty.

### Working Class Unity

Rather than abstract "left unity," some anarchists propose building a
**working class front** based on unions, community-based movements, left
groups, and cooperatives that can cooperate around specific campaigns
and demands.[^29]

These movements should be internally democratic and politically
pluralist, where different left groups cooperate and engage mass
movements. No group surrenders political independence in the name of
unity, but all can cooperate on specific issues. The idea is not to
create a party for the working class, but to unite working class
formations while encouraging difference and debate.[^30]

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Theoretical Incompatibility

Critics argue that fundamental theoretical differences make meaningful
left unity impossible. As Yarros stated: "I have my own ideal; I have
definite views respecting the mode of its gradual realization; and I
follow my own lights."[^31]

Anarchism's analysis of the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> as a
fundamental site of minority class rule creates irreconcilable
differences with Marxists and social democrats who seek to capture state
power.[^32] Anarchism's insistence on democratic collective
self-reliance and individual freedom within cooperative communal society
stands opposed to the state and party-centered approach dominating
Marxism.[^33]

### Historical Betrayals

Anarchists point to repeated historical betrayals by supposed allies.
The "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> initially saw
convergence between anarchists and Marxist revolutionaries, but by 1920,
the "<a   href="Leninism.md" class="wikilink" title="Leninists">Leninists</a>
had banned all alternate parties, including those that fought on their
side. Anarchists were arrested, jailed, and shot.[^34]

The "<a   href="Kronstadt_rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a> of 1921 exemplified
this pattern. Sailors influenced by anarchists demanded an end to the
Communist political monopoly and free elections to
"<a   href="soviets.md" class="wikilink" title="soviets">soviets</a>. The
Communists crushed them militarily and shot captured sailors in
batches.[^35]

During the "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, the
"<a   href="Popular_Front.md" class="wikilink" title="Popular Front">Popular
Front</a> strategy proved disastrous. The rolling back of
"<a   href="collectivization.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivization">collectivization</a> crippled both morale and
the economy, and bourgeois forces took advantage of the alliance to
smash working class forces.[^36] As the journal *Bilan* noted, the
Spanish Revolution was ultimately defeated under the slogan of
Anti-Fascism.[^37]

### Entryism and Manipulation

Contemporary critics describe
**"<a   href="entryism.md" class="wikilink" title="entryism">entryism</a>**
whereby members of authoritarian groups join anarchist spaces with the
intention of changing principles and plans. This provides "a means for a
small but determined group to leverage their influence onto a larger
sphere by using an infiltrated group's resources."[^38]

The process typically involves:

1.  Infiltration through appeals to inclusivity and accusations of
    sectarianism
2.  Establishing "left-unity" policies that ban criticism of
    authoritarian views
3.  Purging vocal opponents for "breaking left-unity"
4.  Flooding spaces with authoritarian propaganda and theory
5.  Normalizing gulags, dictators, and genocide through memes and
    discourse
6.  Shaming and ridiculing anyone breaking with party lines[^39]

As one critic describes: "'Left-unity' has never been anything more than
tankie doublespeak for 'obey us or be purged'. Don't fall for it."[^40]

### Silencing Critical Voices

"Unity" is often weaponized to silence people critical of harm. Demands
for unity may come from those who refuse to interrogate how their
behaviors and ideology are complicit with systems of oppression.[^41]

Unity cannot meaningfully exist where power imbalances aren't
recognized, harm is unaddressed, and building and healing are not mutual
investments. Without shared intentions to move forward and cultivate
transparent, caring relationships, "unity" is merely an illusion.[^42]

### Hierarchy and Authority

Anti-authoritarians cannot be expected to uncritically build with groups
fundamentally defined by
"<a   href="hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a> or
willing to collude with and become the state apparatus. Practicing
"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a> means
actively contesting milieus that refuse criticism of harm caused by
their structure, practices, and leaders.[^43]

When spaces refuse to consider horizontal organizing, they resign
themselves to the assumption that work isn't possible unless levels of
leadership are created and enforced. Multi-tendency organizing often
results in those prioritizing leadership and hierarchy moving to assert
their demands, appointing themselves to power positions and demanding
everyone abide by their party line.[^44]

### The Popular Front

The
**"<a   href="Popular_Front.md" class="wikilink" title="Popular Front">Popular
Front</a>** strategy, whereby revolutionary organizations subordinate
themselves to coalitions with progressive bourgeois forces, has been
particularly criticized. The Comintern's turn to Popular Front in the
1930s reflected Soviet national interests over international
revolution.[^45]

In Spain, the Popular Front brought revolution under Soviet thumb.
Support in weapons was conditional on rolling back revolutionary
aspirations. Collectivization was abandoned to "win the war" by
attracting foreign bourgeois support, but democratic nations did not
support the Republic, and bourgeois forces took advantage to smash
working class forces.[^46]

Since Spain, the Popular Front strategy has led to largely disastrous
results during World War II, National Liberation Struggles, and
Allende's government in 1973 Chile.[^47]

### Third Positionism

Critics identify concerning overlaps between contemporary forms of
Marxism-Leninism and **"<a   href="third_position.md" class="wikilink"
title="third positionism">third positionism</a>** - the fascist ideology
blending right-wing cultural views with left-wing economic
rhetoric.[^48]

Modern defenders of states like China, which combines privatization,
free markets, landlords, stock exchanges, billionaires,
ethno-nationalism, cultural genocide, and mass incarceration with
socialist rhetoric, are accused of essentially supporting a variant of
fascism.[^49] The similarities between
"<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a> and fascism - both
characterized by "radical authoritarian ultranationalism, dictatorial
power, forcible suppression of opposition and control of industry" - are
striking.[^50]

## Contemporary Debates

### Limits of Cooperation

Modern anarchists continue debating where cooperation is appropriate.
Most agree that working together on specific campaigns - opposing
gender-based violence, climate change, organizing workplaces, fighting
for land reform - creates few serious divisions.[^51]

However, parting of ways occurs over how to pursue these aims and over
long-term vision. As McGregor argues: "Silencing the debate in the name
of unity might be well-intentioned, but it shuts down useful debates and
democratic space. Additionally, it prefigures a politics that views
difference as dangerous."[^52]

### Theory and Practice

The relationship between theory and practice remains contentious.
Anti-theoretical approaches present difference as problematic dogma or
sectarianism, unable to see that differences are useful. Theory is both
a process and instrument of human action; socialist theory cannot be
divorced from progressive socialist action.[^53]

As Yarros argued: "Sociology, it is true, is still in its infancy; and
there are no thoroughly-established laws and rules which one might with
safety follow. But surely this is no reason for 'working together' with
those who do not share your views. This is a very strong reason,
however, for — abstaining from practical 'work'."[^54]

### Unity Requires Care

For those advocating forms of cooperation, emphasis is placed on the
necessity of care and anti-oppression work. Unity requires deep
commitment to each others' struggles, including confronting problems
through structural oppression. This means challenging and dismantling
violent hierarchies, borders, and institutions that preserve fractures
and enforce the status quo.[^55]

Real community requires rejection of those invested in oppression in any
form - as abusive parents or partners, landlords, bosses, cops,
capitalists, and statists. This necessitates divesting from top-down
systems protecting and benefiting those higher up while ensuring a lower
class to exploit.[^56]

### Anarchism Without Adjectives

Some anarchists propose
**"<a   href="anarchism_without_adjectives.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchism without adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>**
as a solution, suggesting anarchists should tolerate diversity of
economic and social arrangements within anarchism itself. However, this
is distinct from left unity with non-anarchist socialists, as it
maintains opposition to authority and the state while allowing for
multiple anarchist visions of post-revolutionary society.

## Alternative Proposals

### Bands Rather Than Communities

Some critics of left unity also critique the **community ideal** itself
as authority-forming, pointing to groups like the
"<a   href="Hadza.md" class="wikilink" title="Hadza">Hadza</a> people of east
Africa who live in small, autonomous bands rather than organized
communities.[^57]

The Hadza are nomadic, have no leaders, gods, rules, crops, property, or
marriage. They practice no division of labor and will split up and drift
away from a band without hesitation when it ceases to suit their
interests. This represents "living anarchy" without the hierarchies
inherent in most conceptions of community.[^58]

### Working Class Institutions

Rather than left unity, some emphasize building and strengthening
working class institutions - unions, community-based movements,
cooperatives - that can cooperate around specific campaigns. A battle of
ideas occurs within these movements, with different groups competing for
influence but never imposing their ideology.[^59]

This requires engaging ideas in an open, honest, critical and
self-reflective way, contributing to development of instruments of
revolutionary class struggle. Internal developmental struggle should be
waged as a battle of ideas, but never imposed onto mass movements.[^60]

### Autonomous Organization

Emphasis on maintaining
**"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>** -
continuing to organize independently while engaging in specific
collaborations - offers a middle path. Autonomy means not acting like
fascists to gain power over each other, actively contesting
authoritarian milieus, and practicing horizontalism as an ongoing
negotiation of positionality and difference rather than a fixed
structure.[^61]

## Strategic Considerations

### When to March Separate, When to Strike Together

The history of anarchism provides lessons for analyzing potential
outcomes at any conjuncture. While the Popular Front was disastrous,
subsumating revolutionary movements to bourgeois interests, the United
Front can be refined and drawn upon in important situations, from
revolutionary moments to anti-fascist work.[^62]

The Grouping of Tendency, developed from FAU experiences and refined by
especifist organizations, can be useful depending on tasks and means of
achieving them. Revolutionaries should ask:

- What approach best serves both the movement and the growth of the
  ideology?
- What means can achieve the ends sought in a particular moment?
- What are the balance of forces?
- Are we working in unions, social movements, or facing revolutionary
  transformation?
- Will betrayal or repression smash us, our allies, or the movement?
- How does the international situation inform prospects?[^63]

### Context-Dependent Analysis

The situation today differs immensely from historical examples. A
framework is a useful guide based on previous experience, but not a
substitute for politics and the ability to think critically and
collectively analyze situations.[^64]

Correct understanding requires not only concrete involvement in mass
struggle, but theoretical unity and sense of direction. This is the
strength of the specific anarchist-communist organization, avoiding
mistakes of other tendencies and movements. What matters is that actions
contribute to development of working class power.[^65]
