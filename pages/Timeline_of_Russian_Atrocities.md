  than a thousand. The attacks are blamed on Islamic separatists and
  used to justify a war.[^1]
- 1999: *Alleged by a former Russian spy -*Russia helps orchestrate the
  shooting at the Armenian Parliament which kills 8 senior politicians,
  including the prime minister to derail the peace process which would
  have resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, no evidence has
  been produced, suggesting either a cover-up or misinformation by
  anti-russian activists.[^2]
