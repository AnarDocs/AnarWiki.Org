# International Workers' Association

## History

### Origins

The **International Workers' Association** (**IWA-AIT**) emerged from
the anarcho-syndicalist movement's rejection of
"<a   href="Bolshevism.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevism">"Bolshevism</a>
following the "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">"Russian Revolution</a>. After the success of
the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1918, there was initially a wave of
syndicalist successes worldwide, including struggles by the
"<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">"Industrial Workers of the
World</a> in the USA and the creation of mass anarchist unions across
Latin America.

Many syndicalist unions initially showed interest when the
"<a   href="Bolshevik_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bolshevik Party">"Bolshevik Party</a> issued an appeal in 1919 for
workers to join in building a new Red International. Almost all
syndicalist unions attended the 1920 congress of the Bolsheviks'
"<a   href="Comintern.md" class="wikilink" title="Comintern">"Comintern</a>,
with unions in France and Italy joining immediately.

However, disillusionment with Bolshevik authoritarianism led to an
irrevocable break. The IWA was formed at an illegal conference in Berlin
in December 1922, marking the complete separation between the
international syndicalist movement and the Bolsheviks.

The founding signatories represented over 1 million workers worldwide:

- The "<a   href="Unione_Sindacale_Italiana.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Unione Sindacale Italiana">"Unione Sindacale Italiana</a> (USI):
  500,000 members
- The "<a   href="Federación_Obrera_Regional_Argentina.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Federación Obrera Regional Argentina">"Federación Obrera Regional
  Argentina</a> (FORA): 200,000 members
- The "<a   href="General_Confederation_of_Labour.md" class="wikilink"
  title="General Confederation of Labour">"General Confederation of
  Labour</a> (Portugal): 150,000 members
- The "<a   href="Free_Workers&#39;_Union_of_Germany.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Free Workers&#39; Union of Germany">"Free Workers' Union of
  Germany</a> (FAUD): 120,000 members
- The Committee for the Defense of Syndicalism (France): 100,000 members
- The
  "<a   href="Central_Organisation_of_the_Workers_of_Sweden.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden">"Central
  Organisation of the Workers of Sweden</a> (SAC): 32,000 members
- Various other unions from Mexico, Netherlands, Chile, Norway, and
  Denmark

The "<a   href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">"Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT) from Spain, which would have been the largest member
with 600,000 workers, was unable to attend when their delegates were
arrested, but joined the following year.

### Current Status

The IWA experienced massive decline during the 1930s due to government
repression across the world. By the end of that decade, legal
anarcho-syndicalist unions existed only in Chile, Bolivia, Sweden and
Uruguay.

In 2016, the organization faced a major crisis when the CNT (Spain), USI
(Italy), and FAU (Germany) - representing 80-90% of the IWA's
membership - were expelled. These organizations formed the
"<a   href="International_Confederation_of_Labour.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Confederation of Labour">"International
Confederation of Labour</a> (ICL-CIT) in 2018. By 2020, the IWA's
membership had dwindled to less than 1,000 active members, mostly in
Europe.

## Organisation

The IWA explicitly rejects
"<a   href="centralism.md" class="wikilink" title="centralism">"centralism</a>,
"<a   href="political_parties.md" class="wikilink"
title="political parties">"political parties</a>,
"<a   href="parliamentarism.md" class="wikilink"
title="parliamentarism">"parliamentarism</a> and
"<a   href="statism.md" class="wikilink" title="statism">"statism</a>,
including the "<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a>. Drawing on anarchist critiques of state power,
particularly "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>'s warning that "If you took
the most ardent revolutionary, vested him in absolute power, within a
year he would be worse than the Tsar himself."[^1]

The organization emphasizes direct action by workers as the primary
method of social change. According to the IWA's statutes:

*Revolutionary unionism asserts itself to be a supporter of the method
of direct action, and aids and encourages all struggles that are not in
contradiction to its own goals. Its methods of struggle are: strikes,
boycotts, sabotage, etc. Direct action reaches its deepest expression in
the general strike, which should also be, from the point of view of
revolutionary unionism, the prelude to the social revolution.*[^2]

The IWA has maintained an anti-militarist stance since its founding,
reflecting the anarchist position that the
"<a   href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">"working
class</a> should not participate in power struggles between
"<a   href="ruling_class.md" class="wikilink" title="ruling class">"ruling
classes</a>. In 1926, it founded an International Anti-Militarist
Coalition to promote "<a   href="disarmament.md" class="wikilink"
title="disarmament">"disarmament</a> and gather information on war
production.[^3]

## Criticism

The IWA has faced criticism for organizational rigidity and inability to
adapt to changing conditions. The 2016 split highlighted internal
tensions over strategy and practice. Critics argue that the
organization's strict adherence to traditional anarcho-syndicalist
principles has limited its effectiveness in modern labor organizing.

The expelled organizations that formed the ICL-CIT cited disagreements
over the IWA's approach to contemporary organizing and its perceived
bureaucratic tendencies as reasons for the split.
