The Woodstock Music & Art Fair, was a music festival held on Max
Yasgur's farm in Bethel, New York from August 15 to 18, 1969. Some
40,000 attendees in effect lived for 3 days in a free city. Encyclopedia
Britannica reports that security forces were "virtually
nonexistent".[^1] There were 2 recorded fatalities, one from an apparent
heroin overdose and one when a tractor driver accidentally ran over
someone sleeping in a hayfield. [^2]

Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers, an anarchist collective based in New
York City, cut the fences at Woodstock, allowing people to enter the
festival without paying.[^3]

Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action[^4]:

> \[Spontaneous order\] could be seen in spite of commercial
> exploitation in the pop festivals of the late 1960s, in a way which is
> not apparent to the reader of newspaper headlines. From 'A
> cross-section of informed opinion' in an appendix to a report to the
> government, a local authority representative mentions 'an atmosphere
> of peace and contentment which seems to be dominant amongst the
> participants' and a church representative mentions 'a general
> atmosphere of considerable relaxation, friendliness and a great
> willingness to share'.[^5] The same kind of comments were made about
> the instant city of the Woodstock Festival in the United States:
> 'Woodstock, if permanent, would have become one of America's major
> cities in size alone, and certainly a unique one in the principles by
> which its citizens conducted themselves.'\[20\]
