## Background

The Spanish "<a   href="Colonialism.md" class="wikilink"

"<a   href="Mexico.md" class="wikilink" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> led to
"<a   href="genocide.md" class="wikilink" title="genocide">genocide</a> of

"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="communal indigenous land">communal indigenous land</a>. Although
the indigenous led many uprisings and guerilla wars against the Spanish
colonizers, they largely failed due to inferior military technology,
genocidal tactics used by the Spanish army and the destruction of
communities due to diseases. Upon Mexico's independence from
"<a   href="Spain.md" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a>, exploitation
of indigenous communities and labor intensified.[^1]

During the Mexican Revolution (1910 - 1920), several guerilla leaders
like
"<a   href="Emilio_Zapata.md" class="wikilink" title="Emilio Zapata">Emilio
Zapata</a> advocated the creation of autonomous indigenous nations in
Southern Mexico and stressed the need for common ownership of land.
Although he was killed, he inspired numerous activists and rebels over
the next hundred years. The new dictatorship which came out of the
Mexican Revolution further exploited.[^2]

In 1983, in response to massacres of students protesting the Mexican
dictatorship, six people in Chiapas became rebels and formed the EZLN.
Training for guerilla warfare in jungle camps, holding reading groups
and spreading revolutionary propaganda among the impoverished population
of Chiapas.[^3] The turning point for much of the population was the
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which would
see indigenous land be handed over to private companies, increased
income inequality and destruction of ecosystems.[^4]

## Events

December 1993: EZLN guerilla camps in the Lacandon Jungle are raided by
the Mexican military. In response, the First Declaration of the Lacandon
Jungle is announced, declaring the Mexican state illegitmate and the
right for indigenous people to form their own nations, as well as the
need for common ownership of land.

1st of January 1994: As NAFTA goes into effect, EZLN seizes seven towns
in Chiapas, burning down police stations after stealing guns and
government buildings, barricading the streets and freeing political
prisoners.

2nd of January 1994: The Mexican military begins to counter-attack, the
EZLN kidnaps the governor of Chiapas.

3rd-11th of January 1994: Skirmishes between the EZLN and Mexican
military kill hundreds of people as the Mexican military deploys
helicopters, fighter jets, tanks, APCs and special forces.

12th of January 1994: Ceasefire is declared between the EZLN and Mexican
military after pro-EZLN protesters fill every major Mexican city.[^5]

## Result

The Zapatista Revolution was extremely successful, and created a large
autonomous zone known as the
"<a   href="Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md" class="wikilink"
title="Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities">Rebel Zapatista
Autonomous Municipalities</a>. The extreme outpouring of support led to
the massive growth of the
"<a   href="Global_Justice_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Global Justice Movement">Global Justice Movement</a> and the fall
of the PRI dictatorship in Mexico, beginning a

Mexico.
