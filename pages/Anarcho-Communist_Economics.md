# Anarcho-Communist Economics

**Anarcho-Communist Economics** represents an economic model based on
the principles of freedom and solidarity, where distribution occurs
according to need rather than ability to pay or work contribution. This
system eliminates markets, wage labor, and private property while
organizing production and distribution through federated councils and
decentralized planning.

## Origins

Anarcho-communist economics emerged in the 1870s as a synthesis of
anarchist political theory with communist economic principles. The model
developed as a response to both capitalist exploitation and the
authoritarian tendencies of state socialism. Key theorists like
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> argued that human cooperation, rather than competition,
was the driving force of evolution and social progress.

## Core Principles

### Needs-Based Distribution

The fundamental principle of anarcho-communist economics is distribution
according to need. Needs are defined as what individuals require for a
good life, though the distinction between needs and desires remains
fluid and context-dependent. This system operates on the understanding
that when basic security exists, hoarding becomes unnecessary and
counterproductive.

### Abolition of Wage Labor

Anarcho-communist economics rejects all forms of wage labor, including
token-based systems representing work hours. This rejection stems from
several concerns: the impossibility of fair wage calculation, the
degrading nature of external motivation, the exclusion of care work from
economic consideration, and the ableist assumptions about "normal" human
productivity.

### Common Ownership

Rather than private or state ownership, anarcho-communist economics
operates through use-based access to resources. The means of production
are maintained by those responsible for production but are not owned by
them. Land, houses, and resources function like a library system where
items are used when needed and returned afterward.

## Organizational Structure

### Local Level

In a model suggested by Katja Einsfeld[^1] local organization typically
involves communities of up to 150 people organized through three types
of structures:

- **Consumer councils** - organized around neighborhoods or chosen
  families, collecting information on community needs
- **Production collectives** - organized around production processes and
  services, providing information on capabilities
- **Coordination committees** - consisting of rotating delegates who
  facilitate between needs and production capabilities

### Supralocal Coordination

Larger-scale coordination occurs through federated councils where
delegates from local communities exchange information and coordinate
across regions. These federations serve as facilitation structures
rather than power structures, with decision-making remaining with those
affected by the decisions.

## Planning and Decision-Making

### Decentralized Planning

Unlike centrally planned economies, anarcho-communist economics employs
distributed planning decided by affected communities. Planning occurs at
multiple time scales - from weekly production schedules to multi-year
infrastructure development - with the flexibility to adapt to changing
circumstances.

### Information Systems

Rather than relying on market prices or universal units of account, the
system uses context-specific metrics and "calculation in kind."
Information flows through decentralized, federated networks that prevent
central control while enabling coordination.

### Conflict Resolution

Decisions are enforced through community accountability rather than
state apparatus. Conflicts over resource allocation or participation are
resolved through community processes, with separation as a last resort
for those who repeatedly cause harm and refuse accountability.

## Production and Work

### Work Distribution

Necessary work is distributed through voluntary coordination, with
rotation encouraged for unpopular tasks. Some positions requiring
extensive training may involve longer commitments, while others can be
organized as community efforts or shared responsibilities.

### Innovation and Research

Innovation is supported through resource allocation for experimental
projects, with decisions made by affected communities or federated
councils for larger initiatives. The free sharing of information
accelerates development without profit motives constraining cooperation.

## Resource Management

### Scarcity and Distribution

For abundant resources, distribution occurs freely. Scarce resources
require community decision-making using various methods:

- Transparency about scarcity to encourage conservation
- Importance rankings for distribution priorities
- Preference for higher-need individuals or communities
- Optimization algorithms for complex allocation decisions

### Environmental Considerations

Resource use incorporates solidarity with future generations while
avoiding "longtermist" ideologies that subordinate present needs.
Environmental restoration becomes part of necessary work, with
communities making collective decisions about sustainable practices.

## Historical Examples

Several historical movements have implemented aspects of
anarcho-communist economics:

- The "<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Makhnovshchina">"Makhnovshchina</a> (1917-1922) in Ukraine
- Collectives during the "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Spanish Revolution">"Spanish Revolution</a> (1936-1939)
- Contemporary examples in the
  "<a   href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">"Zapatista</a>
  movement and
  "<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">"Rojava</a>

These experiments demonstrate the viability of anarcho-communist
principles, though most were ended by external military intervention
rather than internal failure.

## Transformation

### Prefigurative Politics

Transformation toward anarcho-communist economics occurs through
building alternative structures within existing systems - creating
networks, cooperatives, and mutual aid organizations that embody
anarchist principles while meeting present needs.

### Coexistence

During transition periods, anarcho-communist economics could potentially
coexist with other non-exploitative economic systems under specific
conditions:

- Maintenance of ecosystem sustainability
- Universal access to basic needs
- Free choice of economic systems
- Equitable access to scarce resources
- Transparency and non-violence

## Criticism

Critics often raise concerns about motivation without monetary
incentives, coordination complexity, and human nature. Proponents
respond that intrinsic motivation proves more effective than external
coercion, that modern communication technology enables decentralized
coordination, and that cooperative rather than competitive behavior
represents the evolutionary advantage for humans.
