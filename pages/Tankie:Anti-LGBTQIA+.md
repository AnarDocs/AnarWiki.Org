### Notes

- Repression of gay rights coincided in Nazi Germany (1934) and the USSR
  (1933)
- Cuban government leans into LGBT issues to bolster support amongst the
  international left. Outside of government affairs, LGBT communities
  often overlaps with anarchism or libertarian Marxism and thus are
  repressed by the state for political affiliations
