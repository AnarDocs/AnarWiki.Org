Anarchist analysis identifies multiple interconnected harms stemming
from private property:

## Critiques of Private Property

### Inequality

Private property creates extreme wealth disparities and generational
privilege. Workers creating immense value receive meagre compensation
whilst owners extract billions. A garment worker spending twelve hours
daily crafting valuable clothing barely survives, whilst shareholders
who never touched a sewing machine pocket profits as 'returns on
investment.'

### Poverty

Private property enables monopolistic exploitation and rent-seeking.
When essential resources like housing, medicine or water are privately
owned, owners charge far more than provision costs. Pharmaceutical
companies holding patents on life-saving drugs set exploitative prices
regardless of suffering caused. The more crucial and irreplaceable a
resource, the more likely it faces exploitative pricing.

### Corruption

Private property creates gaps in social and political power. Property
owners bankroll political campaigns, establish think tanks, purchase
media outlets and steer public discourse beyond ordinary people's
capacity. This transforms democracy from 'one person, one vote' into
'one pound, one vote.'

### Hierarchy

Private property grants owners power to control others, much like feudal
lords. Modern landlords dictate how tenants live, factory owners control
when workers speak and move, and intellectual property owners restrict
access to knowledge. This power dynamic is fundamentally incompatible
with freedom.

### Injustice

Private property establishes a justice system biased against those
without wealth. The wealthy afford skilled lawyers and fight charges
effectively, whilst the poor accept bad plea deals due to inadequate
defence. Corporations causing widespread harm receive minor fines,
whilst desperate theft results in imprisonment.

### Ecological Destruction

Private property transforms ecosystems into commodities for quick profit
extraction. When forests, rivers and soil become balance sheet items,
long-term health yields to quarterly earnings. Indigenous communities
who stewarded land sustainably for generations understood humans belong
to the earth, not vice versa. Privatisation reverses this relationship,
resulting in collective ecological destruction.

### Violence

Private property relies on the threat and use of force. Every 'No
Trespassing' sign carries implicit warning of removal, fines or
imprisonment. Property owners delegate violence to authorities, but the
dynamic remains - exclusive claims prevent others meeting basic needs
through force.

This structural violence permeates society: children hungry whilst food
rots in warehouses, people freezing whilst buildings stand empty,
patients dying because medicine exists but is priced beyond reach.
Without police, courts and prisons enforcing exclusive claims, property
as currently conceived would disappear.

### Loss of Freedom

Private property creates artificial scarcity benefiting few at cost to
many and the planet. It warps freedom itself, reducing it from full
realisation of human potential to merely owners' rights over their
belongings.

True freedom comes not from accumulating private property but from
ensuring everyone has what they need to thrive - not as privilege
granted by owners but as inherent human right. This vision of collective
flourishing rather than individualistic accumulation points toward a
society where freedom is measured not by possessions but by lives fully
lived.

## Alternatives

### Usage Rights

![](Usage_Rights.jpg "Usage_Rights.jpg") Most anarchists reject property
rights in favour of **usage rights** or **possession**. Under this
system, people keep what they use for themselves, but when they cease
using it, resources return to the commons.

This contrasts with private property logic: 'If you use it first, you
keep it forever, and if anyone uses it after you, you can charge them
for access indefinitely.'

Usage rights systems have existed throughout human history, from
indigenous stewardship to medieval commons to modern collectives. These
alternatives demonstrate humans can fulfil needs whilst preserving
ecological balance without resorting to deprivation and violence
associated with exclusive private property.
