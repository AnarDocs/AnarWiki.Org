# Saw Gerrera (Fictional Anarchist Revolutionary)

**Saw Gerrera** was a human male revolutionary fighter from the planet
Onderon who became one of the earliest organized rebels against the
Galactic Empire. Beginning as a monarchist resistance fighter during the
Clone Wars, Gerrera's political philosophy evolved through decades of
struggle into explicit
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a>,
making him one of the few characters in Star Wars to explicitly identify
with a specific political ideology.[^1]

Gerrera was instrumental in forming what would become the Rebel
Alliance, though his increasingly militant tactics led to his censure by
Alliance leadership. He led the Partisans, an extremist rebel faction
that operated independently from the main Alliance. Despite his
controversial methods, Gerrera played a crucial role in uncovering the
existence of the Death Star and inspiring the mission that ultimately
led to its destruction.[^2]

## Early Life

Saw Gerrera was born on the jungle planet Onderon during the final years
of the Galactic Republic. He grew up within the walls of Onderon's
capital city of Iziz alongside his younger sister Steela Gerrera. Both
siblings developed great respect for Onderon's longtime monarch, King
Ramsis Dendup.[^3]

As a young man, Gerrera was imprisoned in a rhydonium work camp in the
Onderon jungles. The harsh conditions and chemical exposure from
rhydonium leaks killed many prisoners, but Gerrera survived and
developed both a physical tolerance and psychological attraction to the
substance that would later contribute to his physical deterioration.[^4]

## Political Awakening

### From Monarchy to Revolution

Gerrera's political transformation began when the benevolent King Dendup
was overthrown by Separatist forces during the Clone Wars and replaced
with puppet ruler King Sanjay Rash. This betrayal shattered Gerrera's
faith not only in monarchy but ultimately in the concept of rulers
altogether.[^5]

As one analysis notes: "This political awakening came through direct
experience of state betrayal. Gerrera witnessed how even supposedly
legitimate authority could be corrupted by external imperial
forces."[^6] He became the de facto leader of the Onderon rebels,
fighting to restore his planet's independence.

### Training and Contradictions

The Jedi Order provided training to Gerrera's guerrilla forces, with
Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, along
with Clone Captain Rex, teaching the Onderonians combat tactics and
strategy.[^7] However, this alliance revealed contradictions that would
shape Gerrera's anarchist worldview. The Jedi, despite their sympathy
for Onderon's liberation, remained constrained by their institutional
loyalties to the Republic's political machinations.[^8]

The death of Steela during the final battle for Onderon's liberation
marked a crucial turning point. Gerrera felt responsible for her death
and this loss transformed his understanding of revolution from an
abstract political necessity into a deeply personal crusade.[^9]

## Anarchism and Revolutionary Philosophy

### Explicit Identification

By the time of the Galactic Civil War, Gerrera had evolved into an
explicit anarchist. In a conversation with rebel coordinator Luthen Rael
on the moon of Segra Milo, Rael accused him of embracing anarchy:

> Luthen: "Well anarchy is a seductive concept. A bit of a luxury I'd
> argue to a man who is hiding in cold caves, and begging for spare
> parts."
>
> Gerrera: "I am the only one with clarity of purpose."[^10]

Significantly, Gerrera did not correct or reject this characterization,
confirming his anarchist identity.[^11] As noted in analysis of the
character: "The 'anarchy' Luthen references isn't chaos (though the word
has come to be associated with disorder), but a principled rejection of
hierarchical coordination."[^12]

### Means and Ends

Gerrera's anarchism centered on the question of revolutionary means
versus ends. He understood that the methods used in revolution must
align with revolutionary goals, otherwise those carrying out the
revolution risk becoming as authoritarian as the regimes they
oppose.[^13]

This reflects the classical anarchist position articulated by theorists
like "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>, who warned that
revolutionary dictatorships, even temporary ones, would inevitably seek
to perpetuate themselves.[^14] However, Gerrera's practice often
contradicted this principle, as his increasingly brutal tactics came to
mirror the very violence he fought against.

### Rejection of Hierarchy

Gerrera's reluctance to subordinate his Partisans to broader rebel
networks reflected a core
"<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">"libertarian socialist</a> concern: that
revolutionary organizations, if they mirror the hierarchical structures
they oppose, will inevitably reproduce those same power dynamics in any
post-revolutionary society.[^15]

His motto "I am not a terrorist. I'm a patriot. And resistance is not
terrorism" expressed his view that state definitions of legitimacy were
meaningless to those already branded as outlaws.[^16]

## Revolutionary Methods

### Extremism and Violence

Gerrera's tactics became increasingly extreme over the decades of
struggle. He employed interrogation techniques, targeted assassinations,
and bombings that alienated him from other rebel leaders. Alliance High
Command, at the urging of Mon Mothma, formally censured Gerrera and
severed official ties with the Partisans.[^17]

His orchestrated bombing that killed Moff Quarsh Panaka nearly also
killed Princess Leia Organa, demonstrating how revolutionary violence
could become indistinguishable from the terror it claimed to
oppose.[^18] Such tactics followed the logic of 19th-century anarchist
""<a   href="Propaganda_of_the_Deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="Propaganda of the Deed">"Propaganda of the Deed</a>" - using
dramatic violent acts to inspire broader uprising while demonstrating
state vulnerability.[^19]

### Conflict with Mon Mothma

Gerrera's fundamental disagreement with Alliance leader Mon Mothma
crystallized the tension between revolutionary and reformist approaches.
When Mothma criticized him for targeting civilians and breaking rules of
engagement, Gerrera responded:

> "If we degrade ourselves to the Empire's level, what will we become?"
>
> "There she is! That's the leader the Rebellion needs! Where is that
> fire? That passion when your people need it most? I hope, Senator,
> after you've lost, and the Empire reigns over the galaxy unopposed,
> you will find some comfort in the knowledge that you fought according
> to the rules."[^20]

This exchange revealed what anarchists would identify as the "reformist
fallacy" - that oppressive systems can be transformed through moral
suasion rather than revolutionary force.[^21]

### The Spellhaus Compromise

The moral complexity of Gerrera's position was demonstrated in the
Spellhaus operation. When Luthen Rael revealed that Imperial
intelligence had learned of rebel leader Anto Kreegyr's planned attack,
Gerrera faced an impossible choice: warn Kreegyr and lose their Imperial
spy, or let thirty rebels walk into a trap to preserve their
intelligence network.

Gerrera ultimately agreed to sacrifice Kreegyr's forces "for the greater
good," prioritizing strategic calculation over immediate
solidarity.[^22] This decision revealed how even principled
revolutionaries could find themselves complicit in the power structures
they opposed. By accepting that some lives were more valuable than
others for "the cause," Gerrera adopted the utilitarian logic he had
spent decades fighting against.[^23]

## Physical and Psychological Deterioration

### Chemical Dependency

Gerrera's prolonged exposure to rhydonium fumes, beginning in his youth
in the work camps, evolved into a deliberate addiction. He inhaled the
volatile fuel through his breathing apparatus, describing the chemical
as his "sister" - a substitute for his lost sibling Steela.[^24]

During training of young recruit Wilmon Paak, Gerrera articulated his
philosophy of revolutionary madness:

> "Revolution is not for the sane. Look at us. Unloved. Hunted. Cannon
> fodder. We'll all be dead before the Republic is back and yet here we
> are."[^25]

This chemical dependency served as metaphor for how prolonged resistance
can corrupt the resistor. The rhydonium that fueled his ships also
poisoned his mind, creating a cycle where the tools of liberation became
instruments of self-destruction.[^26]

### Physical Decline

By the time of his final years, Gerrera had lost his right leg to injury
and required a basic cybernetic replacement. His damaged lungs confined
him to a pressurized armor suit with supplemental oxygen apparatus.[^27]
His body, like his movement, had been poisoned by prolonged exposure to
the violence he believed would liberate him.[^28]

## Death and Legacy

### Final Stand on Jedha

In 1 BBY, Gerrera based his operations on the moon of Jedha, where the
Empire was extracting kyber crystals. When defecting Imperial pilot
Bodhi Rook brought a message from scientist Galen Erso about the Death
Star, Gerrera's paranoia led him to torture Rook with the creature Bor
Gullet rather than trust the information immediately.[^29]

Gerrera reunited with his former ward Jyn Erso, whom he had abandoned
years earlier. When she confronted him about leaving her at age sixteen
with only a knife and blaster, he claimed he was protecting her,
revealing how completely he had internalized militaristic values that
reduced human relationships to tactical considerations.[^30]

As Grand Moff Tarkin test-fired the Death Star's superlaser on Jedha
City, Gerrera released his prisoners and urged Jyn to save the Rebellion
with her father's message. But he refused to flee, dying in the blast
wave with the words: "Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!"[^31]

### The Dreamers

Following Gerrera's death, his surviving partisans renamed themselves
"the Dreamers" in tribute to his final words. As one explained:

> "We call ourselves the Dreamers. We can't be him. We're just following
> in his footsteps. We're keeping alive the dream. Saw was the face, the
> voice, of our cause."[^32]

This transformation suggested recognition that Gerrera himself had lost
sight of revolutionary dreams in favor of revolutionary nightmares. The
survivors attempted to reclaim the vision from the man, separating
liberatory goals from destructive methods.[^33]

### Historical Assessment

Dave Filoni, supervising director of The Clone Wars, considered Gerrera
"the original rebel... the first one in a long line of people that got
trained by Jedi to fight for themselves during the Clone Wars. He's the
beginning of what would eventually become the Rebel Alliance."[^34]

Without Gerrera's mentorship of Jyn Erso and his role in uncovering the
Death Star plans, the Rebellion's ultimate victory may not have been
possible. Yet his legacy remains deeply ambiguous - a reminder of both
the necessity of armed resistance against tyranny and the danger of
allowing revolutionary methods to corrupt revolutionary ideals.[^35]

## Analysis

Gerrera's character embodies the central tension in anarchist
revolutionary ethics: the relationship between means and ends. His
extremism emerged from genuine encounters with imperial brutality, yet
by abandoning ethical constraints for strategic advantage, he ensured
his revolution could never transcend the violence from which it
emerged.[^36]

The anarchist principle that means must prefigure ends finds validation
in Gerrera's failure. His story suggests that revolutionary movements
must attend not only to tactical questions but to the psychological
health of those bearing the burden of prolonged resistance. Without such
care, even the most principled rebels risk becoming the very
authoritarianism they fight against.[^37]
