# Federalism

**Federalism** is an organizational doctrine within anarchism that
advocates for society to be structured from the bottom-up, with power
flowing from the periphery to the centre rather than being imposed from
above. In anarchist theory, federalism represents a fundamental
alternative to centralized state organization, emphasizing autonomous
self-determination, free association, and voluntary coordination between
constituent groups.[^1]

## Origins

The concept of federalism appears throughout anarchist literature from
the mid-19th century onwards. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon developed the
theoretical foundation for anarchist federalism in works such as *Du
Principe Fédératif* (1863) and *La Fédération et l'Unité en Italie*
(1862), where he argued against the unification of Italy under a
centralized state and instead advocated for a federation of autonomous
communes.[^2]

Mikhail Bakunin expanded on these ideas in his 1867 address *Federalism,
Socialism, Anti-Theologism*, presented to the League for Peace and
Freedom. Bakunin explicitly connected federalism with socialism and the
destruction of state power, arguing that true federation required the
right of secession and the organization of society from individuals into
communes, communes into provinces, and provinces into nations through
free agreement.[^3]

Peter Kropotkin further developed federalist ideas through his
geographical and sociological work, observing functioning federative
principles in the watchmaking communities of the Jura Mountains and
arguing for decentralized organization based on regional ecology and
local conditions.[^4]

## Principles

### Bottom-Up Organization

Anarchist federalism operates on the principle that organization should
flow from the base upward. Higher-order units exist solely as direct
expressions of lower-order units combining and delegating certain tasks
for practical coordination. There is no central authority that issues
commands from above; instead, direction emerges from constituent units
collaborating freely with each other.[^5]

### Autonomy and Self-Determination

Constituent groups within a federation maintain complete autonomy. They
can associate or disassociate as they choose, bound only by the
principles and aims they agreed to upon federating. Each unit controls
its own finances, administration, and decision-making processes. This
autonomy extends to the right of secession - groups can leave a
federation at any time, though they would consequently lose the benefits
that federating provided.[^6]

### Delegation and Mandates

While higher-order committees and councils may exist for coordination,
these bodies hold no power to direct the federation itself. They are
composed of delegates who carry strict, revocable mandates from their
constituent groups. These delegates do not represent their groups in the
parliamentary sense; rather, they carry out specific instructions and
can be recalled at any time.[^7]

### Free Association

The right to free association forms the foundation of anarchist
federalism. Groups federate voluntarily based on common interests and
mutual benefit, not through coercion or legal obligation. This principle
applies at all levels, from individuals forming communes to communes
forming broader federations. As Bakunin stated: "The right of free union
and equally free secession is the first, the most important, of all
political rights, the one right without which the federation would never
be more than a centralization in disguise."[^8]

### Collective Force

Proudhon introduced the concept of "collective force" to explain how
federations produce power greater than the sum of their parts. When
individuals or groups combine their efforts, they create an immense
power that results from their union, harmony, and simultaneous action.
This collective force maintains and guarantees the federal contract
without becoming something superior to the federated groups, as the
state is to society. The collective force emerges from the federation
itself rather than being imposed upon it.[^9]

## Distinction from State Federalism

Anarchist federalism differs fundamentally from republican or state
federalism as practiced in countries like Switzerland or the United
States. While state federalism involves devolution of powers to regional
governments, it retains the basic structure of the state and conception
of national unity.

James Guillaume outlined these distinctions clearly. In republican
federalism, constituent units (such as Swiss cantons) possess limited
autonomy constrained by a federal constitution. They are considered
fractions of a whole called the nation, rather than distinct, sovereign
entities. The federal constitution is an imposition rather than a free
contract, and constituent units have no right to secede. Guillaume
dismissed this as "federalism only in the words."[^10]

Anarchist federalism, in contrast:

- Eliminates the nation-state entirely, replacing it with autonomous
  communes
- Removes central authority superior to the groups
- Bases organization solely on mutual interest without regard for
  nationalism or territorial sovereignty
- Guarantees absolute right of secession
- Extends federative principles to economics and all social relations,
  not just politics

Proudhon argued that state federalism in countries like the United
States merely delegates repressive functions to local elites while
preserving the fundamental function of protecting private property and
the subordination of workers to capitalists. The federal police may be
replaced by state police, but the effect remains the same.[^11]

## Unity Through Diversity

Anarchist federalism embraces diversity as essential rather than
problematic. Bakunin stated: "Uniformity is death. Diversity is life."
He argued that disciplinary unity imposed on social life kills nations,
while living unity emerges through the free and diverse manifestations
of life expressing themselves through struggle, creating balance and
harmony of all forces.[^12]

This principle rejects the charge that federalism leads to disunity or
chaos. For anarchists, unity must be distinguished from uniformity. The
differences in opinion and strategy that emerge naturally from diverse
people and groups working together are essential for keeping
organizations alive. The dissidence arising from different circumstances
and needs prevents the stagnation that comes from imposing fixed models
upon society.[^13]

Proudhon put it bluntly: "What you call unity and centralisation is
nothing but perpetual chaos, serving as a basis for endless tyranny; it
is the advancing of the chaotic condition of social forces as an
argument for despotism — a despotism which is really the cause of the
chaos."[^14]

## Economic Federalism

Anarchist federalism extends beyond political organization to economic
relations. Proudhon envisioned replacing the state's political
structures with economic organization:

"In place of laws, we will put contracts. In place of political powers,
we will put economic forces. In place of the ancient classes of nobles,
burghers, and peasants, or of bourgeoisie and proletariat, we will put
the general titles and special departments of industry: Agriculture,
Manufacture, Commerce, etc. In place of public force, we will put
collective force. In place of standing armies, we will put industrial
associations."[^15]

This means federating not just political communes but also workers'
associations, industrial groups, and economic enterprises. The future
society would organize itself by federations of industrial groups
according to the needs of production, rather than by divisions of
nations according to the needs of politics.[^16]

Rudolf Rocker emphasized how federalism functioned in practice through
the guild system of medieval Italian cities. Each guild elected
representatives to the municipal council where they carried out their
organization's instructions and reached settlements through conference
with other organizations' delegates. This contrasted sharply with modern
parliamentary states where neither voters nor representatives can
properly supervise the political apparatus, leading to corruption and
the domination of professional politicians.[^17]

## Application and Practice

Historical examples of anarchist federalism include:

- The Paris Commune of 1871, which Guillaume identified as expressing
  federalism in practice
- The Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, where
  workers federated industries and agricultural collectives
- The Jura watchmaking communities observed by Kropotkin, which operated
  through spontaneous cooperation without hierarchical direction
- Contemporary examples in movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas and
  democratic confederalism in Rojava

## Federalism and Confederalism

The terms federalism and confederalism are often used interchangeably
within anarchist literature, though some make distinctions between them.
Both emphasize decentralization, autonomy, and voluntary association.

Where distinctions are made, confederalism sometimes indicates even
looser association than federalism, with greater emphasis on the
sovereignty of constituent parts. In this usage, a confederation
suggests that the whole exists purely at the pleasure of its parts,
which retain primary loyalty and identity. The confederal structure
exists solely to facilitate coordination on matters of mutual concern,
with no implication of permanent union.

However, most anarchist writers do not maintain a rigid distinction
between these terms. Bakunin, Proudhon, and Kropotkin used both terms to
describe the same organizational principles. The essential features
remain consistent: voluntary association, right of secession, bottom-up
organization, and the absence of centralized authority whether the
arrangement is called federal or confederal.

What matters is not the label but the relationship it describes - one
where free groups cooperate as equals without subordination to a higher
power, where unity emerges from mutual interest rather than coercion,
and where diversity strengthens rather than threatens the whole.

## Criticism

Critics of anarchist federalism have raised several objections:

- **Impracticality**: Skeptics argue that complex modern society
  requires centralized coordination that federalism cannot provide
- **Vulnerability**: Centralists claim that federated societies would be
  vulnerable to conquest by centralized states
- **Inefficiency**: Some contend that decision-making through federation
  would be slower and more cumbersome than centralized authority
- **Coordination Problems**: Questions arise about how large-scale
  infrastructure or responses to crises could be coordinated without
  central direction

Anarchist responses emphasize that:

- Historical examples demonstrate federalism's viability
- Centralization itself creates inefficiencies through bureaucracy and
  removes decision-making from those with local knowledge
- The collective force of free federation provides strength without
  sacrificing autonomy
- Voluntary coordination based on mutual interest proves more stable
  than coerced unity
