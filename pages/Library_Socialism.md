# Library Socialism

Library socialism is an economic and political philosophy that proposes
reorganising society around the principles of public libraries,
emphasising shared access to resources, communal ownership, and the
circulation of goods rather than private accumulation. The concept
gained prominence through the podcast "Srsly Wrong" and has been
elaborated by theorists including Shawn Vulliez, Aaron Moritz, and
others as a vision for post-capitalist organisation that aligns with
anarchist principles of mutual aid, anti-hierarchy, and common
ownership.[^1]

## Overview

Library socialism extends the logic of public libraries beyond books to
encompass most aspects of material life. Rather than individual
ownership of infrequently used items, the model proposes systems of
shared access where goods circulate among community members based on
need and use. This approach claims to address both ecological
sustainability and economic inequality simultaneously by reducing
redundant production whilst ensuring universal access to material
abundance.[^2]

The philosophy represents what proponents describe as "cornucopian
ideology of luxuriant circulating communal abundance" - the idea that
sharing resources more effectively can provide higher living standards
whilst reducing environmental impact.[^3]

## Foundational Principles

Library socialism rests on three core principles that distinguish it
from both capitalism and state socialism:

### Usufruct

Usufruct refers to the freedom of individuals to appropriate and use
resources by virtue of using them, whilst lacking the right to destroy
them or deny them to others when not in use. This principle derives from
Roman law but removes the right of *abusus* - the right to destroy or
permanently deny property to others.[^4]

Under usufruct, a farmer may cultivate land, but cannot prevent others
from using it when lying fallow. A person may borrow a book from a
library, but cannot destroy it or demand payment from the next reader.
This principle already exists in public libraries but library socialism
proposes extending it throughout the economy. The removal of abusus
eliminates the legal mechanism by which capitalists extract surplus
value from workers - without the ability to deny access to means of
production, the leverage for exploitation disappears.

### The Irreducible Minimum

The irreducible minimum guarantees every person a dignified standard of
living regardless of their contribution to society. Unlike Universal
Basic Income, which provides universal inputs (money), the irreducible
minimum focuses on universal outcomes - ensuring everyone can sleep
indoors in privacy, access adequate nutrition, receive healthcare, and
participate fully in society.[^5]

This principle differs from charity or conditional welfare by
establishing unconditional material security as a baseline. By removing
the threat of starvation and homelessness, it eliminates the coercion
that forces people into exploitative wage labour relationships. The
specific level of provision can start modestly and increase as
collective wealth grows, but the commitment remains absolute.

Contrary to Malthusian objections that such guarantees lead to
unsustainable population growth, observed patterns since
industrialisation show birth rates decline as material security
increases. The principle also rejects the notion that humans require
coercion to be productive - a claim thoroughly critiqued in works such
as David Graeber's *Bullshit Jobs*.[^6]

### Complementarity

Complementarity holds that non-hierarchical differences within
communities are generative rather than competitive. Just as different
metals create alloys stronger than their components, diverse
perspectives and capabilities combine to produce outcomes greater than
any individual could achieve.[^7]

This manifests in library systems where readers' annotations,
highlights, and margin notes enhance texts for subsequent users. Rather
than passive consumption, library socialism envisions active
participation where each person's engagement complements and enriches
the collective resource. Applied socially, complementarity recognises
that elderly and young people, for example, contribute different
valuable perspectives without hierarchy - experience and adaptability
both serve the whole.

## Organisation and Structure

### Commons-Based Organisation

Library socialism organises around commons - resources held and managed
collectively by communities. Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's research into
successful commons management, library socialist organisation requires:

- Clear boundaries defining who participates and what resources are
  shared
- Rules adapted to local social and ecological conditions
- Participatory decision-making processes
- Monitoring systems (through consultative associations that gather and
  share information)
- Graduated sanctions for rule violations
- Accessible conflict resolution mechanisms
- Recognition of rights to self-organise
- Nested federation when commons interact across regions[^8]

Rather than centralised control, commons emerge through free association
in "spaces of encounter" - community centres, cafes, parks, or any venue
where people gather to coordinate, negotiate, and resolve conflicts as
equals.

### Types of Access and Use

Library economies recognise multiple forms of access beyond simple
lending:

- **Exclusive use** - one person uses an item for a period (like
  borrowing a bicycle)
- **Shared use** - groups use items simultaneously or rotationally
  (household stand mixer)
- **Vocational use** - items predominantly used by particular
  occupations (lumber for carpenters)
- **Locational use** - resources tied to specific places (community
  bakery ovens)

Duration of use varies from single-use (wedding tuxedo) to daily
(shoes), weekly (rake), monthly (grill), situational (sewing kit),
annual (pressure washer), or lifetime (home, workshop). High-demand
items may require reservation whilst others remain available
spontaneously.[^9]

### Scope of the Library Economy

Library socialism applies primarily to durable goods and can encompass:

- Raw materials and resources
- Clothing, jewellery, furniture, and decor
- Electronics, tools, and appliances
- Sporting goods, camping gear, and luggage
- Vehicles and transportation equipment
- Venues and event spaces
- Housing and workshops
- Books and physical media

Consumables like food fit within the model differently - whilst
individuals consume them, the ecological cycle returns them to the
commons through composting and waste processing. Personal items like
toothbrushes and underwear remain outside communal circulation.[^10]

## Library Democracy

Library socialism rejects hierarchical political organisation in favour
of what proponents call "library democracy" - layered participatory
systems that distribute power across multiple overlapping domains.

### Multi-Layered Decision-Making

Rather than single democratic mechanisms, library democracy envisions
complex systems incorporating:

- **Workplace democracy** - eliminating hierarchical control within
  production
- **Consumer democracy** - giving users voice over goods and services
- **Neighbourhood democracy** - local control over community affairs
- **Confederation** - coordination through recallable delegates rather
  than representatives

Different issues engage different combinations of these layers.
Workplace changes might require input from workers and affected
neighbourhoods. Product development might involve workers, consumers,
and resource commons. The system remains expressive to individual
participation whilst building checks and balances through collaborative
oversight.[^11]

### Democratic Methods

Library democracy employs diverse decision-making processes suited to
context:

- Consensus for foundational decisions
- Liquid democracy for ongoing coordination
- Ranked ballots for prioritisation
- Range voting for preference intensity
- Sortition for representative selection
- Quadratic voting for resource allocation
- Face-to-face deliberation for conflict resolution

No single method dominates - the mosaic of approaches allows meaningful
participation for diverse preferences whilst valuing expertise without
creating expert rule. "Do-ocracy" - the freedom to act without
permission where actions don't significantly affect others - balances
collective oversight with individual initiative.[^12]

### Rejecting Representative Democracy

Library socialism views representative democracy as inherently elitist,
originally designed to compromise between democracy and aristocracy.
Politicians become those who "take more than their fair share of
politics for themselves." Instead, confederation uses recallable
delegates who proxy for groups rather than make independent decisions.
This structure prevents the concentration of political power whilst
maintaining coordination across scales.[^13]

## Benefits and Aims

### Ecological Sustainability

By sharing goods rather than requiring individual ownership, library
socialism reduces production of redundant items. One lawn mower
circulating among twenty households replaces twenty separately owned
mowers mostly sitting idle. This decreased material throughput allows
higher living standards with lower environmental impact - doing more
with less whilst reducing ecological damage.[^14]

Items designed for library circulation can prioritise durability,
repairability, and quality over planned obsolescence, further reducing
resource extraction and waste. The model challenges artificial scarcity
created by copyright and similar restrictions - digital works can
circulate infinitely without depletion, yet capitalism limits access to
maintain price structures.

### Economic Efficiency

Library socialism claims superior efficiency to capitalism by
eliminating resources spent enforcing property rights. Digital Rights
Management for ebooks, for example, makes systems unwieldy and limits
supply artificially. Engineering effort goes toward preventing retention
rather than improving access. Removing these artificial constraints
whilst ensuring creators receive support through the irreducible minimum
allows genuine abundance.[^15]

The model also addresses capitalism's fundamental inefficiency -
producing the wrong things in the wrong amounts for the wrong places.
Goods gravitate toward profit generation rather than need satisfaction,
creating simultaneous waste and deprivation. Library socialism proposes
distributing resources where they solve the most needs rather than
generate the most profit.

### Addressing Inequality

The irreducible minimum eliminates absolute poverty by guaranteeing
material security. Usufruct prevents accumulation of unused resources
whilst ensuring access for all. Together, these principles attack
inequality at its roots - the ability to deny resources to others and
extract value from that denial.

Unlike reforms that strengthen existing hierarchies by providing "just
enough" comfort to prevent revolt, library socialism removes the
scarcity that forces people into exploitative relationships. People
remain free to work for additional comfort beyond the minimum, but
cannot coerce others through deprivation.

## Relationship to Anarchism

Library socialism aligns with anarchist principles in several key
respects:

### Anti-Hierarchy

The rejection of abusus removes the property right necessary for
exploitation. Without ability to deny resources, hierarchical
relationships based on resource control cannot form. Library democracy's
emphasis on non-hierarchical difference as generative rather than
competitive directly opposes authoritarian organisation.[^16]

Complementarity recognises diverse contributions without ranking them
hierarchically. An elderly person and a child both contribute uniquely
without one being "above" the other. Applied to all human differences,
this principle embraces horizontal organisation over vertical command
structures.

### Mutual Aid

The library model embodies mutual aid - cooperation for mutual benefit
rather than charity or market exchange. Communities collectively
maintain resources that circulate based on need and use rather than
ability to pay. The irreducible minimum represents collective
responsibility to ensure everyone's wellbeing, aligning with anarchist
ethics of solidarity.

### Prefigurative Politics

Library socialism functions as prefigurative practice - building
institutions of the new society within the shell of the old. Tool
libraries, seed exchanges, and community resource centres demonstrate
the viability of non-capitalist distribution whilst serving immediate
needs. These projects combine narrative (spreading ideas), prefiguration
(building alternatives), and institutional practice (transforming
existing systems).[^17]

### Decentralisation

The commons-based structure promotes decentralised control through free
association rather than centralised planning. Communities organise their
own commons according to local conditions, federating where resources or
decisions span regions. This matches anarchist emphasis on local
autonomy within voluntary confederation.

### Direct Democracy

Library democracy's rejection of representative politics and emphasis on
participatory decision-making across multiple layers reflects anarchist
commitment to direct democracy. The use of recallable delegates for
coordination rather than independent representatives prevents the
formation of political classes.

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Comparison to "You'll Own Nothing"

Critics have compared library socialism to the World Economic Forum's
prediction that "you'll own nothing and be happy," associating it with
corporate service economy models. However, proponents distinguish
sharply between centralised control by corporations or states (as
implied in Ida Auken's essay "Welcome to 2030") and decentralised
commons managed by communities themselves.

Rather than owning nothing, library socialism could be characterised as
collective ownership - treating the Earth and its products as shared
inheritance managed collectively rather than exploited privately or
controlled centrally.[^18]

### Relationship to Production

Questions persist about how library socialism relates to production. The
model focuses on distribution rather than production, requiring
integration with other systems for creating goods. Proponents argue
existing overproduction means distribution improvements can provide
immediate benefits, whilst production systems can develop according to
library economy demand data and ecological limits.

Some portion of production would be allocated to ensure the irreducible
minimum for all, with remaining output distributed through other
arrangements as communities determine.[^19]

### Handling Conflict

Concerns about damaged, unreturned, or misused items require
case-by-case conflict resolution. Some situations involve natural wear,
others require repair or cleaning by users, and some demand restitution.
The approach emphasises addressing root causes rather than punitive
responses, with graduated sanctions proportional to harm.

Many public libraries have eliminated late fees, finding they obstruct
access for those most in need whilst failing to incentivise timely
returns. Library socialism may follow this precedent, using reminders
and accessible return options rather than punitive measures.[^20]

### "Human Nature" Objections

Arguments that people will exploit library systems rely on fixed notions
of human nature as inherently selfish. However, anthropological and
historical evidence demonstrates humans are capable of hierarchical or
egalitarian, cruel or kind, competitive or cooperative organisation
depending on social conditions.

The conditioning that produces exploitative behaviour under capitalism
can be resisted and reshaped through egalitarian social arrangements.
Egalitarian cultures have historically maintained their organisation
through conscious, value-based opposition to hierarchy rather than
ignorance of its possibility.[^21]

## Implementation

### Starting Small

Establishing library economies begins with specific projects like tool
libraries, building toward broader systems. Initial steps include:

- Forming affinity groups around shared vision
- Sourcing resources through donations or pooled funds
- Securing accessible locations (community centres, public libraries,
  front yard sheds)
- Developing inventory and coordination systems
- Building community buy-in through events and dialogue[^22]

### Broader Social Revolution

Proponents emphasise that library economies cannot succeed in isolation
but require connection to broader social struggles. Without
confrontation with existing power structures and noncooperation with
capitalist systems, library projects risk becoming mere charitable
ameliorations rather than revolutionary alternatives.

Tool libraries might begin with community land trusts, squatted spaces,
or rental negotiations, but must link with political and economic
movements to reach full potential. The library economy represents one
component of comprehensive social transformation, not a standalone
solution.

### Growth and Evolution

Following Ranganathan's fifth law - that libraries are growing
organisms - library economies must remain dynamic, expanding both the
quality of collections and the quantity of people served. This requires
developing systems, applications, and frameworks that save users' time
whilst allowing effective coordination.

Community events like picnics, block parties, and sports days can serve
as spaces of encounter for building trust, gathering information about
interests and concerns, and cultivating collective buy-in for
commons-based organisation.[^23]
