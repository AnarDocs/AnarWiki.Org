# Green Anarchism

**Green anarchism**, also known as **ecological anarchism** or
**eco-anarchism**, is an anarchist school of thought that focuses on
ecology and environmental issues.[^1] It is an anti-capitalist and
anti-authoritarian form of radical environmentalism, which emphasises
social organization, freedom and self-fulfillment.[^2]

## Origins

Ecological approaches to anarchism were first formulated during the 19th
century, as the rise of capitalism and colonialism caused environmental
degradation. Drawing from the ecology of Charles Darwin, the anarchist
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> elaborated a naturalist
philosophy that rejected the dualistic separation of humanity from
nature. This was developed into an ecological philosophy by
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> and
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">"Élisée
Reclus</a>, who advocated for the decentralisation and degrowth of
industry as a means to advance both social justice and environmental
protection.

### Background

Before the Industrial Revolution, the only occurrences of ecological
crisis were small-scale, localised to areas affected by natural
disasters, overproduction or war. But as the enclosure of common land
increasingly forced dispossessed workers into factories, more
wide-reaching ecological damage began to be noticed by radicals of the
period.[^3]

During the late 19th century, as capitalism and colonialism were
reaching their height, political philosophers first began to develop
critiques of industrialised society, which had caused a rise in
pollution and environmental degradation. In response, these early
environmentalists developed a concern for nature and wildlife
conservation, soil erosion, deforestation, and natural resource
management.[^4] Early political approaches to environmentalism were
supplemented by the literary naturalism of writers such as Henry David
Thoreau, John Muir and Ernest Thompson Seton,[^5] whose best-selling
works helped to alter the popular perception of nature by rejecting the
dualistic "man against nature" conflict.[^6] In particular, Thoreau's
advocacy of anti-consumerism and vegetarianism, as well as his love for
the wilderness, has been a direct inspiration for many
eco-anarchists.[^7]

Ecology in its modern form was developed by Charles Darwin, whose work
on evolutionary biology provided a scientific rejection of Christian and
Cartesian anthropocentrism, instead emphasising the role of probability
and individual agency in the process of evolution.[^8] Around the same
time, anarchism emerged as a political philosophy that rejected all
forms of hierarchy, authority and oppression, and instead advocated for
decentralisation and voluntary association.[^9] The framework for an
ecological anarchism was thus set in place, as a means to reject
anthropocentric hierarchies that positioned humans in a dominating
position over nature.[^10]

### Classical Anarchist Roots

The ecological roots of anarchism go back to the classical anarchists,
such as "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>, who both conceived of human
nature as the basis for anarchism.[^11] Drawing from Charles Darwin's
work,[^12] Bakunin considered people to be an intrinsic part of their
environment.[^13] Bakunin rejected Cartesian dualism, denying its
anthropocentric and mechanistic separation of humanity from nature.[^14]
However, he also saw humans as uniquely capable of self-determination
and called for humanity to achieve a mastery of its own natural
environment as a means to achieve freedom.[^15]

Bakunin's naturalism was developed into an ecological philosophy by the
geographers
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> and
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">"Élisée
Reclus</a>, who conceived the relationship between human society and
nature as a dialectic. Their environmental ethics, which combined social
justice with environmental protection, anticipated the green anarchist
philosophies of social ecology and bioregionalism.[^16]

Like Bakunin before him, Kropotkin extolled the domestication of nature
by humans, but also framed humanity as an intrinsic part of its natural
environment and placed great value in the natural world.[^17] Kropotkin
was among the first environmentalist thinkers to note the connections
between industrialisation, environmental degradation and workers'
alienation. In contrast to Marxists, who called for an increase in
industrialisation, Kropotkin argued for the localisation of the economy,
which he felt would increase people's connection with the land and halt
environmental damage.[^18]

In *"<a   href="Fields,_Factories_and_Workshops.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fields, Factories and Workshops">"Fields, Factories and
Workshops</a>*, Kropotkin advocated for the satisfaction of human needs
through horticulture, and the decentralisation and degrowth of
industry.[^19] He also criticised the division of labour, both between
mental and manual labourers, and between the rural peasantry and urban
proletariat.[^20] In
*"<a   href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">"Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution</a>*, he elaborated on the natural basis for communism,[^21]
depicting the formation of social organisation among animals through the
practice of mutual aid.[^22]

Reclus himself argued that environmental degradation caused by
industrialisation, exemplified to him by mass deforestation in the
Pacific Northwest, was characteristic of the "barbarity" of modern
civilisation, which he felt subordinated both workers and the
environment to the goal of capital accumulation.[^23] Reclus was also
one of the earliest figures to develop the idea of "total liberation",
directly comparing the exploitation of labour with cruelty to animals
and thus advocating for both human and animal rights.[^24]

Kropotkin and Reclus' synthesis of environmental and social justice
formed the foundation for eco-socialism, chiefly associated with
libertarian socialists who advocated for a "return to nature", such as
Robert Blatchford,
"<a   href="William_Morris.md" class="wikilink" title="William Morris">"William
Morris</a> and Henry Stephens Salt.[^25] Ecological aspects of anarchism
were also emphasised by
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a> and "<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">"Alexander Berkman</a>, who, drawing from the
work of Henry David Thoreau, conceived of anarchism as a means to
promote unity between humans and the natural world.[^26] These early
ecological developments in anarchism lay the foundations for the
elaboration of green anarchism in the 1960s, when it was first taken up
by figures within the
"<a   href="New_Left.md" class="wikilink" title="New Left">"New Left</a>.[^27]

## History

### Development in the 1960s-1970s

Green anarchism first emerged after the dawn of the Atomic Age, as
increasingly centralized governments brought with them a new host of
environmental and social issues.[^28] During the 1960s, the rise of the
environmental movement coincided with a concurrent revival of interest
in anarchism, leading to anarchists having a considerable influence on
the development of radical environmentalist thought.[^29]

Principles and practices that already formed the core of anarchist
philosophy, from direct action to community organizing, thus became
foundational to radical environmentalism.[^30] As the threats presented
by environmental degradation, industrial agriculture and pollution
became more urgent, the first green anarchists turned to
decentralisation and diversity as solutions for socio-ecological
systems.[^31]

Green anarchism as a tendency was first developed by the American social
anarchist "<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">"Murray Bookchin</a>.[^32] Bookchin had already
began addressing the problem of environmental degradation as far back as
the 1950s.[^33] In 1962, he published the first major modern work of
environmentalism, *Our Synthetic Environment*, which warned of the
ecological dangers of pesticide application.[^34] Over the subsequent
decades, Bookchin developed the first theory of green anarchism, social
ecology,[^35] which presented social hierarchy as the root of ecological
problems.[^36]

In 1973, Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss developed another green
anarchist tendency, known as deep ecology, which rejected of
anthropocentrism in favour of biocentrism.[^37] In 1985, this philosophy
was developed into a political programme by the American academics Bill
Devall and George Sessions, while Australian philosopher Warwick Fox
proposed the formation of bioregions as a green anarchist alternative to
the nation state.[^38]

### Anarcho-Primitivism

Following on from deep ecology,[^39] the next major development in green
anarchist philosophy was the articulation of anarcho-primitivism, which
was critical of agriculture, technology and civilisation.[^40] First
developed in the pages of the American anarchist magazine
*"<a   href="Fifth_Estate.md" class="wikilink" title="Fifth Estate">"Fifth
Estate</a>* during the mid-1980s, anarcho-primitivist theory was
developed by Fredy Perlman, David Watson,[^41] and particularly
"<a   href="John_Zerzan.md" class="wikilink" title="John Zerzan">"John
Zerzan</a>.[^42] It was later taken up by the American periodical *Green
Anarchy* and British periodical
*"<a   href="Green_Anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="Green Anarchist">"Green
Anarchist</a>*,[^43] and partly inspired groups such as the
"<a   href="Animal_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Animal Liberation Front">"Animal Liberation Front</a> (ALF),
"<a   href="Earth_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">"Earth Liberation Front</a> (ELF) and
Individualists Tending to the Wild (ITS).[^44]

### From Theory to Practice

By the 1970s, radical environmentalist groups had begun to carry out
direct action against nuclear power infrastructure, with mobilisations
of the anti-nuclear movement in France, Germany and the United States
providing a direct continuity between contemporary environmentalism and
the New Left of the 1960s.[^45]

In the 1980s, green anarchist groups such as
"<a   href="Earth_First!.md" class="wikilink" title="Earth First!">"Earth
First!</a> started taking direct action against deforestation, roadworks
and industrial agriculture.[^46] They called their sabotage actions
"monkey-wrenching", after Edward Abbey's 1984 novel *The Monkey Wrench
Gang*.[^47]

During the 1990s, the road protest movements in the United Kingdom and
Israel were also driven by eco-anarchists, while eco-anarchist action
networks such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and Earth Liberation
Front (ELF) first rose to prominence.[^48] Eco-anarchist actions have
included violent attacks, such as those carried out by cells of the
Informal Anarchist Federation (IAF) and Individualists Tending to the
Wild (ITS) against nuclear scientists and nanotechnology researchers
respectively.[^49]

### Anti-Globalisation Movement

As environmental degradation was accelerated by the rise of economic
globalisation and neoliberalism, green anarchists broadened their scope
of action from a specific environmentalist focus into one that agitated
for global justice.[^50] Green anarchists were instrumental in the
establishment of the anti-globalisation movement (AGM), as well as its
transformation into the subsequent global justice movement (GJM).[^51]

The AGM gained support in both the Global North and Global South, with
the "<a   href="Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista Army of National Liberation">"Zapatista Army of National
Liberation</a> (EZLN) becoming a key organisation within the
movement.[^52] It also gained a wide range of support from different
sectors of society, not only including activists from left-wing politics
or the environmental and peace movements, but also people from trade
unions, church groups and the agricultural sector. Trade unionists were
the most prominent presence at the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, even
outnumbering the environmentalists and anarchists.[^53]

Drawing from its anarchist roots, the AGM adopted a decentralised and
non-hierarchical model of horizontal organisation, embracing new
"anarchical" technologies such as the internet as a means to network and
communicate.[^54] Through the environmental and anti-globalisation
movements, contemporary anarchism was ultimately able to achieve a
"quasi-renaissance" in anarchist ideas, tendencies and modes of
organisation.[^55]

### Contemporary Theoretical Developments

Writers such as Murray Bookchin and Alan Carter have claimed
contemporary anarchism to be the only political movement capable of
addressing climate change.[^56] In his 1996 book *Ecology and
Anarchism*, British anthropologist Brian Morris argued that anarchism is
intrinsically environmentalist, as it shared the ecologist principles of
decentralisation, non-hierarchical social organisation and
interdependence.[^57]

By the 21st century, green anarchists had begun to move beyond the
previous century's divisions into social ecologist and
anarcho-primitivist camps, establishing a new body of theory that
rejected the dualisms of humanity against nature and civilisation
against wilderness.[^58] Drawing on the biocentric philosophy of deep
ecology, in 2006, Mark Somma called for a "revolutionary
environmentalism" capable of overthrowing capitalism, reducing
consumption and organising the conservation of biodiversity.[^59]

Somma championed a form of solidarity between humanity and the non-human
natural world, in a call that was taken up in 2009 by Steven Best, who
called for eco-anarchists to commit themselves to "total liberation" and
extend solidarity to animals.[^60] To Best, morality ought to be
extended to animals due to their sentience and capacity to feel pain; he
has called for the abolition of the hierarchy between humans and
animals, although he implicitly excludes non-sentient plants from this
moral consideration.[^61]

Drawing from eco-feminism, pattrice jones called for human solidarity
with both plants and animals, neither of which she considered to be
lesser than humans, even describing them as "natural anarchists" that do
not recognise or obey any government's laws.[^62]

In 2012, Jeff Shantz developed a theory of "green syndicalism", which
seeks to use of syndicalist models of workplace organisation to link the
labour movement with the environmental movement.[^63]

## Tendencies

### Social Ecology

The green anarchist theory of social ecology is based on an analysis of
the relationship between society and nature.[^64] Social ecology
considers human society to be both the cause of and solution to
environmental degradation, envisioning the creation of a rational and
ecological society through a process of sociocultural evolution.[^65]

Social ecologist Murray Bookchin saw society itself as a natural product
of evolution,[^66] which intrinsically tended toward ever-increasing
complexity and diversity.[^67] While he saw human society as having the
potential to become "nature rendered self-conscious",[^68] in *The
Ecology of Freedom*, Bookchin elaborated that the emergence of hierarchy
had given way to a disfigured form of society that was both ecologically
and socially destructive.[^69]

According to social ecology, the oppression of humans by humans directly
preceded the exploitation of the environment by hierarchical society,
which itself caused a vicious circle of increasing socio-ecological
devastation.[^70] Considering social hierarchy to go against the natural
evolutionary tendencies towards complexity and diversity,[^71] social
ecology concludes that oppressive hierarchies have to be abolished in
order to resolve the ecological crisis.[^72]

Bookchin thus proposed a decentralised system of direct democracy,
centred locally in the municipality, where people themselves could
participate in decision making.[^73] He envisioned a self-organized
system of popular assemblies to replace the state and re-educate
individuals into socially and ecologically-minded citizens.[^74]

### Deep Ecology

The theory of deep ecology rejects anthropocentrism in favour of
biocentrism, which recognizes the intrinsic value of all life,
regardless of its utility to humankind.[^75] Unlike social ecologists,
theorists of deep ecology considered human society to be incapable of
reversing environmental degradation and, as a result, proposed a drastic
reduction in world population.[^76]

The solutions to human overpopulation proposed by deep ecologists
included bioregionalism, which advocated the replacement of the nation
state with bioregions, as well as a widespread return to a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle.[^77] Some deep ecologists, including members
of Earth First!, have even welcomed the mass death caused by disease and
famine as a form of population control.[^78]

### Anarcho-Primitivism

The theory of anarcho-primitivism aims its critique at the emergence of
technology, agriculture and civilisation, which it considers to have
been the source of all social problems.[^79] According to American
primitivist theorist John Zerzan, it was the division of labour in
agricultural societies that had first given way to the social inequality
and alienation which became characteristic of modernity. As such, Zerzan
proposed the abolition of technology and science, in order for society
to be broken down and humans to return to a hunter-gather
lifestyle.[^80]

Libertarian socialists such as
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">"Noam
Chomsky</a> and Michael Albert have been critical of
anarcho-primitivism, with the former arguing that it would inevitably
result in genocide.[^81]

### Green Syndicalism

Green syndicalism, as developed by Graham Purchase and Judi Bari,[^82]
advocates for the unification of the labour movement with environmental
movement and for trade unions such as the
"<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">"Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) to adopt ecological concerns into their platforms.[^83]

Seeing workers' self-management as a means to address environmental
degradation, green syndicalism pushes for workers to agitate their
colleagues, sabotage environmentally destructive practices in their
workplaces, and form workers' councils. Green syndicalist Jeff Shantz
proposed that a free association of producers would be best positioned
to dismantle the industrial economy, through the decentralisation and
localisation of production.[^84]

In contrast to Marxism and anarcho-syndicalism, green syndicalism
opposes mass production and rejects the idea that the industrial economy
has a "liberatory potential"; but it also rejects the radical
environmentalist calls for a "complete, immediate break with
industrialism".[^85]

## Theory

Although a diverse body of thought, eco-anarchist theory has a
fundamental basis unified by certain shared principles.[^86]
Eco-anarchism considers there to be a direct connection between the
problems of environmental degradation and hierarchy, and maintains an
anti-capitalist critique of productivism and industrialism.[^87]
Emphasising decentralisation and community ownership, it also advocates
for the degrowth of the economy and the re-centring of social relations
around local communities and bioregions.[^88]

### Critique of Civilisation

Green anarchism traces the roots of all forms of oppression to the
widespread transition from hunting and gathering to sedentary
lifestyles.[^89] According to green anarchism, the foundation of
civilisation was defined by the extraction and importation of natural
resources, which led to the formation of hierarchy through capital
accumulation and the division of labour.[^90]

Green anarchists are therefore critical of civilisation and its
manifestations in globalized capitalism, which they consider to be
causing a societal and ecological collapse that necessitates a "return
to nature".[^91] Green anarchists uphold direct action as a form of
resistance against civilisation, which they wish to replace with a way
of simple living in harmony with nature. This may involve cultivating
self-sustainability, practising survivalism or rewilding.[^92]

### Decentralisation

Eco-anarchism considers the rise of states to be the primary cause of
environmental degradation, as states promote greater industrial
extraction and production as means to remain competitive with other
state powers, even at the expense of the environment.[^93] Drawing from
the ecological principle of "unity in diversity", eco-anarchism also
recognises humans as an intrinsic part of the ecosystem that they live
in and how their culture, history and language is shaped by their local
environments.[^94]

Eco-anarchists therefore argue for the abolition of states and their
replacement with stateless societies,[^95] upholding various forms of
localism and bioregionalism.[^96]

### Deindustrialisation

Ecological anarchism considers the exploitation of labour under
capitalism within a broader ecological context, holding that
environmental degradation is intrinsically linked with societal
oppression.[^97] As such, green anarchism is opposed to industrialism,
due to both its social and ecological affects.[^98]

## Criticism

While green anarchism has been influential in environmental movements,
it has faced criticism from various perspectives. Some Marxists and
other leftists have argued that certain green anarchist tendencies,
particularly anarcho-primitivism, are impractical and would lead to
massive human suffering if implemented.
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">"Noam
Chomsky</a> has specifically criticized anarcho-primitivism, arguing
that abandoning modern technology and returning to pre-agricultural
societies would result in the death of billions of people.[^99]

Deep ecology has been criticized for its focus on population reduction,
with critics arguing that some deep ecologists have advocated morally
problematic positions, such as welcoming disease and famine as forms of
population control.[^100]

There have also been internal debates within green anarchism about the
relationship between different tendencies. Social ecologists,
particularly Murray Bookchin, have been critical of deep ecology and
anarcho-primitivism, arguing that they fail to adequately address social
hierarchy as the root cause of environmental problems.
