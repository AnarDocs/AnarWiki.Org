The pendulum of power, in African foraging cultures, is an alternation
of men's and women's rituals that has the effect of ensuring gender
equality. The rituals often involve gender-bending components. The
pendulum of power was theorized by Morna Finnegan and expanded upon by
Camilla Power and other members of the Radical Anthropology Group.

Alternating rituals include the elima and molima among the Mbuti, the
maitoko and epeme among the Hadza, and Ngoku and Ejengi among the
Bayaka.

# Mbuti

Rituals theatrically reinforce gender egalitarianism. One game begins
with women playing against men in a tug-of-war match. When one side
starts to win, someone from the winning team runs and joins the other
side. In the end, neither side wins and people have changed their gender
multiple times.[^1] In another ritual called the honey bee dance, men
try to steal honey from women who guard it with torches and hot coals.
After the women invariably succeed in protecting the honey, an elder
woman concludes the game by presenting a leaf of honey to the men. This
ritual reminds the community that although men provide most of the honey
(as well as meat), they can never turn it into a form of economic
control since the women control foods' distribution.[^2]

The men's *molimo* and women's *elima* rituals produce a pendulum of
power, balancing against the power of the other and ensuring overall
egalitarianism.[^3]

# Hadza

Social egalitarianism is maintained through through a monthly *epeme*
dance. Two to three nights a month, when the moon isn't visible, all
members of the Hadza camp participate in the *epeme* ritual. One one
side of a barrier (sometimes made of bushes, and sometimes a hut wall),
women sing and gather with children. On the other side, men dance for
the well-being of their families. Anthropologists Bwire Kaare and James
Woodburn argue that the *epeme* ritual may be interpreted as a recurring
ceremonial reconciliation of men and women, and indeed all Hadza."[^4]

Girls and boys have complementary coming-of-age initiations. The girls'
initiation, called *maitoko*, is led entirely by women and girls, with
no direction or involvement from men. After their first menstruation, a
group of girls are circumcised early in the morning by a woman and
dressed in lavish bead decorations. For three days, the girls then
playfully chase the boys with whipping sticks. Anthropologist Camilla
Power writes, that the women's solidarity and endurance of this ritual
has the effect of "commanding respect" from the men.[^5] However, Kaare
and Woodburn reported in 1999, "There are at present some indications
that Hadza women may, on their own initiative, soon decide to give up
circumcision."[^6]

The male initiation ceremony, called the *maito*, was reported by
Woodburn in 1964 to occur after his first emission. According to
Marlowe, however, the *maito* ceremony occurred after a young man killed
his first large animal, usually at the age of 20 to 25. Some camps allow
teenagers to join, although Marlowe notes one instance of a 15 year-old
who, despite killing a large kudu, was deemed too young for initiation.
A young man who does not kill a large animal, and therefore *epeme*
hunter, may still marry and have the equal rights in the rest of society
but cannot eat the *epeme* meat. Once he reaches an age around 30 to 35,
he is accepted as an *epeme* man whether or not he has killed a large
animal.[^7]

# Bayaka

Bayaka women and men preserve gender egalitarianism through alternating
rituals. The men's ritual dance is called the *ejengi*, and the women's
is called *ngoku*. During the women's *ngoku* ritual, the women sing
songs playfully taunting the men. One song says, "The penis gives birth
to nothing, only urine!" Another says, "We the Yaka! We the Yaka! Twice
the intelligence \[of men\]!" Such songs place a check on the men's
ability to dominate. The men believe that the women's song and dance
draws in forest spirits and please the forest itself.[^8]

A courtship dance, called the *elande*, involves a line of men and a
line of women, each line making polyphonic noises. A girl goes over to
the men's line and strikes a boy. With him in pursuit, she runs back to
the women's line. The boy then strikes one of the girls, and she chases
him as he runs back to the men's line. The ritual culminates in communal
laughter.[^9]
