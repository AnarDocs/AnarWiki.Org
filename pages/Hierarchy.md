# Hierarchy

**Hierarchy** is a system of organization in which people, things, or
concepts are ranked in orders of importance, authority, or power. The
term derives from the Greek *hieros* (sacred) and *arche* (command),
originally referring to the ranked organization of religious
authorities.[^1]

From an
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
perspective, hierarchy represents a fundamental threat to human
<a href="freedom" class="wikilink" title="freedom">freedom</a> and
<a href="equality" class="wikilink" title="equality">equality</a>,
organizing society through relations of dominance and submission rather
than cooperation and
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.
Anarchists argue that hierarchy is not a natural or inevitable feature
of human society, but rather a social construct that can and should be
challenged and replaced with egalitarian forms of organization.

## Nature of Hierarchy

Hierarchy functions as a value system in which worth is measured by the
number of people and things one controls, and how well one obeys those
positioned above. Power is exerted downward through the social
structure, with everyone forced to accept and conform to the system by
everyone else. Individuals fear disobeying those above them because of
the accumulated power that can be brought against them, while
simultaneously fearing to abdicate power over those below them.[^2]

The anthropologist
<a href="David_Graeber" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a> argued that the concept of hierarchy as used in contemporary
social science often conflates two distinct logical operations: linear
ranking (where elements are arranged along a single scale of
superiority) and taxonomic classification (where categories are
organized by levels of inclusion). This conflation, popularized
particularly through the work of French anthropologist
<a href="Louis_Dumont" class="wikilink" title="Louis Dumont">Louis
Dumont</a>, has naturalized inequality by treating hierarchical
arrangements as inherently meaningful and legitimate rather than as
contingent results of power relations.[^3]

## Historical Development

### Origins

The development of hierarchy predates
<a href="agriculture" class="wikilink"
title="agriculture">agriculture</a> and
<a href="civilization" class="wikilink"
title="civilization">civilization</a>, appearing in some
<a href="hunter-gatherer" class="wikilink"
title="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> societies in embryonic
forms. Two major types of hierarchy evidenced among some foraging
peoples are
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
(male dominance) and gerontocracy (rule by elders).

Among the Aché of the Amazonian forests and the Aranda of central
Australia, gender divisions and male political dominance were
pronounced, with land ownership traced through patrilineal descent among
the Aranda. Gerontocracy was particularly developed among the Aranda,
with elder males accorded leadership positions and younger people
excluded from full participation in group affairs.[^4]

However, other hunter-gatherer groups demonstrated thoroughly
egalitarian social organization. The
<a href="Mbuti" class="wikilink" title="Mbuti">Mbuti</a> of the Ituri
forest in central Africa minimized gender distinctions, used
non-gendered familial labels, and organized society around five
autonomous age groups that held balanced power over one another. The
youth served as defenders of justice, while elders reconciled conflicts,
with no group holding permanent dominance over others.[^5]

### Development of Dynamic Hierarchies

The combination of patriarchy and gerontocracy created the first dynamic
hierarchies. An elite minority of male elders gained disproportionate
influence and the beginnings of political power, while the promise of
eventual inclusion into the elite encouraged younger males to cooperate
with hierarchical systems. Women, though never ascending to elite
status, could gain elevated status with age by participating in the
hierarchy.

Gerontocracy enabled rudimentary forms of policing in
<a href="stateless_society" class="wikilink"
title="stateless societies">stateless societies</a>. Age grades that
some groups used in libertarian ways became tools for political
authority in societies that subordinated young people to old. Youth
transformed from autonomous defenders of justice into enforcers of the
will of elders, turning the diffuse sanctions characteristic of anarchy
into something closer to centrally controlled state sanctions.[^6]

The development of segmentary lineages in which each grouping is headed
by a lineage father created paths for the development of government.
Unlike "Big Man" leadership, which remained unstable, segmentary
lineages combining patrilineality and gerontocracy allowed political
control over large populations through a hierarchy of leaders from minor
to major, with leadership becoming hereditary and prestigious lineages
taking on innate qualities of superiority.

### Agriculture and Civilization

Agriculture did not create hierarchy, as evidenced by the existence of
egalitarian horticultural and agricultural societies. Rather, hierarchy
results from social strategies, while agriculture and technological
progression allow nascent hierarchies to become more complex,
authoritarian, and violent. The military advantages inherent in
agriculture allowed civilization's more developed hierarchies to spread
through expanding nations and conquering armies.

In the Middle East, agriculture developed from complex foraging
strategies adopted by Natufian hunter-gatherers following climatic
changes that increased wild cereal and nut populations. When climate
changed again, some groups reverted to simple foraging while others
developed horticulture and agriculture. The critical choices of these
early agriculturalists were profoundly influenced by existing social
strategies. Patriarchal groups living in monogamous households were more
likely to develop individual property concepts, while gerontocratic
groups were more likely to tolerate and traditionalize social
inequality.[^7]

Communities already led by elites were more likely to pursue aggressive
strategies of competition and domination, as elites had the most to gain
and least to lose from warfare and increased production. While
communities could practice agriculture and retain cultures of consensus
and communalism, such communities did not participate in the resulting
arms race and were often conquered, allowing the ascendancy of
domination-based civilization.

## Forms and Manifestations

### Political Hierarchy

Political hierarchies organize governmental and state power through
ranked positions of authority. These range from local officials to
national leaders, with each level exercising control over those below
while submitting to those above. Political hierarchy creates what
anarchists view as illegitimate authority, where decisions affecting
communities are made by those removed from the consequences of their
choices.

### Economic Hierarchy

Economic hierarchies organize production and distribution through
relationships of employer and employee, owner and worker, manager and
managed. These hierarchies create class divisions based on control of
resources and means of production. Workers lack control over their labor
and its products, while owners and managers extract value from others'
work.

### Social Hierarchy

Social hierarchies create ranked categories of people based on
characteristics such as race, gender, age, religion, or other
identities. These hierarchies justify unequal treatment and access to
resources, with dominant groups claiming natural or divinely ordained
superiority over subordinate groups.

## Psychological and Cultural Effects

Hierarchical systems teach acceptance of authority figures from
childhood regardless of whether such authority serves individual or
collective interests. People learn to bow instinctively before anyone
claiming greater importance. This conditioning manifests in various
forms of oppression:

- <a href="Racism" class="wikilink" title="Racism">Racism</a> emerges
  from hierarchical thinking that ranks racial groups
- <a href="Classism" class="wikilink" title="Classism">Classism</a>
  values wealthy people over poor people
- <a href="Sexism" class="wikilink" title="Sexism">Sexism</a> places men
  above women
- <a href="Homophobia" class="wikilink" title="Homophobia">Homophobia</a>
  allows marginalized people to feel superior to someone

Power makes people cruel and heartless, while submission makes people
cowardly and compliant. Most people in hierarchical systems participate
in both domination and submission at different times.[^8]

Hierarchical values drive environmental destruction and animal
exploitation, as societies seek control over anything within reach at
any cost. These same values send people to war, fighting for power over
each other and creating weapons of ever-greater destructive capacity.

## Resistance and Alternatives

### Historical Examples

Throughout human history, societies have organized without hierarchical
authority. The bushmen of the Kalahari desert live together without
formal authorities, working together while granting each other freedom
and autonomy. Historical examples include anarchist pirate strongholds
that maintained egalitarian internal organization while defending
against external powers.

### Gender Resistance

Many societies developed practices specifically to prevent or resist
patriarchy. The Mbuti practiced gender-leveling rituals, including games
where participants repeatedly changed genders to exorcise gender
tensions. Igbo women practiced ritualized collective action including
all-night insult sessions and property destruction against men who
violated women's rights or infringed on women's economic spheres.[^9]

Early resistance to essentialized gender notions appeared in artwork
among hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists. San rock art and
paintings and figurines from around the world frequently contained
androgynous figures, encouraging fluidity in gender concepts by blurring
distinctions or presenting figures with simultaneously exaggerated
female and male characteristics.

### Contemporary Anarchist Practice

<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>
represents both a rejection of hierarchy and a positive vision of
egalitarian organization. Rather than conceiving anarchism solely as a
large-scale political program, it can be understood as an individual
orientation and personal approach to life. This involves:

- Thinking for oneself rather than following blindly
- Rejecting the authority of nations, laws, or other forces as more
  significant than personal autonomy
- Distrusting those who claim rank or status above others
- Refusing to place responsibility for oneself in others' hands
- Demanding that each person be able to choose their own destiny

Anarchist practice appears in everyday life whenever people make
decisions for themselves, take responsibility for their own actions
rather than deferring to higher powers, and work out coexistence with
others directly rather than depending on external rules.[^10]

## Anarchist Opposition

Anarchists oppose all forms of hierarchy, both moral and material,
countering with respect for individual freedom and absolute autonomy. In
anarchist visions of future society, every human being would have rights
equal to those of their contemporaries.

The anarchist opposition to hierarchy recognizes that domination-based
civilizations spread not through freely chosen assurances of material
improvement, but through military advantages and the imperative to
dominate hardwired into such systems. While domination-based
civilizations easily subjugated surrounding societies, they remain
vulnerable to internal tensions arising from subjects' reasonable
antagonism toward dominating power structures.[^11]

Anarchists argue that oppressive hierarchies are not inherent to any
material modes of existence humans would freely choose, but rather allow
technologies to become oppressive while defining the range of complexity
hierarchies can develop. Hierarchies foster their own reproduction
partly through development of implicitly oppressive technologies.
However, hierarchies fall within the range of possible human behavior
and can be prevented when understood as threats to human freedom and
wellbeing.

## Contemporary Analysis

The widespread adoption of "hierarchy" as the preferred term for
describing unequal social arrangements represents a significant shift in
social science vocabulary. Where earlier anthropologists used terms like
"rank," "dominance," "social stratification," or simply "inequality,"
contemporary usage increasingly defaults to "hierarchy." This linguistic
shift reflects a broader transformation toward intellectualizing social
life and treating power relations as always already legitimate rather
than requiring justification.[^12]

This shift has made it difficult to write genuinely critical analyses of
social stratification, as labeling power relations as "hierarchy"
already implies they are considered legitimate by those involved. The
question of how hierarchy becomes seen as legitimate appears almost
redundant when the term itself assumes legitimacy as inherent in
hierarchical arrangements.
