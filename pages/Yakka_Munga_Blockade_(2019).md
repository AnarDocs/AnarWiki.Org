## Background

Aboriginal Australians had been pretty brutally treated by the colonial
government of the
"<a   href="British_Empire.md" class="wikilink" title="British Empire">"British
Empire</a>, stealing and enclosing aboriginal land and wiping out 98% of
the population. After Australia's independence in 1901, there were
apartheid-esque conditions for aboriginals (many also being pushed into
slavery and/or massacred by police) but even after the aboriginal rights
movement, they still face a lot of discrimination, being vilified or
fetished in white Australian culture, harassed by police and abused by
corporations for cheap labour.

The Yakka Munga site contained several sacred aboriginal artifacts and
had been sold off to Chinese investors as a cattle site (harming the
region ecologically), land clearing (of 24km by 50 meters) had been
destroying some of the few sacred sites left and the company acted
without the consent of the aboriginal land council.[^1]

## Events

Aboriginal protesters physically blocked the site in a picket, stopping
trucks carrying workers from entering.[^2]

## Results

The Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation
issued a stop work order to the company, the campaign was thus
successful.[^3]
