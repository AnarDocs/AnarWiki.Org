**r/Anarchy101** is an educational
"<a   href="subreddit.md" class="wikilink" title="subreddit">subreddit</a> on
"<a   href="Reddit.md" class="wikilink" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> dedicated to
answering questions about
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
theory, practice, and history. Created on January 3, 2011, the forum
serves as an accessible entry point for individuals seeking to learn
about
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>,
regardless of their current level of knowledge.

## Overview

The subreddit operates as a question-and-answer platform where users can
inquire about any aspect of anarchism without fear of judgment. As of
October 2025, r/Anarchy101 receives approximately 45,000 weekly visitors
and 1,200 weekly contributions, making it one of the more active
anarchist online communities.[^1]

The forum's primary purpose is educational rather than argumentative.
Users are explicitly instructed not to engage in debate or post
antagonistically, as the subreddit is "only intended for educational
discussion, not to 'disprove' anarchism."[^2] Those interested in
debating anarchist principles are directed to r/DebateAnarchism instead.

## Guidelines and Culture

r/Anarchy101 operates under several foundational principles that shape
its community culture:

### Educational Focus

The subreddit maintains a strict educational mandate. No question is
considered too basic or too advanced, and the community actively
discourages downvoting or criticizing questions that may appear simple.
This approach creates an environment where learning is prioritized over
gatekeeping.

### Anti-Capitalist and Anti-State Foundation

A core premise of the subreddit is that all anarchists are
"<a   href="anti-capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> and
"<a   href="anti-state.md" class="wikilink" title="anti-state">anti-state</a>.
This foundational assumption is not subject to debate within the forum
and serves as the baseline for all discussions.[^3]

### Community Moderation

Users are encouraged to report comments that are antagonistic, rude,
oppressive, or clearly incorrect. This community-driven moderation helps
maintain the educational atmosphere and ensures that information shared
remains accurate and respectful.

## Resources

The subreddit maintains a wiki at
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/wiki/index/> which provides
supplementary educational materials. The wiki includes:

- A suggested reading list featuring foundational anarchist texts
- Information about actions and projects for individuals interested in
  engaging with "<a   href="anarchist_praxis.md" class="wikilink"
  title="anarchist praxis">anarchist praxis</a>
- Additional resources for deepening understanding of anarchist theory
  and practice

## Relation to Other Platforms

r/Anarchy101 should not be confused with anarchy101.org, a separate (now
defunct) website that previously served educational purposes within the
anarchist community. The subreddit remains independent from this earlier
project, though both shared similar educational goals.
