# Conservatism

**Conservatism** is a political philosophy that emerged in the late 18th
century as a response to revolutionary movements in America, Britain,
and France. While often characterized as seeking to "conserve"
traditional values and institutions, anarchist analysis suggests
conservatism primarily functions to preserve existing power structures
and social hierarchies.

## Historical Origins

Conservatism as a formal political philosophy was largely developed by
<a href="Edmund_Burke.md" class="wikilink" title="Edmund Burke">Edmund
Burke</a> (1729-1797), an Irish-born British statesman and philosopher.
Burke supported the American and British revolutions but opposed the
<a href="French_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, writing *Reflections on
the Revolution in France* (1790) as a critique of radical social
change.[^1] His opposition centered not on revolution itself, but on
revolutions that threatened established aristocratic and mercantile
interests.

Burke's pamphlet provoked immediate responses from
<a href="Mary_Wollstonecraft.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, who wrote
*<a href="A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Men.md" class="wikilink"
title="A Vindication of the Rights of Men">A Vindication of the Rights
of Men</a>* (1790), and
<a href="Thomas_Paine.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas
Paine</a>, who published *<a href="The_Rights_of_Man.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Rights of Man">The Rights of Man</a>* (1791).[^2][^3] Both
authors challenged Burke's defense of inherited privilege and exclusion
of women and the poor from political participation.

The term "conservative" was first used in a political context in France
with the establishment of the *Sénat conservateur* in 1799 following
<a href="Napoleon_Bonaparte.md" class="wikilink"
title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>'s coup. This
conservative senate consisted of 60 members appointed for life, each
receiving substantial allowances.[^4]

## Relationship to Capitalism

Burke explicitly connected conservatism with emerging
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
economic structures, declaring that "The laws of commerce are the laws
of Nature, and therefore the laws of God."[^5]
<a href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
later criticized Burke's philosophical justifications as self-serving,
noting that Burke "always sold himself in the best market."[^6]

## Anarchist Critique

From an anarchist perspective, conservatism functions primarily as an
ideology of **privilege preservation** rather than genuine tradition or
moral values. This analysis challenges common conservative
self-descriptions:

### Selective Traditionalism

Conservative appeals to tradition are highly selective, typically
defending only those traditions that support existing power structures
while ignoring pre-hierarchical social arrangements or environmental
stewardship practices.

### Freedom and Authority

Conservative concepts of freedom often prioritize the liberty of
property owners while restricting the freedoms of those without economic
power. This creates a hierarchy where freedom becomes proportional to
wealth and social status.

### Merit and Inheritance

The conservative simultaneous support for "meritocracy" and inherited
wealth reveals an internal contradiction. If hard work and merit
determine success, inherited advantages undermine this principle by
providing unearned head starts to some while creating structural
disadvantages for others.

## Contemporary Analysis

Modern conservatism continues to function as a defense of established
hierarchies, whether economic, social, or political. The ideology's
flexibility allows it to adapt to changing circumstances while
maintaining its core function of privilege preservation.

Conservative movements consistently oppose redistributive policies that
would equalize opportunities, while supporting policies that maintain or
expand advantages for already-privileged groups. This pattern suggests
that conservatism's primary function is not the preservation of abstract
values but the maintenance of concrete power relationships.

## Relationship to Anarchism

Anarchist theory views conservatism as fundamentally opposed to genuine
human liberation, as it seeks to preserve the very hierarchical
structures that anarchism aims to dismantle. While anarchists may share
some conservative concerns about rapid social change or community bonds,
they reject conservative solutions that maintain or strengthen authority
structures.

The conservative emphasis on
<a href="hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>,
<a href="authority.md" class="wikilink" title="authority">authority</a>,
and <a href="privilege.md" class="wikilink" title="privilege">privilege</a>
directly contradicts anarchist principles of mutual aid, horizontal
organization, and the abolition of domination.
