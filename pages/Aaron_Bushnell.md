## Biography

Aaron grew up in Orleans, Massachusetts, in a religious community known
as the Community of Jesus, which his friends later described as a
cult.[^1] According to testimonies from close friends, Bushnell was
deeply traumatized by his upbringing, where he was kept constantly busy
with unpaid labor, intensive training for performance arts programs, and
worship. The community operated through shame, guilt, and the threat of
ostracization. Despite this difficult beginning, Bushnell managed to
leave the community in 2019.[^2]

Bushnell joined the United States Air Force in May 2020. He completed
Basic and Technical Training and specialized in cybersecurity as a
Client Systems Technician. He later worked as a DevOps engineer in San
Antonio, Texas, while pursuing an undergraduate degree in software
engineering from Southern New Hampshire University.[^3]

During his time in the military, Bushnell underwent a process of
self-education that led him to anarchist politics. He actively
participated in mutual aid work, particularly supporting unhoused
people, which reflected his deeply held anarchist principles.[^4]

### Political Development

Bushnell identified as an anarchist, which to him meant "believing in
the abolition of all hierarchical power structures, especially
capitalism and the state." In a document he prepared for a mutual aid
group in San Antonio, he explained that he viewed their work as
"fighting back in the class war which the capitalist class wages on the
rest of humanity." He favored consensus-based decision-making over
voting-based governance and sought to engage in "egalitarian forms of
organizing that produce horizontal power structures based on mutual aid
and solidarity."[^5]

Friends described Bushnell as intensely principled. He refused to use
words with ableist or misogynist origins, constantly reflected on and
changed his behavior to be more considerate of others, and was deeply
troubled by hierarchical relationships. His upbringing in a cult-like
environment gave him a unique perspective on mainstream society,
allowing him to recognize what one friend described as "the latent
fascist logic and cult-like tendencies that we swim through every
day."[^6]

According to his friends, following the police murder of George Floyd,
Bushnell became more open in his objections to the military.[^7] His
Reddit posts in the months before his death showed his strong opposition
to Israel's actions in Gaza. He described Israel as a "settler
colonialist apartheid state" and referred to Hamas as an "anti-colonial
resistance organization."[^8]

### Mutual Aid Work

Bushnell was deeply committed to mutual aid, particularly in support of
unhoused people. In his own words:

"I've always been bothered by the reality of homelessness, even back
when I was growing up in a conservative community. I have come to
believe in the importance of solidarity politics and I view the
enforcement of homelessness as a major front in the class war which must
be challenged for all our sakes. I view helping my houseless neighbors
as a moral obligation, a matter of social justice, and a matter of good
politics. If I don't stand with those more marginalized than me today
then who will be left to stand with me tomorrow."[^9]

He also stated: "I view enforced homelessness as a societal failing and
a crime against humanity. I believe that no one deserves to be deprived
of basic human necessities. I believe that homelessness as an
involuntary condition must be abolished."[^10]

He was an active member of San Antonio Collective Care and later
participated in Serve the People Akron, where he was described as
"dependable and persistent with the mutual aid work he did in a city
that was still new to him."[^11]

## Self-Immolation Protest

### Context and Preparation

Bushnell's act of self-immolation took place in the context of the
ongoing Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which by February 2024 had
killed over 30,000 Palestinians, including more than 12,000 children,
and destroyed the majority of inhabitable buildings and hospitals in
Gaza.[^12] The United States government continued to provide weapons,
financing, and diplomatic support to Israel throughout this campaign.

Before his self-immolation, Bushnell drafted a will that left
instructions for his savings to be donated to the Palestine Children's
Relief Fund.[^13] In his will, he wrote: "I am sorry to my brother and
my friends for leaving you like this. Of course, if I was truly sorry, I
wouldn't be doing it. But the machine demands blood. None of this is
fair." He also expressed a wish for his ashes to be scattered "in a free
Palestine" if that possibility ever arose.[^14]

On the morning of February 25, 2024, Bushnell posted a message on
Facebook: "Many of us like to ask ourselves, 'What would I do if I was
alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I
do if my country was committing genocide?' The answer is, you're doing
it. Right now."[^15] He also sent a message to media outlets: "Today, I
am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide
of the Palestinian people."[^16]

### The Event

</figure>

At approximately 12:58 p.m. local time on February 25, 2024, Bushnell,
dressed in military fatigues, approached the Israeli Embassy in
Washington, D.C. He had created a Twitch account under the name
"LillyAnarKitty" with a Palestinian flag as his profile banner and an
anarchist circle-A symbol as his profile picture.[^17] While
live-streaming, he walked towards the embassy and said:

"I am an active duty member of the United States Air Force. And I will
no longer be complicit in genocide. I am about to engage in an extreme
act of protest. But compared to what people have been experiencing in
Palestine at the hands of their colonizers—it's not extreme at all. This
is what our ruling class has decided will be normal."[^18]

Outside the embassy, Bushnell placed his camera down, positioned himself
in front of the gates, and poured a flammable liquid over himself. After
igniting himself, he repeatedly shouted "Free Palestine!" until he
collapsed to the ground.[^19] Security officers responded to the scene,
and Bushnell was transported to a local hospital, where he was declared
dead approximately seven hours later.[^20]

### Final Communications

Shortly before his self-immolation, Bushnell contacted the anarchist
collective CrimethInc, asking them to "make sure that the footage is
preserved and reported on."[^21] He also deleted his Signal account,
which his friends described as "a last act of security and love for his
comrades."[^22]

## Reactions and Impact

### Solidarity Actions

Following Bushnell's death, vigils were held in multiple American
cities. On February 26, over 100 people attended a vigil in his memory
in front of the Israeli embassy.[^23] Some vigils were organized by the
anti-war group Code Pink.[^24]

On February 28, a vigil was held outside the Wyatt Federal Building in
Portland, Oregon, by the advocacy group About Face: Veterans Against the
War, where multiple veterans burned their military clothing in front of
a banner reading "Veterans say: Free Palestine! Remember Aaron
Bushnell."[^25]

Officials in the Palestinian city of Jericho announced on March 10 that
they had named a street in Bushnell's honor.[^26]

### Political Responses

Several political figures issued statements about Bushnell's
self-immolation. Senator Bernie Sanders called it "a terrible tragedy"
that "speaks to the depths of despair that so many people are feeling
now about the horrific humanitarian disaster taking place in Gaza."[^27]

By contrast, Senator Tom Cotton proposed two bills that would revoke the
security clearances of people who express support for foreign terrorist
organizations and ban military service members from participating in
protests.[^28]

Palestinian organizations, including Hamas and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, issued statements honoring Bushnell. Hamas
expressed "heartfelt condolences" to his friends and family, stating
that he "immortalised his name as a defender of human values and the
oppression of the suffering Palestinian people."[^29] The PFLP called
his suicide "the highest sacrifice."[^30]

### Media Coverage and Criticisms

Some critics of mainstream media coverage pointed out attempts to
"discredit" or "dilute" Bushnell's explicitly political motives. Al
Jazeera columnist Belén Fernández criticized *The New York Times* for
not mentioning Bushnell's motive in the title of its report.[^31] *The
Guardian* argued that pro-Israel news outlets implied without evidence
that Bushnell was mentally ill, while his friends directly contradicted
this assertion.[^32]

### Similar Actions

Bushnell's act was the second self-immolation protesting United States
support for Israel in the Gaza war. In December 2023, another protester
had set themselves on fire at the Israeli consulate in Atlanta,
Georgia.[^33]

Later in 2024, two more similar incidents occurred:

- On September 11, 2024, Matt Nelson set himself on fire near the
  Israeli consulate in Boston. He died from his injuries on September
  15.[^34]
- On October 5, 2024, Samuel Mena Jr., who identified himself as a
  journalist, set his arm on fire in front of the White House. He
  survived with non-life-threatening injuries.[^35]

## Remembrances from Friends

Friends of Bushnell describe him as kind, compassionate, and deeply
principled. One friend, identified only as "T Bear," said:

"He was incredibly committed to developing relationships based on deep
trust and understanding—and would be the first to give you the raised
brows for a snarky answer to an important question. He never let a
potential harm go unaddressed. He embodied more than anyone I know the
anarchist spirit, 'that deeply human sentiment, which aims at the good
of all, freedom and justice for all, solidarity and love among the
people.'"[^36]

Another friend, identified as "Moon," stated:

"Aaron himself was a principled, strong-willed man. He was keenly aware
of hierarchical relationships due to his experiences growing up, and
consistently pushed back on any potential hierarchies in our day-to-day
organizing. He was steadfast, and I respected that greatly. He taught me
so much about how to build my position, and the importance of building
your own positions—because it does inform the work that you do and the
organizing that you do."[^37]

A third friend, identified as "E," described Aaron as someone who "was
kind, compassionate, and principled, sometimes to the point of being
annoying, and he was incredibly reflective and willing to change to meet
my needs in our relationship." They added:

"Aaron saw hierarchy and injustice and his role in those systems and
hated it... He had so much love for his cats. The contradictions of
owning someone you love weighed on him heavily. He was constantly
thinking of how to best accommodate them and navigate this relationship
of domination, complete control of their agency. I saw how it genuinely
distressed him."[^38]

## Legacy and Anarchist Perspective

While many mainstream commentators condemned Bushnell's action or
attributed it to mental illness, anarchists and other radicals have
emphasized the political nature of his decision. His self-immolation
raises important questions about the limits of conventional protest in
the face of ongoing genocide and the moral responsibility of individuals
living within imperialist nations.

As his friend "Moon" reflected:

"From Aaron's sacrifice, I would like to bring attention to the risk
that many of us face in the imperial core: complacency. We organize in
the streets, get ignored, and then become complacent and further
complicit. Let us not forget that we live in a settler-colonial society
here as well—many of us are settlers—and we are also complicit in the
genocide of our colonized neighbors, native Indigenous and Black people.
We need to organize for long-term community building, long-term action,
and sustainable radical action. The purpose of building social
institutions is to keep momentum going so that no one ever feels the
need to make a sacrifice like this again."[^39]

CrimethInc wrote that "Aaron's action challenges us to answer this
question—and to answer it differently than he did," referring to the
question of what actions might effectively pressure the US government to
end its support for Israel's assault on Gaza.[^40]

While Bushnell's act represents an extreme form of political protest
that many would not choose to emulate, his life and death serve as a
powerful reminder of the human cost of complicity with systems of
oppression, and the strength of conviction that can drive individuals to
take extraordinary actions in solidarity with those suffering under
those systems.
