# Soviets

A **soviet** (Russian: совет, *sovet*, meaning "council") is a workers'
council that emerged as a form of direct democratic organization during
the Russian revolutionary period. While the term became associated with
the authoritarian Soviet Union, the original soviets represented genuine
experiments in workers' self-management and direct democracy that were
gradually subordinated and ultimately destroyed by the Bolshevik state
by 1930.

## Origins

### Traditional Peasant Communes

The concept of collective councils had deep roots in Russian society.
Traditional peasant communes known as **mir** or **obshchina** had
existed in Russia for centuries before the 1917 Revolution. These were
village communities where land was held collectively and periodically
redistributed among member families according to their needs. The mir
operated through village assemblies (**skhod**) where decisions were
made collectively, representing a form of peasant self-governance that
predated industrial workers' councils.

### 1905 Revolution

The first industrial workers' soviets emerged during the 1905
Revolution. According to Soviet historiography, the first workers'
council formed in May 1905 in Ivanovo during strikes in the textile
industry.[^1] However, anarchist historian Voline claimed to have
witnessed the beginnings of the St Petersburg Soviet in January
1905.[^2]

These early soviets arose organically from workers' struggles,
representing an autonomous workers' movement that broke free from
government oversight. Soviets sprang up throughout Russia's industrial
centers, typically organizing at the factory level. The primary actors
in these councils were revolutionary socialists and anarchists, with
Lenin's Bolshevik party representing only a minority faction.[^3]

These soviets established minor worker cooperatives and engaged
primarily in direct action against the Tsarist regime. However, they
were suppressed after the revolution's defeat and disappeared until
re-emerging in 1917.

## 1917 Revolution and Bolshevik Takeover

### February Revolution

During the February Revolution of 1917, soviets re-emerged throughout
Russia as "Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies." These bodies
initially operated alongside the Russian Provisional Government in a
system of dual power. The Petrograd Soviet, with 4,000 members, became
the most important due to its position in the capital and influence over
the garrison.[^4]

Initially, these soviets were dominated by the Socialist Revolutionary
Party and Mensheviks, with Bolsheviks holding a minority position. The
soviets were politically open and inclusive entities. As John Reed
documented, "Until February 1918 anybody could vote for delegates to the
Soviets. Even had the bourgeoisie organised and demanded representation
in the Soviets, they would have been given it."[^5]

Vladimir Lenin himself acknowledged this political openness, writing in
1918 that "the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie is not a necessary
and indispensable feature of the dictatorship of the proletariat" and
that the Bolsheviks "did not say anything in advance about
disenfranchising the exploiters."[^6] According to Lenin, the exclusion
of the bourgeoisie from soviets "emerged of itself in the course of the
struggle" rather than according to any predetermined plan.[^7]

### October Revolution

The Bolsheviks gradually gained support in the soviets as World War I
continued and the Provisional Government proved unable to address
workers' demands. The Bolsheviks campaigned under the slogan "All Power
to the Soviets," promising workers a government run by workers' councils
that would overthrow the bourgeois Provisional Government.

In October 1917, the Bolsheviks led an uprising that overthrew the
Provisional Government, claiming to transfer all power to the soviets.
However, this marked the beginning of the soviets' transformation from
organs of workers' self-management into instruments of Bolshevik party
control.

## Erosion of Soviet Autonomy

### Early Restrictions

The autonomous character of the soviets began eroding almost immediately
after the Bolshevik seizure of power. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks
established a code governing soviet elections that disqualified entire
classes of people from voting, including "those who employ others for
profit; those who live on incomes not derived from their own work;
private business men, agents, middlemen; monks and priests of all
denominations; ex-employees of the old police services and members of
the Romanov dynasty."[^8]

This represented a fundamental departure from the inclusive character of
the early soviets, where political participation had been open to all.

### Factory Committees and Workers' Control

Immediately after the October Revolution, workers took the Bolshevik
slogan "All Power to the Soviets" at face value and organized Factory
Committees to run industrial plants democratically. These committees
represented direct workers' control over production, with workers
electing their own management and making decisions collectively about
factory operations.

In his March 7, 1918 "Report on War and Peace," Lenin appeared to
endorse this autonomous activity, stating: "The workers are building the
new world... and we find that at every step, hundreds of thousands of
people are constantly coming to us with questions... They say: 'Tell us
how to run the factories, tell us how to organize the village.' And we
have to tell them: you are the power, do it yourselves."[^9] However,
workers were not asking Lenin for permission or direction—they were
already managing factories themselves, often having dismissed their
former managers. Lenin's rhetorical support masked a growing tension
between genuine workers' self-management and Bolshevik demands for
centralized control.

By early 1918, Lenin reversed course, declaring that "unlimited power"
for local factory committees was "harmful" to production. The Bolsheviks
moved to subordinate the committees to state-controlled trade unions and
replaced democratic workers' control with **edinonachalie** (one-man
management), where single managers appointed by the state commanded
workers rather than being accountable to them.

Lenin justified this shift by arguing that modern industrial production
required hierarchical discipline: "Large-scale machine industry... calls
for absolute and strict unity of will... How can strict unity of will be
ensured? By thousands subordinating their will to the will of one."[^10]

Historians including S.A. Smith and Maurice Brinton have documented that
the economic disruption of 1917-1918 often resulted from the state's
efforts to break local self-management rather than from failures of
workers' control itself.[^11][^12]

### May 1918: Abolition of Local Soviet Autonomy

A critical turning point came on May 27, 1918. When local Soviets in
Saratov, Samara, Simbirsk, and other areas abolished fixed prices and
restored free trade in response to food shortages, Moscow responded with
a decree abolishing the autonomy of local Soviets and concentrating
power in the central Food Commissariat. This represented one of the
first major blows to local self-governance, demonstrating that the
Bolshevik government would not tolerate soviets acting independently of
central directives.

### War Communism (1918-1921)

During the War Communism period, the autonomy of both urban and rural
soviets was systematically dismantled:

**Urban Soviets:** Factory and workers' soviets were increasingly
subordinated to state-appointed managers and party officials. The role
of elected delegates shifted from determining policy to implementing
decisions made by the Bolshevik party hierarchy.

**Rural Soviets:** The traditional mir assemblies and peasant communes
faced even more severe attacks:

- **Forced grain requisitioning** (prodrazvyorstka) stripped communes of
  control over their agricultural output
- The creation of **Committees of Poor Peasants** deliberately divided
  village communities and undermined traditional commune authority
- A centralized food dictatorship gave state officials power to seize
  grain by force from peasant communes

During 1917-18, village gatherings and land communes had actually led
the agrarian revolution and land seizures, demonstrating genuine peasant
self-organization. However, these traditional assemblies were
increasingly bypassed or overridden by party-appointed officials who
answered to Moscow rather than local communities.

### Party Dominance

By the early 1920s, the soviets had been transformed into a hierarchical
structure controlled by the Communist Party. The organs of the Communist
Party (particularly the Central Committee) made all significant policy
decisions, while the soviets functioned merely as a system for public
approval of implementing the Party's program. Lenin himself acknowledged
this reality in 1919, stating: "Our Soviets are in name organs of
government by the working people; in point of fact, they are organs of
government for the working people, by the advanced section of the
proletariat, but not by the working people as a whole."[^13]

**The Kronstadt Uprising**

The most dramatic demonstration of the gap between Bolshevik rhetoric
and reality came with the Kronstadt Uprising of March 1921. The sailors
and workers of Kronstadt had been among the most militant supporters of
the October Revolution, celebrated by the Bolsheviks as the "pride and
joy" of the revolution. However, by 1921 these same sailors and workers
rebelled against Bolshevik rule, demanding "Soviets without
Communists"—that is, the free and democratic workers' councils that
Lenin had promised in 1917. The Kronstadt rebels did not seek a return
to Tsarism or capitalism; they wanted to restore genuine soviet
democracy and end the Bolshevik party's monopoly on power.

Lenin's government declared the Kronstadt rebels
"counter-revolutionaries" allegedly led by French spies. The Red Army,
led by Trotsky, was sent across the ice to crush the uprising. Thousands
of sailors and workers were killed in the assault, and many survivors
faced execution or imprisonment in concentration camps.[^14]

The suppression of Kronstadt—carried out by the same Bolshevik leaders
who had promised "All Power to the Soviets"—demonstrated conclusively
that the soviets had become instruments of party dictatorship rather
than organs of workers' power.

**Formalization of Party Control**

The "soviet system" became a pyramid of local, district, regional, and
national soviets, each subordinate to the next higher level and all
ultimately controlled by the party apparatus. The 1936 Constitution
formalized this relationship, declaring the Communist Party the "leading
nucleus of all organisations of workers, whether public or state,"
making explicit what had long been the reality: the soviets were
instruments of party rule, not organs of workers' self-management.

## Final Destruction: 1930 Collectivization

The traditional peasant communes (mir or obshchina) that had survived
the initial years of Bolshevik rule were formally abolished on July 10,
1930, as part of Stalin's collectivization campaign. The Central
Committee decree abolished the communes in collectivized areas,
replacing them with kolkhozes (collective farms) and sovkhozes (state
farms) directly controlled by the state.

Unlike the traditional communes where peasants retained some degree of
collective self-governance, the new collective farms were
state-controlled agricultural enterprises where the government dictated
production quotas, controlled resources, and appointed leadership.
Peasants who resisted collectivization faced deportation, imprisonment,
or execution.

In this sense, the "Union of Soviets" existed in any meaningful form for
at most eight years (1922-1930), and it is arguable whether genuine
soviet power ever existed after the Bolshevik consolidation of control
in 1918-1921.

## Anarchist Analysis

From an anarchist perspective, the fate of the soviets demonstrates the
inherent dangers of centralized revolutionary leadership and the
incompatibility between genuine workers' self-management and state
power.

The original soviets of 1905 and early 1917 represented authentic organs
of workers' and peasants' power, emerging organically from struggles and
operating through direct democracy and recallable delegates. However,
the Bolshevik party's insistence on seizing state power and establishing
a "dictatorship of the proletariat" necessarily required subordinating
these autonomous bodies to central control.

The Bolshevik model replaced horizontal coordination between workers'
councils with vertical hierarchy commanded by the party. What began as
organs of direct democracy became transmission belts for party
directives. The promise of "All Power to the Soviets" became a reality
of all power to the party apparatus.

This trajectory was not accidental but flowed from fundamental Bolshevik
commitments to centralized party leadership, state control of the
economy, and the belief that a vanguard party must direct the working
class. Anarchists argued at the time—and the historical record
confirms—that authentic workers' self-management cannot coexist with
state power, regardless of the state's claimed revolutionary
credentials.

## Soviets Outside Russia

Despite their suppression in the Soviet Union, the soviet model inspired
workers' councils in other countries:

### Poland

Workers' councils (rady delegatów robotniczych or rady robotnicze)
formed in Poland during the 1905 Revolution, when workers in Congress
Poland took control of factories and sometimes entire towns until
Tsarist authorities crushed the rebellion.

In 1918-1919, over 100 workers' councils operated in newly independent
Poland, assembling around 500,000 workers and peasants. The most
numerous and radical councils were located in Kraśnik, Lublin, Płock,
Warsaw, Zamość, and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie. Although some councils formed
self-defense units, they were dismantled by July 1919 through government
suppression and withdrawal of support from the reformist Polish
Socialist Party.[^15]

Workers' councils reappeared in Poland during the Poznań protests of
1956, in 1970, and during the Solidarity movement of 1980-1981.[^16]

### Germany

Following World War I, a Bavarian Soviet Republic was established in
April 1919 by workers in Bavaria. The short-lived soviet republic
represented an attempt to implement workers' council governance in
Germany. However, on May 1, 1919, the German Army and local Freikorps
violently overthrew the republic, massacring several hundred people in
the process.[^17]

### Ireland

The Limerick Soviet was formed in Ireland in 1919 at the beginning of
the Irish War of Independence. It represented one of several Irish
soviets where workers took control of towns and workplaces,
demonstrating the international appeal of the soviet model as a form of
workers' organization.[^18]

### China

After the Nanchang uprising, the Chinese Communist Party established
soviet-style governance in areas under its control during the 1920s.
These were declared the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931, which served as
a precursor to the eventual establishment of the People's Republic of
China. The CSR was dissolved in 1937 when the CCP joined the Second
United Front with the Kuomintang.

## Legacy

The history of the soviets illustrates both the potential and the
limitations of workers' councils as revolutionary organizations. At
their best, the early soviets demonstrated that workers could organize
production and society through direct democracy and mutual aid, without
capitalist bosses or state bureaucrats.

However, their rapid subordination to the Bolshevik party demonstrates
that revolutionary organizations must remain truly autonomous and
horizontally organized to avoid being captured by would-be rulers. The
transformation of soviets from organs of workers' power into instruments
of state control remains a cautionary tale about the dangers of
revolutionary parties that seek to lead rather than serve workers'
movements.

Contemporary anarchists and libertarian socialists continue to draw on
the example of the early soviets while learning from their fate,
advocating for workers' councils that maintain genuine autonomy and
resist all attempts at hierarchical control—whether by capitalists,
state bureaucrats, or revolutionary parties.
