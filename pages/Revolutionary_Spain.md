title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>. The extent,
effectiveness, sustainability, economics, implications and lessons of
the revolution have been heavily studied and debated since the 1930s.

## Background

The revolution emerged from decades of anarchist organizing in Spain.
The <a href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT), founded in 1910, had grown to 1.5 million members by
1936. Spanish anarchists had maintained a systematic culture of
discussion, debate and preparation for revolution through newspapers,
pamphlets, books, trade union meetings and affinity groups since the
1870s.[^1]

The CNT's organizational structure proved vital to the revolution's
success. Built on principles of direct democracy,
<a href="federalism" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>,
and
<a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>, the union enabled workers to develop the skills and
confidence needed for self-management. Local assemblies made decisions
on immediate matters, while maintaining coordination through a federal
structure that balanced autonomy with collective action.[^2]

## Outbreak of Revolution

When fascist generals launched their military rebellion on July 17-18,
1936, the Spanish working class responded with immediate resistance. In
Barcelona, workers and militia forces defeated the military uprising by
July 19. This marked what anarchist leader Juan García Oliver called the
first time in history that the people defeated an army.[^3]

The <a href="Federación_Anarquista_Ibérica" class="wikilink"
title="Federación Anarquista Ibérica">Federación Anarquista Ibérica</a>
(FAI) press service reported from Barcelona on July 24, 1936:

> At the price of bloody battles and sorrowful losses, the Catalan
> capital has reconquered its title of Red Barcelona. It was a
> spontaneous popular uprising which answered the first onslaught of the
> Fascists. The city, deserted in the early morning hours, suddenly
> awoke as if by magic drum call; the people seemed to rise from the
> pavements. The armories were seized and in a flash almost everybody
> was armed.[^4]

Within days, workers had seized control of 3,000 enterprises in
Catalonia alone. The working class was, as
<a href="George_Orwell" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">George
Orwell</a> observed when he arrived in December 1936, "in the
saddle."[^5]

## Economic Reorganization

### Industrial Collectivization

Workers immediately took over factories, workshops, and public services.
The CNT and socialist
<a href="Unión_General_de_Trabajadores" class="wikilink"
title="Unión General de Trabajadores">Unión General de Trabajadores</a>
(UGT) unions organized production in railways, streetcars, buses,
shipping, power companies, engineering plants, mines, mills, textile
factories, and thousands of other enterprises.[^6]

Collectivized workplaces operated through workers' assemblies making key
decisions, with elected management committees carrying out day-to-day
operations. These committees remained accountable to the assembly and
could be recalled. Technical experts worked alongside workers rather
than commanding them. Industry-wide coordinating committees helped
rationalize production, closing inefficient small workshops and
consolidating operations into better-equipped facilities.[^7]

In Barcelona, 905 small barbershops were consolidated into 212 larger
shops. The metal industry was rebuilt for war production, with the
Hispano-Suiza automobile company converted within days to manufacture
armoured cars, ambulances, and munitions. An optical industry was
created virtually from nothing, producing telescopes, binoculars, and
scientific instruments for the war effort.[^8]

The Barcelona tramways became a model of workers' management. Within
five days of the fighting, 700 trams appeared on the roads, painted in
CNT-FAI red and black. The system introduced new safety measures,
straightened lines, reduced fares, and established free medical care for
workers and their families.[^9]

### Agricultural Collectivization

Between half and two-thirds of cultivated land in Republican Spain was
collectivized.[^10] Rural collectives operated on the principle "from
each according to ability, to each according to need." Many eliminated
money entirely, using vouchers or simply providing goods freely from
communal stores.

Collectivized agriculture achieved remarkable results.
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> reported that industrial productivity doubled in many areas,
with agricultural yields increasing 30-50%.[^11] Collectives diversified
crops, extended irrigation, initiated reforestation, established tree
nurseries, developed selective breeding programs, and built rural
technical schools.[^12]

The anarchist approach contrasted sharply with traditional agriculture.
As one collective member explained: "In their natural wisdom, our
Albalate de Cinca comrades reasoned that it was their duty to
demonstrate the superior quality of work in common. Once we can prove to
our brothers that collective labor saves time and energy, and brings
greater results to each member of the collective, the peasants now
standing aloof will join us."[^13]

## Public Services

### Healthcare

The Health Workers' Union was founded in September 1936 with 8,000
members, including doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives, pharmacists, and
veterinarians. Catalonia was divided into healthcare zones ensuring no
village lacked medical care. Six new hospitals opened in Barcelona
within a year, along with nine sanitariums for treating tuberculosis and
other diseases in converted luxury properties.[^14]

The socialization of medicine addressed the inequitable distribution of
doctors, who had previously concentrated in wealthy areas. Under the new
system, medical professionals were sent where needed most, providing
quality care regardless of ability to pay.

### Education

Libertarian education became a priority. The
<a href="Ferrer_Modern_Schools" class="wikilink"
title="Ferrer Modern Schools">Ferrer Modern Schools</a> expanded, and
adult literacy programs served workers after their shifts. Children
organized their own curriculum in collective schools, rejecting
militarism and religion while embracing art, culture, history and
science. Sex education became available despite opposition from Catholic
and Communist authorities.[^15]

### Transportation

Public transportation became free across much of revolutionary Spain.
This enabled workers and children to visit factories, farms, museums,
and cultural events, breaking down barriers between work, education, and
leisure.

## Women's Participation

The revolution brought significant changes in women's lives.
<a href="Mujeres_Libres" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a>, the anarchist women's organization with 30,000 members,
established schools, organized training programs for factory work, and
worked to end prostitution. Women entered traditionally male
occupations, including serving as tram drivers, factory workers, and
militia members.[^16]

However, full equality was not achieved. Wage differentials between men
and women persisted, women remained underrepresented in factory
committees, and domestic responsibilities still fell primarily on women.
The revolution's focus on workplace organization sometimes excluded
those not in industrial collectives from decision-making.[^17]

## Military Organization

The <a href="Confederal_militias" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist militias">anarchist militias</a> operated without
traditional military hierarchy. The
<a href="Durruti_Column" class="wikilink" title="Durruti Column">Durruti
Column</a>, led by <a href="Buenaventura_Durruti" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a>, grew from 3,000
to 8,000 fighters. Units elected their officers, abolished saluting and
titles, and maintained equal pay and conditions for all.[^18]

Durruti's death on November 20, 1936 dealt a severe blow to the
anarchist movement. Over 250,000 people attended his funeral in
Barcelona. His loss symbolized the challenges facing the revolution as
it confronted both fascist military forces and political opposition from
supposed allies.[^19]

The <a href="Iron_Column" class="wikilink" title="Iron Column">Iron
Column</a>, comprising former prisoners and marginalized workers,
fiercely resisted militarization, defending the militia system through
their newspaper Linea de Fuego. Despite being denounced as
"uncontrollables," they achieved military successes before forced
incorporation into the regular army in March 1937.[^20]

## International Support

Members of the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> fought in Spain alongside CNT forces and in the International
Brigades. The IWW's Industrial Worker newspaper reprinted CNT dispatches
and exposed illegal oil shipments to Franco by Texaco. Italian-American
anarchist
<a href="Carlo_Tresca" class="wikilink" title="Carlo Tresca">Carlo
Tresca</a> raised funds and gave speeches supporting the Spanish
revolution.[^21]

The anarchist press internationally, including Spanish Revolution in New
York and Spain and the World in Britain, provided coverage often absent
from mainstream and communist sources. These publications documented
both revolutionary achievements and the growing counter-revolutionary
threat.[^22]

## Environmental Protection

Agricultural cooperatives employed methods similar to
<a href="permaculture" class="wikilink"
title="permaculture">permaculture</a>, using multiple plants to increase
yields and improve soil health, such as planting shade-tolerant crops
under orange trees.[^23]

Metal factories linked to tuberculosis cases were shut down after
doctors identified connections between industrial pollution and
disease.[^24]

<a href="Daniel_Guérin" class="wikilink" title="Daniel Guérin">Daniel
Guérin</a> described the environmental benefits:

> After the Revolution the land was brought together into rational
> units, cultivated on a large scale and according to the general plan
> and directives of agronomists. The studies of agricultural technicians
> brought about yields 30 to 50 percent higher than before. The
> cultivated areas increased, human, animal, and mechanical energy was
> used in a more rational way, and working methods perfected. Crops were
> diversified, irrigation extended, reforestation initiated, and tree
> nurseries started.[^25]

## Counter-Revolution

The revolution faced opposition from multiple directions. The Republican
government, influenced heavily by the
<a href="Communist_Party_of_Spain" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party of Spain">Communist Party of Spain</a> and Soviet
advisers, worked systematically to undermine workers' control and
restore state authority.

### Political Conflicts

The <a href="Partit_Obrer_d&#39;Unificació_Marxista" class="wikilink"
title="Partit Obrer d&#39;Unificació Marxista">Partit Obrer d'Unificació
Marxista</a> (POUM), a revolutionary Marxist party allied with
anarchists, became a target of Communist repression. In June 1937, POUM
leader
<a href="Andrés_Nin" class="wikilink" title="Andrés Nin">Andrés Nin</a>
was arrested, tortured, and murdered by Soviet NKVD agents. George
Orwell, who served in POUM militia, barely escaped arrest and had to
flee Spain.[^26]

The Communist press conducted propaganda campaigns labeling anarchists
and POUM members as "fascists" and "Trotskyites."
<a href="Pravda" class="wikilink" title="Pravda">Pravda</a> announced in
December 1936 that "the mopping up of Trotskyists and
anarcho-syndicalists has already begun. It will be carried out with the
same vigor as in the USSR."[^27]

### May Days 1937

In May 1937, Communist-led Assault Guards attempted to seize the
CNT-controlled telephone exchange in Barcelona. Workers erected
barricades and five days of street fighting resulted in over 500 deaths.
The government sent 6,000 troops to disarm anarchist workers while
allowing Communist forces to keep their weapons.[^28]

The Friends of Durruti group called for continued resistance, but CNT
leadership appealed for a ceasefire. This marked a turning point, with
state power increasingly consolidated at the expense of revolutionary
gains.[^29]

### Economic Sabotage

The state used its control of credit and gold reserves to undermine
collectives. The October 1936 Collectivization Decree attempted to limit
socialization and create bureaucratic controls. Raw materials were
systematically denied to collectives until they accepted state
supervision. War industries operated by workers were strangled for
resources while state-controlled factories received supplies.[^30]

In August 1937, Communist general Enrique Lister's 11th Division
dissolved the anarchist
<a href="Regional_Defense_Council_of_Aragon" class="wikilink"
title="Regional Defense Council of Aragon">Regional Defense Council of
Aragon</a> by force, breaking up agricultural collectives and restoring
land to former owners. This disruption paralyzed agricultural production
and demoralized the peasantry.[^31]

### Militarization

The transformation of autonomous militias into a conventional army under
state control removed much of what workers were fighting for. The
abolition of militia democracy, imposition of traditional military
hierarchy, and political persecution of anarchist soldiers severely
damaged morale. As Soviet representative Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko
predicted: "Without the participation of the CNT, it will not be
possible to create the appropriate enthusiasm and discipline in the
people's militia."[^32]

## Collapse

By 1938, counter-revolutionary forces had largely dismantled workers'
control. The Republican government, now dominated by Communists and
their allies, prioritized defeating the revolution over defeating
fascism. Resources that could have gone to the front were diverted to
suppressing collectives. Anarchist militants capable of fighting Franco
were imprisoned or killed by their supposed allies.[^33]

Barcelona fell to fascist forces on January 26, 1939. Between 400,000
and 500,000 refugees, including the defeated Army of Catalonia, fled to
France. Franco's victory brought brutal repression, with over 10,000
executions in Catalonia alone in the first week of occupation.[^34]

## Debates and Analysis

### Extent of Revolution

Historians debate how far the revolution progressed. While agricultural
collectives often achieved genuine libertarian communism, industrial
collectives generally remained within a modified market framework. Some
anarchists argued this "workers' neocapitalism" fell short of full
socialization due to the failure to abolish the state and unify the
economy under workers' control.[^35]

Others emphasize the revolutionary achievements given wartime
constraints. The collectives demonstrated workers' capacity for
self-management, increased productivity, improved conditions, and
created innovations impossible under capitalism.[^36]

### Coercion Controversy

The voluntary nature of collectivization remains contested. Some
collectives formed through genuine enthusiasm and mutual aid. Others
involved pressure, particularly in the early chaotic period. Historian
Michael Seidman notes instances of economic pressure and social
exclusion used against holdouts, while also acknowledging many joined
willingly out of commitment to revolutionary ideals.[^37]

Most scholars conclude that while coercion existed in some cases, the
general pattern showed voluntary organization. The mixture of
collectivists and individualists in most villages demonstrates the
absence of systematic force. Historian Antony Beevor argues the
Communist claim that collectives were imposed at gunpoint contradicts
this evidence of peaceful coexistence.[^38]

### CNT Collaboration

The decision by CNT leadership to enter the Catalan Generalitat
government in September 1936 and the national government in November
1936 generated intense controversy.
<a href="Federica_Montseny" class="wikilink"
title="Federica Montseny">Federica Montseny</a>,
<a href="Juan_García_Oliver" class="wikilink"
title="Juan García Oliver">Juan García Oliver</a>, and other anarchist
ministers argued this prevented Communist monopolization of power and
ensured weapons reached the front.

Critics, including many anarchists, viewed this as a fundamental
betrayal of anti-state principles that legitimized the institutions used
to crush the revolution. The tension between "collaborationists" and
anti-authoritarians within the movement weakened anarchist resistance to
counter-revolution.[^39]

## Legacy

Survivors of the revolution emphasized their fortune in experiencing a
society based on freedom and solidarity. The period demonstrated the
possibility of large-scale anarchist organization and inspired
subsequent generations of anarchists worldwide.[^40]

The revolution's lessons remain debated. Some emphasize the achievements
in workers' self-management and agricultural collectivization. Others
focus on strategic and tactical errors, particularly the failure to
abolish the state when possible. All agree the revolution faced enormous
challenges: military invasion, economic isolation, hostile "allies," and
the need to simultaneously wage war and transform society.[^41]

As Buenaventura Durruti told journalist Pierre Van Paassen: "We are
giving Hitler and Mussolini far more worry with our revolution than the
whole Red Army of Russia. We are setting an example to the German and
Italian working class on how to deal with Fascism."[^42]
