Dolphins are a category of about forty species of aquatic mammals. They
are highly social creatures known for their mutual aid and empathy not
only within their species but with other some other species as well. For
example, a group of dolphins in 2004 circled humans off New Zealand’s
coast in order to protect the swimmers from a great white shark. A
biologist remarked on this incident, “Dolphins are known for helping
helpless things. It is an altruistic response and bottlenose dolphins in
particular are known for it.”[^1] In 2012 or 2013, an adult bottlenose
dolphin joined a group of sperm whales off the coast of Portugal: "For
eight days, the dolphin traveled, foraged and played with the adult
whales and their calves. When it rubbed its body against the whales,
they would sometimes even return the gesture."[^2] Traveling in groups
of hundreds, Sarawak dolphins welcome other species of dolphins and
whales to join them and "swim and eat in community".[^3]

Known to be extremely intelligent, dolphins communicate with each other
with clicks, whistles, and other sounds.[^4] The average dolphin lives
for twenty-five years, and a dolphin can live for up to forty years.[^5]

Dolphins live in a structure called a pod, sometimes known as a herd,
that usually has about twelve members. From time to time, pods
temporarily join together and form a school (superpod) that can
occasionally exceed 1,000 members. While there is some degree of
hierarchy within a pod, it is easy for a dolphin or family of dolphins
to leave a selfish leader behind and join a different herd. The website
*Dolphins World* explains, “It seems that dolphins are free spirits.
Studying the dynamic of the social composition of the pods, scientists
discovered that when dolphins belong to a group, nothing binds them to
it in a matter of space and time, this means that they can move freely
to different pods that are in their vicinity, then the movement of
members is continuous. This type of social network is flat and
open.”[^6]

The bottlenose dolphin has three basic levels of organization: the
group, the pod, and the school. A group has two to five individuals,
often a family. Groups join together to form a pod, which has up to
fifteen members. Finally, pods sometimes join together into a temporary
school, which has as many as thirty members.[^7]

Dolphin pods can switch between a variety of complex swimming formations
while hunting. Scouts will explore an area and let the rest of the herd
know if there are fish to eat. On the hunt, a herd rapidly switches
between different formations. Searching for food, the whole herd will
sometimes stick together, and other times they will split up and search
as small groups. Once it is time to catch and eat fish, the dolphins
swim in a circle around their prey, forcing the fish into a concentrated
mass on which the dolphins have an easy time feasting.[^8]

So-called “dominant” dolphins — who are sometimes females — have the job
of investigating any unknown situation and determining whether or not
the environment is safe for the herd.[^9]

Dolphins playfully jump above the water, dance, and chase each other.
They also toss around jellyfish and splash each other. Finally, dolphins
rub their bodies together and engage playfully during sexual
behavior.[^10] Dolphins interact sexually for fun, not just for
procreation. Homosexual contact is common.[^11]

Dolphin mothers sing to their babies when they're in the womb and for a
few weeks after their birth. The rest of the pod even stops their usual
sounds so that the babies can hear the singing.[^12]

Bottlenose dolphins give each other names, and they call loved one's
names when they become separated.[^13]
