<a href="Colin_Ward" class="wikilink" title="Colin Ward">Colin Ward</a>
describes it as:

> In a broadcast on the anniversary of the Soviet Invasion of
> Czechoslovakia a speaker looked back to the summer of 1968 in Prague
> as one in which, as she put it, "Everyone had become more gentle, more
> considerate. Crime and violence diminished. We all seemed to be making
> a special effort to make life tolerable, just because it had been so
> intolerable before".

> Now that the Prague Spring and the Czechoslovak long hot summer have
> retreated into history, we tend to forget - though the Czechs will not
> forget - the change in the *quality* of ordinary life, while the
> historians, busy with the politicians floating on the surface of
> events, or this or that memorandum from a Central Committee or a
> Praesidium, tell us nothing about what it felt like for people in the
> streets. At the time John Berger wrote of the immense impression made
> on him by the transformation of values: "Workers in many places
> spontaneously offered to work for nothing on Saturdays in order to
> contribute to the national fund. Those for whom, a few months before,
> the highest ideal was a consumer society, offered money and gold to
> help save the national economy. (Economically a naive gesture but
> ideologically a significant one.) I saw crowds of workers in the
> streets of Prague, their faces lit by an evident sense of opportunity
> and achievement. Such an atmosphere was bound to be temporary. But it
> was an unforgettable indication of the previously unused potential of
> a people: of the speed with which demoralisation may be overcome." And
> Harry Schwartz of the New York Times reminds us that "Gay,
> spontaneous, informal and relaxed were the words foreign
> correspondents used to described the vast outpouring of merry Prague
> citizens." What was Dubcek doing at the time? "He was trying to set
> limits on the spontaneous revolution that had been set in motion and
> tried to curb it. No doubt he had hoped to honour the promises he had
> given at Dresden that he would impose order on what more and more
> conservative Communists were calling
> '<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchy">anarchy</a>'".
> When the Soviet tanks rolled in to impose *their* order, the
> spontaneous order gave way to a spontaneous resistance. Of Prague,
> Kamil Winter declared, "I must confess to you that nothing was
> organised at all. Everything went on spontaneously ..." And of the
> second day of the invasion of Bratislava, Ladislav Mnacko wrote:
> "Nobody has given any order. Nobody was giving any orders at all.
> People knew of their own accord what needed to be done. Each and every
> one of them was their own government, with its orders and regulations,
> while the government itself was somewhere very far away, probably in
> Moscow. Everything the occupation forces tried to paralyse went on
> working and even worked better than in normal times; by the evening
> the people had even managed to deal with the bread situation."

> In November, when the students staged a sit-in at the universities,
> "the sympathy of the population with the students was shown by the
> dozens of trucks sent in from the factories to bring about food free
> of charge," and "Prague's railway workers threatened to strike if the
> government took reprisal measures against the students. Workers of
> various state organisations supplied them with food. The buses of the
> urban transport workers were placed at the strikers disposal ...
> Postal workers established certain free telephone communications
> between university towns."[^1]
