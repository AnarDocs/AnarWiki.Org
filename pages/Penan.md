The Penan are an egalitarian and historically hunter-gatherer society on
the island of Borneo (mainly the Malaysian part). Though most live in
villages today, some continue living nomadically. Their present
population is 10,000 to 12,000. Alongside
<a href="Dayak.md" class="wikilink" title="Dayak">Dayak</a> and other
native communities, the Penan have fought to defend Borneo’s rainforests
from the logging, palm oil, and hydroelectric industries.[^1]

Penan society is “egalitarian and nonhierarchical.” The Penan customary
law, ‘’Adat’’, says the rainforest was given to them by the Creator,
whom they call ‘’Balei Nge Butun’’ and that this land must be preserved
for the sake of all past, present and future generations. The greatest
transgression for the Penan is ‘’see hun’’, meaning a failure to share.
An important Penan values is ‘’molong’’, meaning to share wisely or to
take only what’s necessary.[^2]

‘’Adat’’ says, moreover, that “plants and animals and the ecosystem as a
whole have rights and therefore are not to be wantonly destroyed for the
short-term gain of a few individuals, or even an entire generation.” And
the “forest belongs to all members of the tribe under a system of usu-
fruct — everyone can take what he or she needs, so there is no need to
take more.” Moreover, [^3]

The Penan gather ferns, fruits, and a starch called ‘’sago’’ which comes
from small palm trees. They also fish and hunt pigs and deer. More
recently, the Penan have farmed rice and other crops.[^4]

Photographer Sofia Yu corroborates that the Penan “live in a
non-hierarchical society” and adds they “have a great sense of humor and
were always warm and had great intentions towards me. Women were free to
choose the men that they liked, often heckling the lazier ones, but
always in a light-hearted way. They have no sense of age and they don’t
seem to care what they look like.” Yu observes, “For the Penan who still
live in the forest, the land is most important thing in their lives and
an extension of themselves.”[^5]
