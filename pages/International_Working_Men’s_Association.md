The International Working Men's Association (IWMA), later known as the
"First International," was founded in 1864 and united workers'
organizations across many countries. With around 150,000 members by
1871,[^1] the IWMA had anarchist-leaning sections in Europe, the
Americas, and Africa.

Additionally, anarchists within the IWMA organized the International
Brotherhood and the International Alliance for Socialist Democracy. In
1872, the IWMA split into two competing federations: an
anti-authoritarian International and a Marxist International. Historian
Robert Graham writes that from the IWMA "would ultimately spring an
international anarchist movement."[^2]

# Bakunin's Organizations

When the Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin joined the IWMA in 1868, he formed
the Alliance of Socialist Democracy. This public group existed alongside
the clandestine International Brotherhood (IB) that Bakunin formulated
earlier, in 1866. Bakunin said the Alliance's role was “to give \[the\]
masses a really revolutionary direction.”[^3]

The extent of these groups' libertarianism is subject to debate. The
International Brotherhood operated as a representative democracy, not a
direct democracy. An elected and recallable “central committee” of three
to five members gave “supreme direction” to local sections, according to
the notes of the Brotherhood's Italian branch.[^4] Bakunin wrote in his
program for the Brotherhood that the revolutionary association “must
necessarily take the form of a secret society,” and members would be
“subject to strict discipline.”[^5]

In <a href="Demanding_the_Impossible:_A_History_of_Anarchism.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism">Demanding the
Impossible: A History of Anarchism</a>, Peter Marshall contends that
Bakunin's emphasis on secrecy and conspiracy sharply contradicted with
his aims of building a libertarian society.

*An Anarchist FAQ*, while agreeing that “Bakunin was inconsistent in
some ways,” highlights the fact that Bakunin's insistence on secrecy
must be placed in historical context; at the time “many states were
despotic monarchies, with little or no civil rights.”[^7] The *FAQ* also
emphasizes that contrary to accusations of Bakunin being secretly
authoritarian, he strictly and consistently opposed the taking of state
power.[^8]

In September 1870, Bakunin and members of the Alliance went to Lyon for
two weeks and organized an uprising. After the city council tried to cut
municipal workers' pay, thousands protested at City Hall. Bakunin and
associates seized City Hall, and control over the hall passed back and
forth between them and the National Guard.[^9] Protesters put up posters
declaring the abolition of the State:

> `   ARTICLE I: The administrative and governmental machinery of the state, having become impotent, is abolished.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 2: All criminal and civil courts are hereby suspended and replaced by the People's justice.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 3: Payment of taxes and mortgages is suspended. Taxes are to be replaced by contributions that the federated communes will have collected by levies upon the wealthy classes, according to what is needed for the salvation of France.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 4: Since the state has been abolished, it can no longer intervene to secure the payment of private debts.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 5: All existing municipal administrative bodies are hereby abolished. They will be replaced in each commune by commit­tees for the salvation of France. All governmental powers will be exer­cised by these committees under the direct supervision of the People.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 6: The committee in the principal town of each of the nation's departments will send two delegates to a revolutionary convention for the salvation of France.`
>
> `   ARTICLE 7: This convention will meet immediately at the town hall of Lyon, since it is the second city of France and the best able to deal energetically with the country's defence. Since it will be supported by the People this convention will save France. TO ARMS!!!`

The National Guard eventually regained a stable control of City Hall and
arrested Bakunin, but some sympathetic guardsmen helped free him. While
the uprising was short-lived, it inspired a wave of other uprisings "in
Toulouse, Narbonne, Cette, Perpignan, Limoges, Saint-Etienne, Le
Creusot, and other towns."[^10] The most significant in the wave of
uprisings was the 1871 formation of the
<a href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a>. According to Peter Marshall, the uprising "marked the
beginning of the revolutionary movement which was to culminate in the
Paris Commune the following spring."[^11]

# Split in the International

During his time in the International, Bakunin debated with Marx and his
followers over the question of state power. While Marx argued that
socialists should seize the state and use it to eliminate class
differences, Bakunin countered that this strategy would simply create a
new ruling class of bureaucrats.

In September 1871, Marx and Engels, as members of the IWMA's general
council, held a private London Conference, away from continental Europe
where anarchists were influential. Graham reports that by this time, the
majority of International members in Italy, Spain, Swiss Jura, France,
and Belgium had anti-authoritarian orientations.[^12] The London
Conference had twenty-two voting delegates, nine delegates from national
IWMA sections and thirteen delegates of whom were either IWMA general
council members or at-large members appointed by the general council.
Thus, the voting was heavily skewed to favor the views of the the
General Council members, who had never been elected at a general IWMA
congress.[^13] The delegates at this conference passed a resolution, at
odds with the beliefs of Anarchist members, that against the “collective
power of the propertied classes the working class cannot act, as a
class, except by constituting itself into a political party.”[^14]

At the 1872 Hague Congress, Marx, Engels, and their followers succeeded
in expelling Bakunin from the IWMA, to reaffirm the Marxist-leaning
positions of the London Congress, and to move the IWMA's General Council
to New York, where it would be more isolated from anarchist influence.
Some of Marx's own allies quit the IWMA in disgust.[^15]

In 1873, Bakunin published *Statism and Anarchy*, which critiqued Marx's
program:

> Thus, no matter the angle from which we examine the matter, we are led
> to the same execrable result: government of the vast majority of the
> masses of the people by a privileged minority. But this minority, the
> marxians argue, will be made up of workers. Yes, to be sure, of former
> workers who, as soon as they become the people's governors and
> representatives, will stop being workers and will begin to look down
> upon the proletarian world from the heights of the State: they will
> then represent, not the people, but themselves and their ambitions to
> govern it. Anyone who queries that does not know human nature.[^16]

# The Two Internationals

After the Hague Congress, the International split into two separate
organizations: Marx's IWMA and the anti-authoritarians' IWMA. Marx's
International became, according to Graham, a mere “shell
organization.”[^17]

The anti-authoritarians' International established itself at the 1972
Saint Imer Congress just a week after the Hague Congress. Attendees
created a federalist structure, with each section enjoying full
autonomy. They also officially endorsed the value of direct action.
Within this anti-authoritarian International, there were debates over
strategy. Some tendencies most emphasized trade unions and other
tendencies most emphasized communes.[^18] The anti-authoritarians'
International had sections in Belgium, France, Italy, Russia,
Switzerland, Greece, Egypt, Uruguay, Spain, the United States, Britain,
and the Netherlands.[^19]

In many ways, Marx's attacks on the Anarchists helped create the modern
Anarchist movement. Graham writes that after learning of his expulsion,
Bakunin, “began developing a more incisive critique of Marxism that went
beyond simply criticizing Marx and Engles's underhanded tactics and
dealt with the theoretical underpinnings and limitations of Marx's
theories.”[^20] The anti-authoritarian International played “a role in
the creation of an avowedly anarchist international revolutionary
movement.”[^21]

# Collapse

The anti-authoritarian International collapsed in 1877, the year after
the Marxist International. At the final Verviers Congress, sections
disagreed on the question of whether to compromise with Marxist
political parties. Belgian and Ducth sections left the
anti-authoritarian International to pursue Social Democratic projects.
The Russian anarcho-syndicalist Vadim Damier contends, “The desire for
compromise with the reformists killed the IWMA.”[^22]
