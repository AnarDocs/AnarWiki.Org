## Background

Following the
"<a   href="Great_Recession.md" class="wikilink" title="Great Recession">"Great
Recession</a> in 2007 and 2008, a major Swiss railway country was
rumoured that it would lay off more than 400 workers, but didn't say
who. The trade union demanded information on who would be fired. During
a meeting with the workers and the bosses, the boss confirmed it was
true and the workers threw the boss out of the meeting hall and went on
strike.

## Events

The strikers formed solidarity committees with all local towns and
factories, and soon protest marches with flags and balloons broke out. A
massive solidarity fund was created and the workers occupied their rail
workshops and sabotaged train tracks, also threatening to block major
rail routes. Several workshops were the only factories in the country
capable of producing breaks for cargo trains. Workers hung red flags
from their houses and occupied workplaces.

## Results

The strike was successful and no workers were laid off.
