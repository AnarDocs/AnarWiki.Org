This article outlines the **contradictions of capitalism**, or the ways
in which authoritarian capitalists contradict their own values. As such,
this article takes "<a   href="Private_Property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">"private property</a> rights, markets and
corporations for granted. Even if we as anarchists have our own
critiques of these ideas.

## General Capitalist Contradictions

### Property Rights

- Capitalists often assert their belief in private property rights, that
  it's morally unacceptable to violate these and steal from people or
  coerce them into things. Despite this, history is filled with examples
  of capitalists contradicting their own principles.
  - Capitalist countries like
    "<a   href="Australia.md" class="wikilink" title="Australia">"Australia</a>,
    "<a   href="Brazil.md" class="wikilink" title="Brazil">"Brazil</a>,
    "<a   href="Canada.md" class="wikilink" title="Canada">"Canada</a>,
    "<a   href="Finland.md" class="wikilink" title="Finland">"Finland</a>,
    "<a   href="Mexico.md" class="wikilink" title="Mexico">"Mexico</a>,
    "<a   href="New_Zealand.md" class="wikilink" title="New Zealand">"New
    Zealand</a>,
    "<a   href="Norway.md" class="wikilink" title="Norway">"Norway</a>,
    "<a   href="Sweden.md" class="wikilink" title="Sweden">"Sweden</a> and the
    "<a   href="United_States_of_America.md" class="wikilink"
    title="United States">"United States</a> regularly see corporations
    and the state working to violate the property rights of indigenous
    communities to make way for development and natural resource
    extraction. (Specific details are available on each countries page)
  - Wage theft is an epidemic in capitalist countries despite it being
    illegal in all of them.
    - A 2017 report by Middlesex University and Trust for London
      revealed that at least 2 million workers in Britain are losing an
      estimated £3 billion in unpaid holiday pay and wages per year. It
      suggested that withholding holiday pay, not paying wages and
      workers losing a couple of hours money per week are some of the
      deliberate strategies used by employers to improve their
      profits.[^1]
    - A 2012 study by the Iowa Policy Project calculated that dishonest
      employers defraud Iowa workers out of about \$600 million annually
      in wages.[^2]

### The Rule of Law

- Capitalists frequently proclaim their commitment to the rule of law
  and equality before the law, yet legal systems in capitalist countries
  systematically favor the wealthy and powerful.
  - White-collar crimes that cost society billions typically result in
    fines or civil penalties, while poor individuals face imprisonment
    for far less harmful offenses. During the 2008 financial crisis,
    banks paid approximately \$243 billion in fines for fraud and
    misconduct, yet virtually no executives faced criminal prosecution
    despite causing trillions in economic damage.[^3]
  - Corporations routinely violate environmental, labor, and safety
    laws, treating fines as a cost of doing business rather than
    deterrents. The legal system allows them to continue operating while
    individuals would face prison for equivalent harm.
  - Access to justice depends heavily on wealth. Those who can afford
    expensive legal representation receive vastly different outcomes
    than those relying on underfunded public defenders. In the United
    States, 80% of criminal defendants cannot afford a lawyer.[^4]

### Democratic Representation

- Capitalist countries claim to uphold democratic principles and
  government by the people, yet systematically structure political
  systems to serve corporate and wealthy interests.
  - Corporate lobbying distorts democratic representation. In the United
    States, corporations and industry groups spend approximately \$3.5
    billion annually on lobbying, vastly outspending public interest
    groups and ensuring legislation favors business interests.[^5]
  - Campaign finance systems allow the wealthy to exercise
    disproportionate influence. In the United States, the top 0.01% of
    donors (about 25,000 people) contributed more than 40% of all
    campaign contributions in recent elections.[^6]
  - The "revolving door" between corporations and government sees
    executives moving into regulatory positions overseeing their former
    industries, then returning to corporate positions afterward,
    creating conflicts of interest and regulatory capture.
  - Media ownership concentration means that a small number of wealthy
    individuals and corporations control the information citizens
    receive, shaping political discourse to serve elite interests.

### Crime and Punishment

- Capitalist societies claim justice systems exist to protect people and
  deter crime, yet punishment falls overwhelmingly on the poor while
  corporate and white-collar criminals face minimal consequences.
  - In the United States, someone is imprisoned for a drug offense every
    25 seconds, primarily affecting poor communities, while
    pharmaceutical executives whose companies fueled the opioid epidemic
    killing hundreds of thousands faced no criminal charges.[^7]
  - Prison systems in many capitalist countries operate as modern forms
    of slavery, with inmates forced to work for pennies per hour or no
    wages at all. The 13th Amendment to the US Constitution explicitly
    allows slavery "as punishment for crime."
  - For-profit prisons create financial incentives to imprison more
    people. Private prison corporations lobby for harsher sentencing
    laws and immigration enforcement to maintain high incarceration
    rates and profits.[^8]
  - Punishment severity correlates strongly with class and race rather
    than harm caused. Poor people receive longer sentences for theft of
    small amounts while corporate executives who steal millions through
    wage theft or fraud face civil penalties if anything.

### Affluence and Poverty

- Capitalist ideology claims that free markets create prosperity and
  efficiently allocate resources, yet capitalist societies produce
  obscene wealth alongside mass deprivation and waste.
  - Global inequality has reached extreme levels. The world's 26 richest
    people own as much wealth as the poorest 50% of humanity (3.8
    billion people).[^9]
  - Homelessness exists alongside massive housing vacancy. In the United
    States, there are approximately 17 million vacant homes while
    580,000 people experience homelessness on any given night.[^10]
  - Food waste occurs on a massive scale while people go hungry.
    Approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted,
    enough to feed 2 billion people, while 690 million people suffer
    from hunger.[^11]
  - Within wealthy capitalist nations, poverty persists despite
    unprecedented productive capacity. In the United States, 38 million
    people live in poverty while the country has more billionaires than
    any other nation.

### Antipodean Examples

#### Australia

- The entire country is built on theft from over 250 indigenous nations
  that was violently destroyed by the British Empire with a systemic
  campaign of massacres and segregation. Even today, the special land
  rights given to indigenous people are frequently violated for the
  benefit of large corporations.
- A 2019 report put the annual figure for wage theft in Australia at
  more than \$1.35 billion and estimated as much as 13% of the total
  workforce has been affected – more than a million people.[^12]

#### New Zealand

From 1984 to 1993,
"<a   href="New_Zealand.md" class="wikilink" title="New Zealand">"New
Zealand</a> underwent radical free-market reforms, moving from a
regulated social democracy to an extreme free-market system. The reforms
included floating the currency, removing agricultural subsidies,
privatizing state assets, abolishing price controls, and reducing
tariffs.

The results over the next 15 years were catastrophic for the people of
New Zealand:

- Approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and
  1992 (New Zealand's population in 1992 was 3,532,000 people)
- Unemployment rose from 3.6% to 11% between 1986 and 1992
- Child poverty doubled from 14% in 1982 to 29% in 1994
- Youth suicide rates grew sharply into one of the highest in the
  developed world
- Between 1985 and 1992, New Zealand's economy grew by only 4.7% during
  the same period in which the average OECD nation grew by 28.2%
- Those on the lowest incomes did not recover their 1980s living
  standards for twenty years.[^13].
