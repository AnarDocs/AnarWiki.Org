## Analysis

### Positives

- The major positive action of socialist Afghanistan was the

  Forced marriages were banned, women and girls were encouraged to work
  and get an education and legal equality between the
  "<a   href="Sex_(Biology).md" class="wikilink" title="sexes">sexes</a> was
  introduced. Numerous women also held high positions in the Afghani
  government.

### Negatives

- The government ultimately failed to withstand an imperialist onslaught
  and internal uprisings led by reactionary and conservative forces, as
  well as some on the left.
- In 1979, the government carried out a disastrous effort at land
  reform, it was extremely unpopular and agricultural productivity
  plummeted.
- The plans for industrial development in the late 1980s were extremely
  unsuccessful, promising 25% economic growth a year, but only reaching
  2%. Although how much of this can be attributed to poor government
  planning policies vs the civil war is up for debate.
- Despite widespread literacy campaigns, the government failed to reduce
  illiteracy by much, in contrast to most other socialist societies.
- The government created a new climate of repression that even alarmed
  the "<a   href="USSR.md" class="wikilink" title="USSR">USSR</a>.
- The government suffered a massive amount of infighting and debate
  between moderates and radicals.

### Lessons for the Future

- The authoritarian socialists are wrong, top-down governments and
  militaries are not sufficient to defend a socialist society from
  counter-revolutionaries and imperialist aggression. Even with the help
  of the USSR, the government failed to stop the counter-revolution,
