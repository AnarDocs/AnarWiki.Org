In the Watts section of Los Angeles on 11 August 1965, the police
arrested a black driver, clubbed a bystander, and seized a young black
woman.[^1] Over the next week, riots of predominantly black residents
lasted caused \$300 in property damage in the 47 square-mile zone around
the neighborhood. 35,000 people actively rioted and twice that number
were "close spectators." It took 16,000 police and National Guardsmen to
quell the uprising.[^2]

The uprising's spontaneity led the police chief William Parker to
correctly observe, "These rioters don't have any leaders." Black
establishment leadership dismissed the riot, and the NAACP's general
secretary Roy Wilkins even said the rioters "should be put down with all
necessary force."[^3] Locally, however, churches and other grassroots
organizations provided food and childcare that allowed the uprising to
continue.[^4]

The journalist Robert Conot remarked, "In Los Angeles, the Negro was
going on record that he would no longer turn the other cheek. That,
frustrated and goaded, he would strike back, whether the response of
violence was an appropriate one or no." The police and National Guard
response was brutal, with four thousand arrested and thirty-four
killed.[^5]

The "<a   href="Situationist_International.md" class="wikilink"

supported the uprising and remarked, "What American blacks are really
daring to demand is the right to really live, and in the final analysis
this requires nothing less than the total subversion of this
society."[^6] The Situationists saw the riot in primarily class terms:
"The Watts riot was not a *racial* conflict: the rioters left alone the
whites who were in their path, attacking only the white policemen, while
on the other hand black solidarity did not extend to black
store-owners."[^7]

On 18 August, the police attacked a Nation of Islam temple, signaling "a
bloody end to the rebellion."[^8]
