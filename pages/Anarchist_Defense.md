# Anarchist Large Scale Defense

## Overview

Anarchism has long contemplated and faced the reality of the theory and
practice of protecting anarchist societies and revolutionary movements
from external military aggression and internal counter-revolution
through non-hierarchical, voluntary, and self-managed means. Unlike
statist approaches that rely on professional standing armies and
centralized command structures, anarchist defense is based on armed
populations organized through federations of militias, defense
committees, and workers' councils.

This article focuses on large-scale revolutionary defense - protecting
entire territories, societies, and revolutionary transformations from
organized military forces and counter-revolutionary campaigns. For local
community protection against police violence, fascist attacks, and
everyday threats, see <a href="Community_Defense" class="wikilink"
title="Community Defense">Community Defense</a>.

The fundamental principle is that defense must be consistent with
anarchist values of freedom, voluntary association, and self-management.
As Alexander Berkman argued, anarchism is "opposed to any interference
with your liberty" but recognizes that "when any one attacks you, then
it is he who is invading you, he who is employing violence against you.
You have a right to defend yourself."[^1] This self-defense "excludes
all acts of coercion, of persecution or revenge. It is concerned only
with repelling attack and depriving the enemy of opportunity to invade
you."[^2]

The strength of anarchist defense lies not in military technology or
hierarchical organization, but in popular support and the active
participation of the people themselves. When workers and peasants feel
they are making the revolution themselves and have become masters of
their lives, they will defend it with passionate commitment.[^3]

## Origins

The theory of anarchist defense developed alongside anarchist
revolutionary theory in the late 19th century. Mikhail Bakunin argued
that during a revolution, communities would naturally organize armed
defense through federations: "Paris will naturally make haste to
organise itself as best it can, in revolutionary style, after the
workers have joined into associations...armed and organised by streets
and quartiers, they will form the revolutionary federation of all the
quartiers, the federative commune."[^4]

Errico Malatesta advocated for the "creation of a voluntary militia,
without powers to interfere as militia in the life of the community, but
only to deal with any armed attacks by the forces of reaction to
re-establish themselves, or to resist outside intervention by countries
as yet not in a state of revolution."[^5] He emphasized that the most
powerful means of defense "remains always that of taking away from the
bourgeois the economic means on which their power rests, and of arming
everybody...and of interesting the mass of the population in the victory
of the revolution."[^6]

The practical development of anarchist defense structures occurred
during the major revolutions of the early 20th century, particularly in
Russia, Ukraine, and Spain, where anarchists created various forms of
defense committees, militias, and armed organizations based on these
principles.

## Key Principles

Anarchist defense at the revolutionary scale operates according to
specific principles that distinguish it from both state militaries and
smaller-scale <a href="Community_Self-Defense" class="wikilink"
title="community protection">community protection</a>:

### Armed Population

Rather than relying on a specialized military caste, anarchist defense
is based on arming the entire population. The CNT's 1936 resolution
stated: "The people armed will be the best assurance against any attempt
to restore the system destroyed from either within or without...Let each
Commune have its weapons and means of defence."[^7]

Malatesta argued that "a people who really want to defend their own
country are invincible" and that "before the corps of volunteers
(anarchist formations) thrones topple, and regular armies composed of
conscripts or mercenaries disappear."[^8]

This distinguishes revolutionary defense from both professional armies
and the more localized forms of community protection. While
<a href="Community_Self-Defense" class="wikilink"
title="community self-defense">community self-defense</a> may involve
specific trained individuals responding to immediate threats,
revolutionary defense requires the general armament and military
preparedness of the entire population.

### Liberatory Practice

Defense must advance rather than contradict revolutionary goals.
Anarchist militias do not impose their will on liberated areas but
instead encourage populations to organize themselves freely. When
Makhnovist forces passed through Ukrainian districts, they announced:
"The freedom of the workers and the peasants is their own, and not
subject to any restriction. It is up to the workers and peasants to act,
to organise themselves, to agree among themselves in all aspects of
their lives, as they themselves see fit and desire."[^9]

This principle extends to the treatment of captured enemies and defeated
counter-revolutionaries, emphasizing humane treatment, re-education, and
integration into revolutionary society rather than execution or
imprisonment.

### Federation and Strategic Coordination

Large-scale military operations require coordination beyond what is
needed for local community protection. Anarchist defense achieves this
through federalist structures where local units maintain autonomy while
voluntarily coordinating strategy and resources. As the Spanish militias
demonstrated, "every column retains its freedom of action" even while
achieving "co-ordination of forces, which is not the same thing as unity
of command."[^10]

This federalist approach allows for both tactical flexibility and
strategic unity without creating permanent hierarchies or centralized
command structures that could threaten revolutionary gains.

## Organizational Structures

### Defense Committees

Defense committees emerged as the primary organizational structure for
anarchist military preparation, particularly in Spain during the 1930s.
These committees existed at multiple levels - local, district, regional,
and national - coordinating through federation rather than hierarchy.

The basic unit was the defense group or cadre, typically consisting of
six militants, each responsible for specific tasks including
intelligence gathering, identifying strategic points, studying public
services, locating resources, and coordinating with other groups. A
National Committee of Defense Committees presentation in October 1934
outlined this structure in detail, emphasizing that defense groups were
"the clandestine military organizations of the CNT, financed by the
trade unions."[^11]

Defense committees had two essential functions: acquisition,
maintenance, and training in weapons use; and logistical
responsibilities including supplies, hospitals, schools, and
recruitment. "The authority of the Defense Committees was based on their
character as armed organizations. Their power was the power of the
workers in arms."[^12]

### Militias

Anarchist militias formed the fighting force of revolutionary defense,
organized on voluntary and democratic principles. Unlike professional
armies, militia members lived and worked among the general population
during peacetime, ensuring they shared the outlook and interests of
those they defended.

Militia organization typically followed this structure:

- **Fireteams** of 3-4 fighters with elected team leaders
- **Squads** of 30-40 fighters (multiple fireteams) with coordination
  committees
- **Columns** of several hundred to thousands organized through
  federation of squads

Officers were elected, subject to recall, received the same pay as
troops, and lived under the same conditions. Military operations were
coordinated through delegates from each unit rather than imposed by a
command hierarchy. When fighting fascism after July 1936, the Spanish
CNT organized militias where "thirty centurias make up one column, which
is directed by a war committee, on which the delegates from the
centurias have their say."[^13]

The militia structure differs from
<a href="Community_Self-Defense" class="wikilink"
title="community self-defense">community self-defense</a> models in its
scale and permanence during revolutionary periods. While community
defense may involve temporary mobilization for specific threats,
revolutionary militias represent sustained military campaigns against
organized enemy forces.

### Revolutionary Committees

In the Spanish Revolution, Revolutionary Committees emerged in
neighborhoods and municipalities to coordinate both defense and social
transformation. These committees, primarily composed of CNT members but
sometimes including other anti-fascist organizations, exercised diverse
functions including:

- Confiscation and operation of buildings, hospitals, and resources
- Organization of armed searches and arrests of counter-revolutionaries
- Recruitment, arming, and supply of militia forces
- Establishment of popular kitchens and supply networks
- Imposition and collection of revolutionary taxes
- Issuance of travel permits and administrative documents

These committees lasted from July 1936 until their forced dissolution in
June 1937, with some resisting until September 1937.[^14]

### International Solidarity Networks

Anarchist defense extends beyond local organization to international
solidarity. The Anarchist Black Cross, founded in Russia in 1905,
created international chapters supporting political prisoners and
facilitating escapes. Such networks helped keep revolutionary movements
alive under repression and built connections that strengthened future
resistance.

International solidarity serves both to pressure authoritarian regimes
and to spread revolutionary movements across borders. As Bakunin noted,
"a social revolution cannot be a revolution in one nation alone. It is
by nature an international revolution."[^15]

## Historical Examples

### Makhnovist Movement (1918-1921)

The Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, known as the Makhnovists
after their most prominent organizer Nestor Makhno, demonstrated
anarchist defense principles on a large scale during the Russian Civil
War. Operating in southern Ukraine from 1918 to 1921, the Makhnovists
defended peasant and worker autonomy against multiple authoritarian
forces including German and Austrian occupation, Ukrainian nationalists,
the White Army, and eventually the Bolshevik Red Army.

The Makhnovist army operated according to principles of voluntary
enlistment, election of officers, and self-discipline according to rules
adopted by each unit. Officers who proved incompetent could be
immediately recalled and replaced. Despite being vastly outnumbered and
equipped almost entirely with weapons seized from enemies, the
Makhnovists achieved remarkable military success through mobility,
guerrilla tactics, and popular support.

The Makhnovists organized regional congresses of peasants and workers to
discuss revolutionary issues and encouraged communities to "set up free
peasants' and workers' councils" and to expropriate land and means of
production. They declared: "Freedom of speech, of the press and of
assembly is the right of every toiler and any gesture contrary to that
freedom constitutes an act of counter-revolution."[^16]

Their extraordinary mobility allowed them to "turn up quite suddenly
where least expected, attack the gentry and military garrisons, then
vanish as quickly as they had come."[^17] When cornered, "the Makhnovtsy
would bury their weapons, make their way singly back to their villages,
and take up work in the fields, awaiting the next signal to unearth a
new cache of arms and spring up again in an unexpected quarter."[^18]

The Makhnovists played crucial roles in defeating both General Denikin's
White Army at the Battle of Peregonovka and General Wrangel's forces at
the Perekop isthmus. However, after these victories, the Bolsheviks
betrayed their anarchist allies and used overwhelming force to crush the
movement by 1921.

### Spanish Revolution (1936-1939)

The Spanish Revolution produced the most extensive and well-documented
examples of anarchist defense in practice. When fascist military forces
attempted a coup on July 19, 1936, anarchist workers and militia
defeated them in Barcelona and other cities. The CNT and FAI immediately
organized militias to liberate fascist-held territories.

These militias maintained anarchist principles of organization while
engaging in sustained military campaigns. Fighters elected their
commanders, who received the same pay and lived under identical
conditions as troops. The famous Durruti Column exemplified this
approach, with Buenaventura Durruti arguing: "Our comrades on the front
know for whom and for what they fight. They feel themselves
revolutionaries and they fight, not in defence of more or less promised
new laws, but for the conquest of the world, of the factories, the
workshops, the means of transportation, their bread and the new
culture."[^19]

When anarchist militias liberated towns and villages, they did not
impose their authority but instead called mass assemblies and urged
workers and peasants to organize themselves freely, collectivize land
and industry, and establish their own forms of self-governance. Across
Catalonia and Aragon, hundreds of collectives formed in this way.

The CNT organized defense through neighborhood and district committees
that coordinated recruitment, supply, and strategic planning while
maintaining bottom-up control. Each neighborhood maintained close
relationships with "their" militiamen at the front, welcoming them on
leave and ensuring supplies reached them.

Unfortunately, the anarchist militias faced betrayal from their supposed
Republican and Communist allies. Anarchist troops were systematically
denied arms and ammunition, left to face fascist forces with inadequate
equipment. The Republican government preferred to disarm revolutionary
forces rather than risk social transformation, ultimately weakening the
anti-fascist war effort. As one analysis concluded, "the 'people in
arms' won the revolution and the 'People's Army' which replaced it lost
the war."[^20]

### Russian Revolution Black Guards

Following the February Revolution of 1917, anarchists in Russian cities
formed "Black Guards" to defend expropriated houses, maintain
revolutionary order, and protect against counter-revolution. These
decentralized armed groups operated independently of Bolshevik military
structures and defended anarchist spaces and communities.

The Black Guards exemplified anarchist defense principles through
voluntary organization, horizontal structure, and focus on protecting
revolutionary gains rather than seizing state power. However, they faced
increasing repression from the Bolshevik government after October 1917,
culminating in violent suppression by 1918-1919.

## Methods and Tactics

### Defensive Strategy

Anarchist defense emphasizes defensive rather than offensive operations.
The goal is to repel invasion and protect freedom, not to conquer
territory or impose rule on others. This defensive orientation makes
anarchist forces formidable when protecting their communities, as "a
people who really want to defend their own country are invincible."[^21]

Defenders enjoy significant advantages: intimate knowledge of terrain,
popular support providing intelligence and supplies, moral clarity of
fighting for home and freedom, and the motivation that comes from
defending one's own revolution rather than serving imposed authority.

### Guerrilla Warfare

Anarchist forces have repeatedly demonstrated effectiveness in guerrilla
warfare due to their decentralized organization, local autonomy, and
popular support. Small units with decision-making authority can respond
rapidly to changing conditions, strike unexpectedly, and disperse before
enemies can concentrate forces.

The Makhnovists perfected this approach on the Ukrainian steppe, using
extraordinary mobility to appear where least expected, attack, and
vanish. Similarly, the Mapuche of South America successfully resisted
Spanish conquest for centuries through decentralized guerrilla warfare,
while centralized indigenous empires like the Aztec and Inca fell
quickly.

One academic analysis concluded that anarchist structures provide
crucial advantages for guerrilla warfare: "MAM's \[Mutual Aid Militias\]
flexible structure accounts for this. When smaller units have more
autonomy in the field, they are able to quickly change their plans and
adapt when things go wrong."[^22]

### Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence

Defense committees historically devoted significant resources to
gathering intelligence on enemy forces, identifying
counter-revolutionaries, and protecting revolutionary organizations from
infiltration. The defense group structure typically included members
specifically responsible for intelligence work.

At the revolutionary scale, intelligence operations must coordinate
across entire territories, requiring federated intelligence networks
that can track enemy troop movements, supply lines, and strategic
planning while protecting revolutionary security.

### Logistics and Supply

Large-scale revolutionary defense requires comprehensive logistical
systems. Anarchist defense relies on decentralized supply networks
rooted in worker and peasant communities. Rather than centralized supply
lines vulnerable to disruption, communities directly supply their
militia members through local organizations.

Historical examples show revolutionary committees organizing supply
networks, popular kitchens, arms storage, and resource distribution
through voluntary cooperation. The CNT in Spain financed and supplied
its militias through trade union contributions and neighborhood
organizations.

### Dealing with Counter-Revolution

Anarchist theory advocates humane treatment of counter-revolutionaries
captured during defense operations. Rather than execution, imprisonment,
or revenge, the approach emphasizes re-education, integration into
communities, and addressing the root causes of opposition.

Berkman argued that "the defeated counter-revolutionary 'prisoners in
freedom' would depend on the community and the good will of its members
for their means of existence. They would live in its atmosphere and be
influenced by its revolutionary environment."[^23] This approach aims to
transform enemies into participants in the new society rather than
creating a cycle of revenge and conspiracy.

The Makhnovists distinguished between defeated enemies who surrendered
and those captured during armed resistance. While defending against
attacks, they "did not slaughter the wounded nor those taken prisoners
execute" and rejected "the barbarous system of shooting hostages."[^24]

### Freedom of Criticism

A crucial principle of anarchist defense is maintaining freedom of
speech and criticism even for opponents of the revolution. Berkman
argued: "By all means. Let them talk all they like. To restrain them
would serve only to create a persecuted class and thereby enlist popular
sympathy for them and their cause."[^25]

The revolution must be "big enough to welcome even the severest
criticism, and profit by it if it is justified." Defense against "mere
talk" or expression of opinion contradicts anarchist principles and
weakens rather than strengthens revolutionary society. The revolution
defends itself "most determinedly against real counter-revolution,
against all active enemies, against any attempt to defeat or sabotage it
by forcible invasion or violence."[^26]

## Relationship to Authority and State

### Rejection of Revolutionary State

A fundamental principle of anarchist defense is rejection of the
"revolutionary state" or "workers' state" advocated by
Marxist-Leninists. Anarchists argue that creating a new state to defend
the revolution contradicts revolutionary goals and inevitably leads to
the creation of a new ruling class.

As analyzed in one contemporary account: "If it did this then the
revolution will have failed and a new class society would have been
created (a society based on state bureaucrats and oppressed workers as
in the Soviet Union)."[^27]

The Bolshevik example demonstrated this danger. Despite claiming to
represent workers, the Bolshevik state suppressed workers' councils,
crushed anarchist and socialist opposition, and created a bureaucratic
dictatorship. The Red Army, organized on hierarchical military
principles with appointed commanders and strict discipline, became an
instrument of state power used against workers and peasants.

### People in Arms vs. Standing Army

Anarchists distinguish sharply between the "people in arms" and a
standing army. A standing army constitutes a permanent hierarchical
institution separate from the general population, typically commanded by
specialized officers and bound by military discipline. Such forces can
become instruments of dictatorship and counter-revolution regardless of
their nominal allegiance.

The CNT's 1936 resolution warned: "It must be remembered that a standing
army constitutes the greatest danger for the revolution, since its
influence could lead to dictatorship, which would necessarily kill off
the revolution."[^28]

In contrast, the people in arms remain integrated with civilian life.
Militia members work in factories, fields, and communities when not
actively engaged in defense. They maintain direct connections with the
populations they defend and cannot easily be turned against
revolutionary gains.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Coordination Without Hierarchy

Critics argue that anarchist military organization lacks the
coordination necessary for large-scale operations. However, historical
examples demonstrate that federalist structures can achieve effective
coordination while maintaining autonomy. The key lies in voluntary
agreement to common plans, shared understanding of strategic goals, and
flexible adaptation to circumstances.

The challenge remains real: achieving unified action without coercive
command requires higher levels of political consciousness, trust, and
communication than hierarchical structures. Success depends on extensive
discussion, delegation to trusted coordinators, and willingness to
subordinate local preferences to collective decisions when necessary.

### Technological Disadvantage

Modern warfare's technological intensity raises questions about whether
decentralized forces can compete with state militaries equipped with
advanced weapons. However, several factors mitigate this concern:

Small arms and basic explosives remain widely available and effective
for defensive operations. Advanced military technology proves less
decisive against determined resistance on familiar terrain, as
demonstrated repeatedly in anti-colonial struggles. Anarchist social
organization may prove better able to adapt technology creatively
without rigid hierarchies limiting innovation.

### Internal Conflict

Anarchist movements have sometimes experienced internal conflicts over
defense strategy. In Spain, debates over militarization, collaboration
with the Republican government, and priorities in fighting fascism
versus making revolution created tensions that weakened the movement.

These conflicts highlight the importance of clear principles, open
discussion, and accountability in revolutionary movements. However, they
also demonstrate that anarchist organizations can sustain internal
disagreement without fragmenting entirely - a strength often overlooked.

### External Pressure

Historical anarchist defense efforts have faced overwhelming external
pressure from multiple enemies simultaneously. The Makhnovists fought
Germans, Austrians, White Russians, Ukrainian nationalists, and
Bolsheviks. The Spanish anarchists faced fascist military forces backed
by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, while supposedly allied with a
Republican government actively working to disarm them and a Communist
Party taking orders from Stalin.

Under such conditions, any movement faces difficult odds. The defeats of
these revolutions do not demonstrate the inadequacy of anarchist defense
methods but rather the need for stronger international solidarity and
better coordination among anti-authoritarian forces globally.

### Preventing State Re-Formation

Beyond defeating immediate military threats, anarchist defense must
address the longer-term danger of new hierarchies emerging from within.
History offers stark examples: the Bolsheviks used the soviets to seize
power and then dismantled them once consolidated; anti-colonial
movements replaced European administrators with local authoritarians.
Military victory does not guarantee revolutionary survival.

Anarchist organizational principles address this directly. Rotation and
recallability of delegates, federation without permanent centralization,
dispersal of functions across multiple non-hierarchical bodies, and
active anti-authoritarian culture all make it structurally difficult for
any individual or faction to reconsolidate power. Anthropologist
Christopher Boehm's cross-cultural study of egalitarian societies found
that the decisive factor in maintaining statelessness was not material
conditions but a conscious, collective determination that no member
should be allowed to dominate others.[^29]

This is why the CNT's warnings against standing armies were not merely
ideological but strategic: a permanent military institution, even one
created to defend a revolution, concentrates precisely the kind of
coercive capacity that enables the seizure of power. The people in arms,
remaining integrated with civilian life and accountable to their
communities, cannot easily be turned against revolutionary gains. See
<a href="Preventing_State_Re-Formation" class="wikilink"
title="Preventing State Re-Formation">Preventing State Re-Formation</a>
for a detailed treatment.

## Relationship to Community Self-Defense

Large-scale revolutionary defense and
<a href="Community_Self-Defense" class="wikilink"
title="community self-defense">community self-defense</a> represent
different scales and contexts of anarchist protection, though they share
fundamental principles.

Community self-defense typically addresses immediate local threats -
police violence, fascist attacks, displacement - through neighborhood
patrols, copwatch programs, rapid response teams, and survival programs.
It operates within existing society as part of
<a href="Dual_Power" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>
strategies, building autonomous capacity while resisting oppression.

Revolutionary defense operates at the scale of defending entire
territories, revolutions, and transformed societies from organized
military aggression. It requires sustained military campaigns, federated
coordination across regions, and comprehensive logistical systems.
Revolutionary defense assumes a context where social transformation is
already underway and requires protection from forces seeking to crush
it.

Both scales require voluntary participation, horizontal organization,
popular support, and integration with broader revolutionary goals.
Defense committees, militias, and revolutionary organizations during
revolutions often emerge from pre-existing community self-defense
networks, as communities that have already organized protection against
police and fascists prove better prepared to defend revolutionary gains.

Contemporary anarchist organizing should develop both capacities:
immediate community protection against current threats, and
theoretical/practical preparation for defending revolutionary
transformations should they occur.

## Contemporary Relevance

Modern anarchist defense theory continues to evolve, addressing
contemporary challenges including surveillance technology, drone
warfare, cyber operations, and asymmetric warfare against
technologically superior forces. Theorists emphasize:

**Security culture** to protect against infiltration and surveillance
while maintaining revolutionary transparency and accountability.

**International solidarity** as the primary defense against state power,
recognizing that isolated revolutionary movements face overwhelming
odds.

**Dual power** strategies that build autonomous institutions and defense
capabilities within existing society, creating foundations for
revolutionary transformation. This includes developing
<a href="Community_Self-Defense" class="wikilink"
title="community self-defense">community self-defense</a> capacities
that could scale up if revolutionary opportunities emerge.

**Intersection with other struggles** including anti-colonial
resistance, indigenous sovereignty movements, and popular uprisings
against authoritarianism worldwide.

Contemporary study of anarchist defense focuses on learning from
historical examples while adapting principles to current conditions. The
successful defense of territory by movements like Rojava demonstrates
continuing relevance of anarchist defense principles, while defeats of
past revolutions highlight the necessity of stronger international
coordination.

## Criticism

### Marxist Critiques

Marxist-Leninists argue that anarchist defense is inadequate against
organized state power and that revolutionary discipline requires a
centralized military apparatus. Engels claimed that military
organization inherently requires hierarchy and that
"anti-authoritarianism" in warfare is absurd.

Anarchists respond that confusing coordination with hierarchy
misrepresents anarchist positions. Voluntary coordination through
federation differs fundamentally from imposed command structures.
Moreover, Marxist-Leninist states have repeatedly used their militaries
to crush workers' movements and establish bureaucratic dictatorships,
validating anarchist warnings about revolutionary states.

### Pacifist Critiques

Some pacifists argue that anarchist acceptance of defensive violence
contradicts commitments to non-coercion. However, most anarchists
distinguish between aggressive violence imposing authority and defensive
action protecting freedom. As Berkman argued, defense of liberty against
attack is consistent with anarchist principles.

Nevertheless, pacifist anarchists have contributed important insights
about nonviolent resistance, civil disobedience, and the risks of
militarization even in revolutionary movements.

### Primitivist Critiques

Anarcho-primitivists question whether complex defense organizations can
avoid recreating hierarchies and divisions of labor that enable
domination. They point to indigenous societies that maintained freedom
without specialized military structures.

However, the scale and technological capacities of modern states create
qualitatively different challenges than faced by small-scale societies.
Contemporary anarchist defense must address these realities while
learning from indigenous resistance practices.
