> For example, major protests, boycotts, and acts of sabotage against
> Shell Oil were coordinated among people in Nigeria, Europe, and the
> North America throughout the 1980s and ’90s. In 1986, autonomists in
> Denmark carried out multiple simultaneous fire bombings of Shell
> stations across the country during a worldwide boycott to punish Shell
> for supporting the government responsible for apartheid in South
> Africa. In the Netherlands, the clandestine anti-authoritarian group
> RARA (Revolutionary Anti-Racist Action) carried out a campaign of
> nonlethal bombings against Shell Oil, playing a crucial role in
> forcing Shell to pull out of South Africa. In 1995, when Shell wanted
> to dump an old oil rig in the North Sea, it was forced to abandon its
> plans by protests in Denmark and the UK, an occupation of the oil rig
> by Greenpeace activists, and a fire bombing and a shooting attack
> against Shell stations in two different cities in Germany as well as a
> boycott that lowered sales by ten percent in that country.[^1] Efforts
> such as these prefigure the decentralized global networks that could
> protect the environment in an anarchist future. If we succeed in
> abolishing capitalism and the state, we will have removed the greatest
> systemic ravagers of the environment as well as the structural
> barriers that currently impede popular action in defense of nature.
