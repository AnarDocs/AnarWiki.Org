# Crypto-Anarchy

**Crypto-anarchy**, **crypto-anarchism**, **cyberanarchy** or
**cyberanarchism**[^1] is a political ideology that emerged in the late
1980s focusing on the use of "<a   href="cryptography.md" class="wikilink"
title="cryptography">cryptography</a> and
"<a   href="computer_networks.md" class="wikilink"
title="computer networks">computer networks</a> to undermine state
control and enable autonomous communities in
"<a   href="cyberspace.md" class="wikilink" title="cyberspace">cyberspace</a>.
While often associated with "<a   href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarianism">libertarianism</a> and
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>, crypto-anarchism
represents an important strand of technological resistance to state
surveillance and control, though its relationship to traditional
anarchist theory remains contested.

## Overview

Crypto-anarchism centres on the belief that
"<a   href="cryptographic_software.md" class="wikilink"
title="cryptographic software">cryptographic software</a> can protect
"<a   href="privacy.md" class="wikilink" title="privacy">privacy</a>, enable
"<a   href="freedom_of_speech.md" class="wikilink"
title="freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, and facilitate economic
exchanges beyond state regulation. The ideology was formally articulated
by
"<a   href="Timothy_C._May.md" class="wikilink" title="Timothy C. May">Timothy
C. May</a> in his 1988 "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto", which he read at
the founding meeting of the
"<a   href="cypherpunk.md" class="wikilink" title="cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a>
movement in 1992.[^2] May's manifesto promised encrypted exchanges
ensuring total
"<a   href="anonymity.md" class="wikilink" title="anonymity">anonymity</a>,
total freedom of speech, and total freedom to trade.

The prefix "crypto-" originates from the Ancient Greek word *κρυπτός*
(kruptós), meaning "hidden" or "secret". Unlike its use in terms like
'crypto-fascist' where it signifies concealment of identity,
crypto-anarchists are typically open about their advocacy for
cryptology-based tools.[^3]

## Origins

Crypto-anarchism emerged in the late 1980s within technical communities
concerned about growing state surveillance capabilities. The movement
gained momentum through the
"<a   href="cypherpunk.md" class="wikilink" title="cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a>
mailing list, where programmers, cryptographers, and political activists
discussed ways to use technology to protect individual liberty and
resist government control.

Timothy C. May's foundational work drew on earlier
"<a   href="cyberpunk.md" class="wikilink" title="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>
fiction and growing concerns about computer surveillance. In "The
Cyphernomicon" (1994), May outlined how cryptography could fundamentally
alter power relations between states and individuals, writing:

"Some of us believe various forms of strong cryptography will cause the
power of the state to decline, perhaps even collapse fairly abruptly. We
believe the expansion into cyberspace, with secure communications,
digital money, anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated
interactions, will profoundly change the nature of economies and social
interactions. Governments will have a hard time collecting taxes,
regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations (small ones at
least), and generally coercing folks when it can't even tell what
*continent* folks are on!"[^4]

The movement's growth paralleled increasing awareness of state
surveillance programmes, including
"<a   href="ECHELON.md" class="wikilink" title="ECHELON">ECHELON</a>, and
later revelations about
"<a   href="PRISM_(surveillance_program).md" class="wikilink"
title="PRISM">PRISM</a>,
"<a   href="Tempora.md" class="wikilink" title="Tempora">Tempora</a>, and
other "<a   href="mass_surveillance.md" class="wikilink"
title="mass surveillance">mass surveillance</a> systems.

## Tendencies

### Anti-Surveillance Resistance

A primary motive of crypto-anarchists is defending against
"<a   href="computer_surveillance.md" class="wikilink"
title="surveillance of computer networks">surveillance of computer
networks</a>. This tendency emphasises protecting against government
mass surveillance through the development and deployment of
"<a   href="cryptography.md" class="wikilink"
title="cryptography">cryptography</a>. Crypto-anarchists view encryption
as the main defense against state monitoring of communications,
financial transactions, and online activities.[^5]

### Anonymous Trading and Cryptocurrencies

"<a   href="Bitcoin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and other
"<a   href="cryptocurrencies.md" class="wikilink"
title="cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a> have been embraced by
crypto-anarchists as tools for economic activity beyond state control.
"<a   href="Bitcoin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> operates
through peer-to-peer networked devices maintaining a communal record of
transactions. Adrian Chen, writing for *The New York Times*, traces
bitcoin's ideological origins to *The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto*.[^6]

The "<a   href="Silk_Road_(marketplace).md" class="wikilink"
title="Silk Road">Silk Road</a> marketplace, which exclusively used
bitcoin, exemplified crypto-anarchist principles of anonymous trading,
though it also demonstrated how such systems can facilitate harmful
activities. Similarly,
"<a   href="Assassination_market#Assassination_Market.md" class="wikilink"
title="Assassination Market">Assassination Market</a>, operated by a
self-described crypto-anarchist using the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro,
represented the darker possibilities of unregulated anonymous
systems.[^7]

### Virtual and Network States

Some crypto-anarchists advocate for "network states" - theoretical
communities of internet-connected users who could achieve recognition as
sovereign entities. This concept, explored by Timothy May in his 1992
article *Libertaria in Cyberspace*,[^8] envisions multiple virtual
"nations" existing simultaneously, allowing for "rapid experimentation,
self-selection, and evolution".

Cypherpunk Jerry Everard examined these ideas through Foucauldian
philosophy in his 1999 book *Virtual States*, analysing how virtual
states might disaggregate elements of the nation-state apparatus.
However, he concluded that states would not face extinction, only
diminished power in some areas.[^9]

"<a   href="Balaji_Srinivasan.md" class="wikilink"
title="Balaji Srinivasan">Balaji Srinivasan</a> further developed this
concept in his 2022 book *The Network State: How to Start Your Own
Country*, defining a network state as "a highly aligned online community
with a capacity for collective action that crowdfunds territory around
the world and eventually gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing
states."[^10] His work explicitly connects to

title="Frederick Jackson Turner">Frederick Jackson Turner</a>'s
"<a   href="Frontier_thesis.md" class="wikilink"

## Criticism

### Relationship to Anarchism

The relationship between crypto-anarchism and traditional anarchist
thought is deeply contested. Many scholars argue that crypto-anarchism's
ideological foundations are closer to
"<a   href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarianism">libertarianism</a> and
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> than to social
anarchism:

"However, it is different in the case of crypto-anarchism. It is a
thought and activity not based on anarchism of the turn of the 20th
century, in which the idea of freedom had a social dimension. Freedom in
anarchism of that time was treated as a value manifested in and towards
other people, rather than in competition between individuals.
Crypto-anarchism therefore has a different – libertarian – genesis, and
libertarianism is not treated by social anarchists as anarchism."[^12]

Classical anarchist theory emphasises collective liberation,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and the social dimensions of freedom. In contrast, crypto-anarchism
often centres on individual autonomy, market mechanisms, and
technological solutions to political problems. Timothy C. May explicitly
positioned crypto-anarchism as "a form of anarcho-capitalist market
system", diverging significantly from anti-capitalist anarchist
traditions.[^13]

### Limited Political Impact

A 2022 study found that crypto-anarchism "does not have a significant
influence on actual politics", though studying it may be useful for
understanding online political movements.[^14] This raises questions
about whether crypto-anarchism represents genuine political praxis or
primarily serves as an ideological framework for technical communities.

### Individualism vs Collective Liberation

From a social anarchist perspective, crypto-anarchism's emphasis on
individual technological solutions and market-based organisation
neglects the collective, social nature of liberation. While encryption
tools can protect individuals from surveillance, they do not address
underlying power structures, wealth inequality, or the need for
collective struggle against oppression. The focus on individual "exit"
through technology may undermine efforts to build solidarity and
transform society.

### Enabling Harm

Critics note that crypto-anarchist technologies have been used to
facilitate harmful activities, including illegal drug markets, weapons
trading, and even murder-for-hire schemes. While crypto-anarchists argue
that freedom includes the freedom to make choices others disapprove of,
anarchist ethics typically emphasises harm reduction and collective
wellbeing alongside individual liberty.

## Anarchist Applications

Despite its libertarian origins, crypto-anarchist tools have value for
anarchist organising. Encryption protects activists from state
surveillance, enabling secure communication for
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
networks, and resistance movements.
"<a   href="Cryptocurrencies.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrencies</a> can facilitate
"<a   href="solidarity_economy.md" class="wikilink"
title="solidarity economics">solidarity economics</a> and cross-border
mutual aid outside of state-controlled financial systems.

Anarchists can critically engage with crypto-anarchist technologies
while rejecting the ideology's individualist and capitalist elements.
The goal should be using these tools to strengthen collective resistance
and build "<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative">prefigurative</a> structures rather than simply
creating parallel markets or enabling individual "exit" from society.
