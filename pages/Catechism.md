# Anarchist Catechisms

## Overview

A catechism is a summary of principles, typically in question-and-answer
format, used for religious instruction in Christian traditions.
"<a   href="Anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchists">Anarchists</a>
have adapted this pedagogical form to articulate anarchist principles
and revolutionary theory, often ironically appropriating the
authoritarian structure of religious catechisms to communicate
anti-authoritarian ideas.

Anarchist catechisms serve multiple purposes: providing accessible
introductions to anarchist thought, establishing shared principles
within revolutionary organizations, and creating programmatic statements
for coordinated action. Unlike religious catechisms that demand
obedience to doctrine, anarchist catechisms generally present principles
meant to inspire independent thought and voluntary association.

## Historical Examples

### Bakunin's Revolutionary and National Catechisms (1866)

"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> authored both the
**Revolutionary Catechism** and **National Catechism** in 1866 while
living in Italy, as part of the program for his secret International
Revolutionary Association (also known as the International
Fraternity).[^1] These documents, along with *The International Family*,
outlined the fundamental tenets of Bakunin's
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> and
have been described as "the spiritual foundation of the entire anarchist
movement."[^2]

The Revolutionary Catechism addressed immediate practical problems of
revolution, sketching both fundamental libertarian principles and a
program of action. It proclaimed that "replacing the cult of God by
respect and love of humanity, we proclaim human reason as the only
criterion of truth; human conscience as the basis of justice; individual
and collective freedom as the only source of order in society."[^3] The
document advocated for
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
abolition of the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>, workers'
associations, and the radical transformation of society from the bottom
up.

The National Catechism focused on the necessity of
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a> coordinated across
national boundaries, arguing that "no revolution can succeed in any
country if it is not at the same time both a political and a social
revolution."[^4]

These works should not be confused with Nechayev's later catechism, with
which Bakunin had limited and contentious involvement.

### Nechayev's Revolutionary Catechism (1869)

The ***Catechism of a Revolutionary*** was written by Russian
revolutionary "<a   href="Sergey_Nechayev.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sergey Nechayev">Sergey Nechayev</a> in 1869, with disputed
involvement from Bakunin.[^5] This document presents a dramatically
different vision than Bakunin's earlier works, depicting the
revolutionary as "a doomed man" who "has no personal interests, no
business affairs, no emotions, no attachments, no property, and no
name."[^6]

The text advocates ruthless dedication to revolutionary destruction,
stating that "the revolutionary despises all doctrines and refuses to
accept the mundane sciences" except "the science of destruction."[^7] It
prescribes manipulative tactics toward different categories of people
and promotes amoral instrumentalism in service of revolution.

Publication of this document in 1871 became one of the most dramatic
events in establishing the "<a   href="nihilist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="nihilist movement">nihilist movement</a> in Russia.[^8] However,
the work's advocacy of deception, manipulation, and complete disregard
for individual autonomy stands in sharp contrast to anarchist principles
of voluntary association and individual liberty.

In a letter to Nechayev, Bakunin himself criticized the document, asking
"You remember how you were angry with me, when I called you
"<a   href="abrek.md" class="wikilink" title="abrek">abrek</a> and called your
Catechism the Catechism of abreks?"[^9] This suggests Bakunin viewed the
work as banditry rather than genuine revolutionary anarchism.

### A Catechism of Anarchy (1902)

**A Catechism of Anarchy** was published anonymously in 1902 by the
Social Science Club in Philadelphia, a working-class anarchist reading
and discussion group established by
"<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> and others.[^10]
Mary Hansen wrote the first draft, with the final version completed
collectively by the membership including de Cleyre, Natasha Notkin,
George Brown, and Perle McLeod.[^11]

This catechism uses traditional question-and-answer format to introduce
anarchist principles accessibly. It defines anarchism as "a social
theory which regards the union of order with the absence of all direct
government of man by man as the political ideal; absolute individual
liberty."[^12] The work explains how government creates criminals
through economic injustice, describes different anarchist economic
schools
("<a   href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialist">socialist</a>,
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist">individualist</a>,
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="communist">communist</a>, and
"<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualist">mutualist</a>),
and addresses common questions about violence, marriage, religion, and
social organization.

The catechism emphasizes that anarchism has "a spiritual as well as an
economic gospel" and appeals fundamentally "to the feeling of universal
human love."[^13] It distinguishes between passive and active resistance
while maintaining that "Anarchism is the negation of violence."[^14]

### The Decalogue as Revised (1894)

**The Decalogue as Revised** by Adam Anarchist appeared in
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>'s
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">individualist anarchist</a> journal
*Liberty* on June 30, 1894.[^15] This brief piece satirically
reformulates the
"<a   href="Ten_Commandments.md" class="wikilink" title="Ten Commandments">Ten
Commandments</a> from an anarchist perspective:

> I. Thou shalt have no gods save Liberty, Reason, and Justice.
>
> II\. Thou shalt not take unto thee any legal image, for instance, a
> wife.
>
> III\. Thou shalt pay no taxes, nor collect them.
>
> IV\. The Sabbath exists for thee, not thou for it, therefore thou
> shalt on that as on all other days follow faithfully thy ego's
> promptings.
>
> V. Honor render to all to whom it is due—mayhap to thy parents. But
> let not filial affection blind thee to the fact that the vast majority
> of the race are strangers to Reason, without ability to perceive or
> strength to practise any rational policy.
>
> VI\. Thou shalt not kill aught save superstition, error, and
> privilege.
>
> VII\. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Adultery is the sexual union of
> two persons, either of whom is repulsive to the other.
>
> VIII\. Thou shalt not permit others to steal from thee, nor shalt thou
> steal from others.
>
> IX\. Thou shalt not bear false witness respecting things of the earth
> which thou understandest, nor respecting things above the earth of
> which thou knowest nothing.
>
> X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, unless she also covet
> thee.[^16]

This irreverent reformulation embodies
"<a   href="egoism.md" class="wikilink" title="egoist">egoist</a> and
individualist anarchist principles while mockingly appropriating
religious authority to undermine it.

## Contemporary Usage

The catechism format has fallen largely out of use in contemporary
anarchist organizing, replaced by manifestos, zines, and digital media.
However, the pedagogical impulse behind catechisms—making anarchist
principles accessible to newcomers—continues through introductory texts,
frequently asked questions documents, and educational materials produced
by anarchist groups.

The question-and-answer format occasionally resurfaces in anarchist
primers and educational resources, though rarely under the explicit
label "catechism" due to its religious connotations and the
authoritarian implications of prescriptive doctrine.

## Critical Perspectives

### Tensions with Anarchist Principles

The catechism format presents inherent tensions with anarchist
principles. Catechisms traditionally function as tools of
indoctrination, demanding memorization and acceptance of established
doctrine—fundamentally at odds with anarchist emphasis on critical
thinking, individual autonomy, and rejection of imposed authority.
Anarchist catechisms attempt to resolve this tension by presenting
principles as starting points for reflection rather than dogma, though
the format itself suggests authoritative answers.

### The Nechayev Problem

Nechayev's *Revolutionary Catechism* continues to generate controversy
within anarchist discourse. Critics of
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> have argued that the
document reflects "the innately violent and
"<a   href="nihilism.md" class="wikilink" title="nihilistic">nihilistic</a>
nature of the philosophy."[^17] However, most anarchists reject this
characterization, noting that Nechayev's advocacy of manipulation,
deception, and instrumental treatment of individuals directly
contradicts core anarchist commitments to voluntary association, mutual
respect, and individual autonomy.

The document's influence extended beyond anarchist circles.
"<a   href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther">Black Panther</a>
"<a   href="Eldridge_Cleaver.md" class="wikilink"
title="Eldridge Cleaver">Eldridge Cleaver</a> adopted the catechism as a
"revolutionary bible," employing "tactics of ruthlessness in my dealings
with everyone with whom I came into contact."[^18] This appropriation by
authoritarian revolutionary movements demonstrates the document's
departure from anarchist principles.
