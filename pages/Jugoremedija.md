Jugoremedija is a pharmeceutical factory in Zrenjanin, Serbia that
striking employees occupied from December 2003 to September 2004,
subsequently winning in court a right to self-management. The workers
protested the state's illegal changes in the early 2000s to the
factory's ownership structure, which gave the private capitalist Jovica
Stefanovic some 68% ownership of the factory and reduced the workers'
share down from 58% to 32%. Stefanovic's public relations team
complained the workers' occupation was “a rebellion, a state of
anarchy”. His private army tried several times to remove the workers.

In September 2004, Stefanovic's army and state police finally succeeded
in evicting the workers, who were illegally fired and charged with
disturbing the peace. However, in the summer of 2006, Serbian courts
ruled that the state's ownership structure changes were illegal and
restored the workers' 58 percent ownership in the factory. The workers
announced plans to “begin work in our democratically run factory under
worker control.”

In 2004, the workers joined with other factories and formed the Union of
Workers and Shareholders of Serbia, which opposed privatization and
called for a new state constitution allowing people to practice
participatory governance through constituent assemblies.[^1]
