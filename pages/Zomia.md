## Overview

**Zomia**, also known as the **Southeast Asian Massif**, is a region in
the highlands of Southeast Asia, covering 2.5 million square kilometers
and home to between 80 million and 100 million people. Zomia means
"highlander" in several Tibeto-Burman languages. Political scientist
<a href="James_C._Scott" class="wikilink" title="James C. Scott">James
C. Scott</a> argues that it is "the largest remaining region of the
world whose peoples have not yet been fully incorporated into
nation-states. Its days are numbered."[^1]

Scott argues that these <a href="stateless_societies" class="wikilink"
title="stateless societies">stateless societies</a>' decentralized
organizational forms, choice of what crops to grow, choice of where to
live, and even their emphasis on oral culture all reflect centuries and
centuries of strategically evading capture by the lowland states.
Contrary to some scholars' description of the region's societies as
"primitive," it is possible to understand Zomia as a space where people
intentionally escape from the rule of the state. An elder of the
region's Karen ethnicity explains the mentality of living up in the
mountains where states have trouble reaching: "If we have to run, we
will run up into the hills."[^2]

## History

### Anti-State Origins

Zomia represents a conscious rejection of state authority spanning over
two millennia. Rather than being "primitive" societies left behind by
civilization, the hill peoples are "best understood as runaway,
fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia,
been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the
valleys—slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and
warfare."[^3]

The region's formation as an anarchist space was fundamentally shaped by
what Scott terms the "friction of terrain" - the natural barriers that
mountains and dense forests provided against state penetration. Unlike
the rice-growing valleys where states could easily control sedentary
populations, the highlands offered refuge for those seeking to escape
state domination.[^4]

### Strategies of State Avoidance

The peoples of Zomia developed sophisticated strategies to remain
outside state control. These included:

- **Mobile agriculture**:
  <a href="Slash-and-burn_agriculture" class="wikilink"
  title="Slash-and-burn agriculture">Slash-and-burn agriculture</a> and
  the cultivation of crops like sweet potatoes and cassava that could be
  harvested quickly and stored underground
- **Oral traditions**: Deliberate rejection of written language to avoid
  the bureaucratic apparatus of states
- **Flexible identities**: Fluid ethnic identities that could be adapted
  based on political circumstances
- **Dispersed settlement patterns**: Social organization suited for
  quick dispersal and reunification during conflicts

As Scott notes, "everything about such societies — from the crops they
grow to their kinship systems — can be read as anti-authoritarian social
strategies."[^5]

### State-Repelling Characteristics

The hill societies developed what Scott describes as "state-repelling"
characteristics. Their social organization was intentionally designed to
prevent the emergence of centralized authority that could be co-opted by
external states. This included kinship systems based on "overlapping and
redundant relationships that create a strong social network and limit
the formalization of power."[^6]

## Culture

Zomia has hundreds of ethnic identities and at least five language
families.[^7] Between men and women, Zomia's stateless upland societies
tend to have a "rough egalitarianism which, not incidentally, includes a
relatively higher status for women than in the valleys."[^8]

The cultural diversity of Zomia was not accidental but served
anti-authoritarian purposes. The proliferation of languages,
ethnicities, and cultural practices created what Scott calls
"ethnographic chaos" that frustrated state attempts at classification
and control. Hill peoples frequently spoke multiple languages and
belonged to multiple ethnicities, making them difficult for states to
categorize and administer.[^9]

### Oral Culture as Resistance

The preference for oral over written culture was a deliberate choice to
maintain flexibility and resist state bureaucratization. Without written
records and specialized scribes, "history became common property, rather
than a tool for indoctrination."[^10] Many tribes have legends about how
writing was once known but was deliberately lost or abandoned during
escapes from state authority.

### Anti-Hierarchical Organization

Following the model described by anthropologist
<a href="Pierre_Clastres" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre Clastres">Pierre Clastres</a>, Zomian societies were
organized to prevent the emergence of permanent political authority.
They maintained what Clastres called "societies against the state" -
social formations that actively worked to prevent the concentration of
power that could lead to state formation or collaboration with external
states.

## Economy

While the lowland states relied on sedentary crops such as irrigated wet
rice, Zomia's farmers preferred much more mobile slash-and-burn
agriculture and selected crops such as sweet potatoes and cassava,
maize, and cardamom that required minimal labor, could be harvested at
leisure, were hard to destroy, and could be stored underground for years
while remaining edible.[^11] They supplemented this subsistence farming
with gathering and hunting.[^12] The hill societies "are, almost
invariably, redistributive."[^13]

### Stateless Irrigation

Despite finding irrigated wet rice to be a state-friendly crop, Scott
rejects Karl Wittfogel's hydraulic hypothesis that irrigation
automatically necessitates states. Scott observes Zomia's history of
<a href="stateless_irrigation" class="wikilink"
title="stateless irrigation">stateless irrigation</a>:

[^14]

### Fugitive Agriculture

The agricultural practices of Zomia were specifically chosen to
frustrate state control. Rather than the concentrated, easily taxable
rice cultivation of the valleys, hill peoples practiced what Scott calls
"fugitive agriculture" - mobile farming methods that could not be easily
monitored, taxed, or destroyed by state forces. This included the
strategic choice of tubers that could remain hidden underground and
crops that matured at different times, making systematic extraction
difficult.[^15]

## Organisation

Zomian societies were organized around principles that actively
prevented state formation. Their kinship systems created horizontal
networks rather than vertical hierarchies, and their political
organization was designed for rapid dispersal and reaggregation in
response to external threats.

The absence of permanent chiefs or centralized authority was not a sign
of primitive organization but a conscious choice to prevent the
emergence of intermediaries who might collaborate with state powers.
This organizational principle reflected what Pierre Clastres identified
as the "refusal of unification" - the active process of preventing the
emergence of centralized political authority.[^16]

## Relationship with Lowland States

The relationship between Zomia and the surrounding valley states was
complex and symbiotic. While Zomians sought to avoid state control, they
maintained trade relationships with lowland societies, providing forest
products and serving as sources of labor during times of conflict.

Lowland populations often viewed hill peoples as "living ancestors" -
representations of what valley societies had been before adopting
sedentary agriculture and state organization. However, this narrative
obscured the reality that many hill peoples were actually "post-state"
rather than "pre-state" - refugees from state systems rather than
societies that had never encountered them.[^17]

A Burmese proverb captured the asymmetrical nature of this relationship:
"It is easy for a subject to find a lord, but hard for a lord to find a
subject." The primary goal of warfare in Southeast Asia was often not
territorial conquest but the capture of people, as populations
frequently "ran for the hills to create egalitarian societies."[^18]

## Decline and Incorporation

The autonomy of Zomia began to erode significantly in the mid-20th
century with the development of "distance-demolishing technologies"
including railroads, roads, aircraft, and telecommunications. These
technologies overcame the "friction of terrain" that had previously
protected hill societies from state penetration.[^19]

Modern nation-states have largely succeeded in incorporating former
Zomian territories through programs of "development" and
"modernization" - contemporary terms for the civilizing missions that
states have always pursued against autonomous populations. What remains
of traditional Zomian culture has often been reduced to tourist
attractions and ethnic minorities within established nation-states.

## Legacy and Significance

Zomia represents one of the largest and most successful examples of
sustained resistance to state authority in human history. For over two
millennia, these societies demonstrated that alternatives to state
organization were not only possible but could thrive in the face of
constant pressure from expanding empires and kingdoms.

The Zomian experience challenges conventional narratives about the
inevitability of state development and the benefits of "civilization."
Rather than representing a backward resistance to progress, Zomian
societies embodied sophisticated strategies for maintaining human
freedom and dignity in the face of predatory state systems.

As political scientist Edward Stringham concludes, stateless societies
like Zomia "have successfully repelled states using location, specific
production methods, and cultural resistance to states" over thousands of
years.[^20]
