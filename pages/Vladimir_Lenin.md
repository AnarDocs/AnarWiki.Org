**Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov** (better known by his alias **Lenin**) was a
Russian revolutionary, politician and political theorist. He was the
first head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 until his death in
1924, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death. As the founder
of the

Lenin led the "<a   href="October_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="October Revolution">"October Revolution</a>, which established the
world's first communist state. His government won the Russian Civil War
and created a one-party state under the Communist Party. Ideologically a
Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called
"<a   href="Leninism.md" class="wikilink" title="Leninism">"Leninism</a>.

## Family

Lenin was born into a middle-class family. His father, Ilya Nikolayevich
Ulyanov, was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church and had risen from
a family of former serfs to middle-class status through education. His
mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (née Blank), came from a wealthy
background with a Swedish Lutheran mother and a Russian Jewish father
who had converted to Christianity.

Lenin was the third of eight children. His older brother
"<a   href="Aleksandr_Ulyanov.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander">"Alexander</a> was executed in May 1887 for plotting to
assassinate Tsar Alexander III, an event which profoundly influenced
Lenin's revolutionary path. He married
"<a   href="Nadezhda_Krupskaya.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nadezhda Krupskaya">"Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>, a fellow Marxist, in
1898 while both were in exile in Siberia.

## Early Life

Lenin was born in Simbirsk on 22 April 1870. Despite the emotional
trauma of his father's death in 1886 and his brother's execution in
1887, Lenin graduated from school at the top of his class with a gold
medal and decided to study law at Kazan University.

Upon entering Kazan University in August 1887, Lenin joined
revolutionary circles. He was expelled from the university in December
for participating in student protests against government restrictions.
He was exiled to his family's estate at Kokushkino, where he read
voraciously, becoming influenced by revolutionary literature.

Lenin's mother eventually convinced the authorities to allow him to take
his law exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he
obtained the equivalent of a first-class degree with honours in 1891. He
worked as a legal assistant but devoted much time to radical politics,
formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia.

## Revolutionary Activity

In late 1893, Lenin moved to Saint Petersburg and rose to a senior
position in a Marxist revolutionary cell. By late 1894, he was leading a
Marxist workers' circle. He began a relationship with Nadezhda
Krupskaya, a Marxist school teacher, whom he later married.

In 1897, Lenin was sentenced without trial to three years' exile in
eastern Siberia. He settled in Shushenskoye, where he was kept under
police surveillance but was able to correspond with other
revolutionaries and write extensively. During this period he completed
his book *The Development of Capitalism in Russia*.

After his exile, Lenin lived in various European cities including
Munich, London, and Geneva, where he became a leading figure in the
Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1903, the party split between
Lenin's
"<a   href="Bolshevik.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevik">"Bolshevik</a>
faction and the
"<a   href="Mensheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Mensheviks">"Mensheviks</a>.

## The October Revolution

After the February Revolution of 1917 ousted Tsar Nicholas II, Lenin
returned to Russia in April 1917. He immediately began campaigning
against the Provisional Government, calling for "All Power to the
Soviets" and advocating immediate peace, land redistribution, and
workers' control of production.

On November 7, 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power in what became known as
the October Revolution. The attack on the Winter Palace was led by
Russian anarchist Bill Shatov. The sailors of Kronstadt, later to be
massacred by the Bolsheviks in 1921, were given pride of place in the
battle.[^1]

## Government and Suppression of Opposition

### Workers' Control

Despite revolutionary rhetoric about workers' power, Lenin quickly moved
to centralize control in the hands of the Bolshevik party. His "Decree
on Workers' Control" of November 14, 1917, did not grant workers actual
control of production, but rather established state supervision over
industry.

As historian M.H. Dobb noted, "The leitmotif running through the
speeches and writings of Lenin in 1917 was the overshadowing importance
of the class which held the actual reins of power. For him this issue
was paramount."[^2] When Bolsheviks used the term "working class," they
meant the Party, which alone claimed the right to speak for workers.

Before the Bolshevik seizure of power, workers across Russia had been
spontaneously taking control of factories. In the summer and autumn of
1917, reports multiplied of workers arresting engineers, expelling
unpopular foremen, and preventing factory closures. Factory committees
were managing production independently. However, Lenin opposed this
genuine workers' control, stating in June 1918: "there are many...who
are not enlightened socialists and cannot be such because they have to
slave in the factories and they have neither the time nor the
opportunity to become socialists."[^3]

Lenin told workers in October 1921: "Get down to business all of you!
You will have capitalists beside you, including foreign capitalists,
concessionaries and leaseholders. They will squeeze profits out of you
amounting to hundreds per cent; they will enrich themselves, operating
alongside of you. Let them, Meanwhile you will learn from them the
business of running an economy."[^4]

Individual managers were appointed from above, piecework was enforced,
factory committees were abolished, and trade unions were brought under
Party and State control. As one contemporary noted, "Many factory
committees went beyond the legal powers awarded to them in the Decree on
Workers' Control and eventually took the administration of factories
into their own hands" - but the Bolshevik government took action against
this "illegal nationalisation."[^5]

### The Red Terror

In September 1918, the government inaugurated the Red Terror, a system
of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police. Although
sometimes described as targeting the bourgeoisie, the Terror's victims
included non-bourgeois anti-Bolsheviks, anarchists, and anyone perceived
as enemies of the government. The Cheka claimed the right to sentence
and execute anyone deemed an enemy without recourse to courts. Later
estimates suggest between 10,000 and 140,000 people perished in the Red
Terror.

Lenin established concentration camps in April 1919, which were
entrusted to the Cheka. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been
established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners. Those
interned were used as slave labour.

### Suppression of the Kronstadt Rebellion

In March 1921, sailors at
"<a   href="Kronstadt.md" class="wikilink" title="Kronstadt">"Kronstadt</a> -
the same sailors who had been celebrated as the "flower of the October
Revolution" - revolted against the Bolshevik government. They demanded
that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade
unions be given freedom of assembly, and that peasants be allowed free
markets. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled and called
for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army put down
the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the
internment of survivors in labour camps.

## Relationship with Anarchists

### Peter Kropotkin

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a>, the renowned anarchist theorist, initially supported the
February Revolution but opposed the Bolshevik seizure of power from the
start. When Kropotkin heard the first cannon volleys of the Bolshevik
uprising in Moscow in November 1917, he exclaimed: "This is the burial
of the Russian Revolution."[^6]

In May 1919, Kropotkin met with Lenin in the Kremlin to plead for the
life of an imprisoned friend and to discuss broader issues of the
revolution. The conversation revealed fundamental differences between
their concepts of revolution. Kropotkin warned Lenin about the dangers
of centralised power and the need to avoid creating a new ruling class.
He stated: "We do not mean to say that the Bolshevik party set out to
create a new class system. But we do say that even the best intentions
and aspirations must inevitably be smashed against the evils inherent in
any system of centralised power."[^7]

Lenin showed Kropotkin considerable respect at this meeting, but their
fundamental disagreement remained. Kropotkin told Lenin: "You and I have
different points of view. Our aims seem to be the same, but as to a
number of questions about means, actions, and organization, I differ
with you greatly."

In subsequent letters, Kropotkin criticized the chaotic condition of the
countryside and warned: "Russia has become a Soviet Republic only in
name.... At present it is ruled not by Soviets but by party
committees.... If the present situation should continue much longer, the
very word 'socialism' will turn into a curse."[^8]

Kropotkin also protested the taking of hostages, writing: "Is it
possible that you do not know what a hostage really is — a man
imprisoned not because of a crime committed but only because it suits
his enemies to exert blackmail on his companions?... If you admit such
methods, one can foresee that one day you will use torture, as was done
in the Middle Ages."[^9]

These letters enraged Lenin, who told an old Bolshevik: "I am sick of
this old fogey. He doesn't understand a thing about politics and
intrudes with his advice, most of which is very stupid."

### Mikhail Bakunin's Prophecy

Forty-five years before the Russian Revolution, the anarchist
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> had warned that
authoritarian socialists would interpret the 'dictatorship of the
proletariat' to mean their own dictatorship, which "would be the rule of
scientific intellect, the most autocratic, the most despotic, the most
arrogant and the most contemptuous of all regimes. They will be a new
class, a new hierarchy of sham savants, and the world will be divided
into a dominant minority in the name of science, and an immense ignorant
majority."[^10]

The anarchist Sergven recorded in 1918 that "The proletariat is being
gradually enserfed by the state. The people are being transformed into
servants over whom there has arisen a new class of administrators — a
new class born mainly from the womb of the so-called
intelligentsia."[^11]

## Death

In March 1923, Lenin had a third stroke and lost his ability to speak.
He died on 21 January 1924 at age 53 at his Gorki mansion. His official
cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood
vessels.

The Soviet government publicly announced Lenin's death the following
day. His body was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum in Red Square,
where it remains on public display.

## Legacy

### The Anarchist Critique

Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of
the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive
personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991.
He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism-Leninism and thus a
prominent influence over the international communist movement.

From an anarchist perspective, Lenin's legacy is one of betrayal of the
revolution and the establishment of a new form of oppression. As
Kropotkin observed, the Bolsheviks used propaganda to hijack slogans
popularised by anarchists and other revolutionaries in order to advance
policies entirely opposed to workers' self-management.[^12]

Anarchists argue that Lenin's concept of revolution fundamentally
contradicted genuine social transformation. His vision of "socialism"
was essentially state capitalism - planned capitalism with private
ownership removed. As Lenin himself wrote: "Socialism is merely the next
step forward from state capitalist monopoly... state capitalist monopoly
which is made to serve the interests of the whole people."[^13]

The anarchist historian Voline concluded that "the seizure of power by
the Bolsheviks was not a revolution, but the counter-revolution. It is
not unusual for the counter-revolution to masquerade as the revolution;
that is its only chance of success."[^14]

Emma Goldman, initially sympathetic to the Bolsheviks, came to see
Lenin's Russia as antithetical to anarchist principles. Despite this,
she noted that Kropotkin, though disappointed, maintained his belief in
the revolutionary potential of the Russian people even under Bolshevik
rule.

The means-ends distinction central to anarchist politics stands in stark
contrast to Lenin's approach. As one analysis noted: "Lenin's 'criterion
of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the
cause of the Revolution?'" - meaning that for Lenin, the end always
justified the means.[^15]
