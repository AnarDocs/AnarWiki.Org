Escaping from life in tyrannical monarchies and market economies, the
seventeenth and eighteenth-century pirates took to plundering merchant
ships in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of
Mexico. Between and within crews, pirates organized themselves in an
egalitarian manner complete with highly democratic constitutions, checks
and balances and a loose confederation of crews. At any given time,
there were an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 pirates and an even larger number
of buccaneers, who were were essentially part-time pirates that spent a
portion of their time engaging in state-sanctioned plundering. A study
of pirate crews between 1716 and 1726 found that the average crew had 80
members, although crews of 150 to 200 members were not uncommon. An
analysis of 23 pirate crews between 1682 and 1726 found that over a
quarter of the average crew was of African descent.[^1]

Aside from the democratically elected captain and quartermaster, all
pirates on a ship received an equal share of the loot. The captain and
quartermaster received up to twice the normal share, but they were
expected to store their wealth and make it available to the crew it
times of need.[^2] Pirates could recall and replace captains for a
number of reasons including corruption, cowardice and poor judgement.
Although the captain assumed full authority in times of chase and
battle, when snap-decisions needed to be made, he had very little to no
coercive power during all other times.[^3] Crews sometimes executed
captains who exceeded their limited authority.[^4] The quartermaster,
who distributed food and loot, adjudicated crew conflicts, and
administered punishment. By separating the powers into two offices,
pirate crews created a system of checks and balances that prevented the
captain from assuming the kinds of autocratic power seen on the merchant
ships.[^5]

Written constitutions called "articles of agreement" set rules for the
ship and specified the limits of the authority of the captain, the
quartermaster and other officers. The crew had to reach full consensus
to approve the articles. Articles from Captain Robert's ship laid out
guidelines for how to make decisions (by majority vote), how to settle
disputes (by duel), and how to distribute loot (officers get one
and-a-quarter to two shares, everyone else gets one share). The articles
also stipulated rules against stealing from other members, striking one
another at sea, and bringing women onto the ship. Punishments included
banishment, slitting of the ears and nose, and death.[^6]

Although a "substantial minority" of pirates traded slaves, free
Africans and African Amerericans, including ex-slaves, were common on
pirate ships. "Negroes and Molattoes" are recorded "on almost every
pirate ship," and only rarely as slaves, according to Peter Linebaugh
and Marcus Rediker.[^7].

The egalitarian structure proved to be pretty effective at keeping peace
eternally. David Graeber observes that "pirates, despite being
constantly armed and frequently drunk, virtually never came to blows
with one another."[^8]

There were some women pirates, including Anne Bonny and Mary Read, who
"cursed and swore like sailors, carried their weapons like those well
trained in the ways of war, and boarded prize vessels as only the most
daring and respected members of pirate crews were permitted to do."[^9]

# Pirate Land Bases

Pirates created stateless, egalitarian base communities on land.

## Bahamas

One prominent base existed on New Providence in Nassau, Bahamas from
1716 to 1718. Gabriel Kuhn cites an estimate that the settlement had a
population of 2,000 people including pirates and other residents. There
were no laws or government. Pirates were said to have spent their days
drinking, gambling, sleeping with sex workers, and lying on hammocks.
Frank Sherry describes this temporary pirate utopia:

> A shanty- town—a zany collection of stores, shacks, whorehouses, and
> saloons, cobbled together from driftwood and canvas with palm thatch
> for roofs—stretched in a half circle along the sandy shore of the
> harbor. The wreckage of captured prizes lay rotting on the beach,
> their ribs exposed like long-dead carcasses. Dozens of vessels—pirate
> sloops and captured merchants—crowded the harbor, their masts looked
> like a leafless forest from the shore. In this place, their own crazy
> metropolis, the pirates of the western world drank, argued among
> themselves, gambled away fortunes, paid in stolen coin for the bodies
> of the prostitutes who flocked to the town, and lived in an uproarious
> present until their coin was gone and they had to go to sea once more.
> It was said that the stench from Nassau—a combination of roasting
> meat, smoke, human offal, rum, unwashed bodies, and rotting gar- bage,
> all stewing together under the tropical sun—could be detected far out
> to sea, long before the island itself was visible. New Providence and
> its wild harbor town were in many ways a pirate heaven as well as a
> pirate haven. Free from all laws other than the laws of piracy, it
> made available all the rough joys that the outlaw brotherhood held
> dear.[^10]

## Madagascar

In 1697, a pirate crew and their Malagasgy wives and neighbors jointly
established the community of Ambonavola which, according to Graeber,
represented "an attempt to apply the democratic principles of
organization typical of pirate ships to a settled community on
land."[^11] When a dispute arose, pirates poured liquor onto the ground,
sacrificing it to the Devil. Then, both parties in the dispute were
summoned to meet at Captain North's house for the conflict to be judged
by the captain and twelve assistant judges chosen by lot. The punishment
was usually a fine.[^12]

Hakim Bey describes Ranter's Bay, another pirate's enclave in
Madagascar:

> One such utopia was founded at “Ranter's Bay”-a place-name which, as
> C. Hill points out, lends some credence to the assumption that radical
> antinomian sects may have found adherents amongst the pirates \[Hill,
> 1985\]. according to Daniel Defoe's The King of the pirates (1720),
> Capt. Avery himself settled for a while in Madagascar as a
> “mock-king”. Hill points out that “Defoe stressed the libertarian
> aspects of Avery's settlement. 'In a free state, as we were, everybody
> was free to go wherever they would.”' \[ibid. p. 178\][^13]

In Bey's account quoted below, Libertalia features prominently, even
though most historians agree Libertalia was fictional due to a lack of
historical and archeological evidence aside from a single 1724
book.[^14]

> After the fall of Tortuga, the Buccaneer ideal remained alive all
> through the “Golden Age” of Piracy (ca. 1660–1720), and resulted in
> land-settlements in Belize, for example, which was founded by
> Buccaneers. Then, as the scene shifted to Madagascar — an island still
> unclaimed by any imperial power and ruled only by a patchwork of
> native kings (chiefs) eager for pirate allies — the Pirate Utopia
> reached its highest form.
>
> Defoe’s account of Captain Mission and the founding of Liberlatia may
> be, as some historians claim, a literary hoax meant to propagandize
> for radical Whig theory — but it was embedded in *The General History
> of the Pyrates* (1724–28), most of which is still accepted as true and
> accurate. Moreover the story of Capt. Mission was not criticized when
> the book appeared and many old Madagascar hands still survived. They
> seem to have believed it, no doubt because they had experienced pirate
> enclaves very much like Libertalia. Once again, rescued slaves,
> natives, and even traditional enemies such as the Portuguese were all
> invited to join as equals. (Liberating slave ships was a major
> preoccupation.) Land was held in common, representatives elected for
> short terms, booty shared; doctrines of liberty were preached far more
> radical than even those of *Common Sense*.
>
> Libertalia hoped to endure, and Mission died in its defense. But most
> of the pirate utopias were meant to be temporary; in fact the
> corsairs’ true “republics” were their ships, which sailed under
> Articles. The shore enclaves usually had no law at all. The last
> classic example, Nassau in the Bahamas, a beachfront resort of shacks
> and tents devoted to wine, women (and probably boys too, to judge by
> Birge’s *Sodomy and Piracy*), song (the pirates were inordinately fond
> of music and used to hire on bands for entire cruises), and wretched
> excess, vanished overnight when the British fleet appeared in the Bay.
> Blackbeard and “Calico Jack” Rackham and his crew of pirate women
> moved on to wilder shores and nastier fates, while others meekly
> accepted the Pardon and reformed. But the Buccaneer tradition lasted,
> both in Madagascar where the mixed-blood children of the pirates began
> to carve out kingdoms of their own, and in the Caribbean, where
> escaped slaves as well as mixed black/white/red groups were able to
> thrive in the mountains and backlands as “Maroons.” The Maroon
> community in Jamaica still retained a degree of autonomy and many of
> the old folkways when Zora Neale Hurston visited there in the 1920’s
> (see *Tell My Horse*). The Maroons of Suriname still practice African
> “paganism.”[^15]
