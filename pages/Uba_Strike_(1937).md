## Background

In the 1870s, large sugar estates sold off their less productive land to
Indian Mauritians that formed a small class of landowners called
Sirdars. The
<a href="British_Empire" class="wikilink" title="British Empire">British
Empire</a> feared angering the Franco-Mauritian elite for fears the
island might join the
<a href="French_Empire" class="wikilink" title="French Empire">French
Empire</a> again, making it extremely difficult for pro-worker reforms
to be passed. Many farmers planted the hardier but less productive Uba
variety of sugarcane. Although Uba produced more cane by weight it also
had a lower sucrose content than traditional varieties of sugarcane
meaning that the mills would produce less refined sugar from it. Since
the growers of sugarcane were paid by weight the sugar refineries
experienced lower profits whilst the growers were paid more per harvest.
In July 1937, at the beginning of that year's sugarcane harvest, the
sugar refineries announced that they would only accept Uba cane for 15%
less than regular sugarcane. This combined with the depressed state of
the sugar market internationally put great economic strain on growers.

## Events

Following the announcement of the fifteen percent reduction in the Uba
cane price workers on the Rich Fund estate asked the Sirdars or managers
to intervene to raise the price. After getting no satisfaction the
workers went on strike and caused a number of minor disturbances. Due to
<a href="British_Caribbean_Strike_Wave_(1930s)" class="wikilink"
title="similar strikes">similar strikes</a> in the Caribbean at the time
the British government in Mauritius initially sought a conciliatory
approach whilst the Labour Party held rallies calling for political and
economic reform. By mid-August the strikes had spread to other sugar
estates across the island. The government sought to negotiate with the
sugar refineries to increase the price of Uba cane but a few estates
refused. One of the estates that refused to increase the price, the
Union-Flacq estate owned by R.Gujadhur, became the target of arson
attacks and property damage. This along with a suggestion by the police
to deal with their own security lead to the stockpiling of weapons on
the estate.

### Massacre

On the 13th of August 1937 around two hundred small farmers and workers
marched on the refinery at Union-Flacq. Armed staff at the refinery met
the demonstrators who then attempted to storm the facility. Fearing for
their personal safety the staff fired on the demonstrators. The
encounter resulted in the deaths of six protesters and wounding four
more. The protesters dispersed whilst setting fire to surrounding sugar
cane fields. Word spread and protests lasted for an additional two weeks
across the island.

## Results

In 1938, the following reforms were passed in Mauritius:

- Legalisation of
