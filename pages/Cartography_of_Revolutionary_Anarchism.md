# Cartography of Revolutionary Anarchism

**Disclaimer:** This book's author Michael Schmidt has been exposed as
secretly espousing highly reactionary and perhaps even fascist views. As
a result, AK Press has stopped publishing this book and it should be
read with particular caution. For your reference, here are the first two
parts of a 2015 investigative report by Alexander Reid Ross and Joshua
Stephens[^1] and [^2]

## Overview

"Cartography of Revolutionary Anarchism" presents a comprehensive
analysis of anarchist history and theory, arguing that revolutionary
anarchism has provided a profound critique of
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
<a href="landlordism" class="wikilink"
title="landlordism">landlordism</a>, the
<a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>, and power
relations based on gender or race. The book contends that anarchism
offers practical tools for the oppressed to challenge elites and has
significantly shaped class struggle, contributing to fundamental aspects
of civilised society.

A central concept in the work is "counter-power," which represents
concrete projects to dissolve centralist, hierarchical power and replace
it with devolved, free-associative, horizontally federated structures.
This counter-power serves as both a training ground for revolutionary
practice and the nucleus of a future, radically
<a href="egalitarian" class="wikilink"
title="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> society.

The book argues that anarchism emerged as a modern, internationalist,
revolutionary socialist, and militant current within organised
<a href="trade_unions" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade
unions</a>, promoting "socialism-from-below" in contrast to what it
describes as classical
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>'s
"socialism-from-above." It criticises Marxist regimes as historically
authoritarian dictatorships.

## Core Arguments

The book emphasises anarchism's systematic confrontation with racism and
ethnic discrimination, developing an antiracist ethic that influenced
multi-ethnic labour struggles, anti-fascist movements, and indigenous
struggles. It highlights the movement's contemporary relevance by
focusing on its engagement with power dynamics, contrasting the
anarchist ideal of free, horizontal, federalist, proletarian
counter-power with the Marxist concept of seizing coercive state power.

The work explores how the militant minority transmits ideas of a free
society to the oppressed, leading to "libertarian autogestion." Early
anarchists established educational institutions and a proletarian
counter-culture to foster independence from oppressive elites, uniting
diverse groups across racial and gender lines.

## The Five Waves Theory

The book rejects a limited "Five Highlights" view of anarchist history,
which it finds North Atlantic-centric and inadequate. Instead, it
proposes a "Five Waves" theory, charting the movement's rise and fall in
conjunction with objective conditions for the organised popular classes:

### First Wave (1868–1894): The Rise of the Broad Anarchist/Syndicalist Movement

This wave saw the emergence of a distinct anarchist current within the
<a href="First_International" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a>, heavily influenced
by <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>. Significant anarcho- and
revolutionary syndicalist organisations arose in Spain, Mexico, Uruguay,
Cuba, and the US, often eclipsing Marxist groups in size. The period
included experiences like the
<a href="Paris_Commune" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> and Spain's Cantonalist Revolt, which informed future
large-scale anarchist revolutionary projects.

### Second Wave (1895–1923): Consolidation of Syndicalism and Specific Anarchist Organisation

Driven by capitalist expansion, this wave saw
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> emerge explicitly in
Latin America and revolutionary syndicalism in the English-speaking
world. The <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW), formed in 1905 in the US, organised the poorest and
most marginal workers across racial lines. Anarchism gained traction in
Japan, China, and Korea.

The 1907 International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam solidified the
view that anarchy and organisation are complementary, leading to the
formation of specific anarchist political organisations. The
<a href="Mexican_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> (1910) provided a
blueprint for how specific anarchist organisations, syndicalist unions,
and armed worker-peasant militias could operate together. The
culmination was the formation of the
<a href="International_Workers&#39;_Association" class="wikilink"
title="International Workers&#39; Association">International Workers'
Association</a> (IWA) in 1922, representing 1.5 to 2 million
revolutionary workers globally.

### Third Wave (1924–1949): The Anarchist Revolutions Against Imperialism, Fascism, and Bolshevism

This period saw anarchism challenged by Fascism and Bolshevism.
Following defeat in Russia,
<a href="Nestor_Makhno" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a> and
<a href="Pyotr_Arshinov" class="wikilink" title="Pyotr Arshinov">Pyotr
Arshinov</a> published the
<a href="Organisational_Platform" class="wikilink"
title="Organisational Platform">Organisational Platform</a> of the
General Union of Anarchists (1926), calling for tight internal
discipline, unity of ideas and tactics, and dual organisationism.

During the <a href="Spanish_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, the
<a href="Friends_of_Durruti" class="wikilink"
title="Friends of Durruti">Friends of Durruti</a> issued "Towards a
Fresh Revolution" (1938), advocating for a "revolutionary junta" to
maintain the revolutionary character of the war. Key revolutions
demonstrating anarchist influence include the Manchurian Revolution
(1929–1931) and the extensively documented Spanish Revolution
(1936–1939).

### Fourth Wave (1950–1989): Rearguard Actions in the Shadow of the Cold War

Often perceived as a low point, the book argues that anarchism still
played a key role in the <a href="Cuban_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Cuban Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a> within both underground
and official labour movements before Castro's authoritarian shift. The
founding of the influential
<a href="Uruguayan_Anarchist_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Uruguayan Anarchist Federation">Uruguayan Anarchist
Federation</a> (FAU) in 1956 spurred significant organisational growth
in Latin America.

<a href="George_Fontenis" class="wikilink"
title="George Fontenis">George Fontenis</a>'s Manifesto of Libertarian
Communism (1953) advocated for a disciplined "vanguard" whose role was
to develop the masses' political responsibility. This approach became
known as <a href="especifismo" class="wikilink"
title="especifismo">especifismo</a> in Latin America.

### Fifth Wave (1990–Today): The Anarchist Movement's Resurgence

The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a surge of anarchist movements
across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The
<a href="Zapatista" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
Revolt in Chiapas (1994) provided a contemporary model of libertarian
socialist administration and militia. The especifista response saw
significant revival, particularly initiated by the rebuilt FAU in
Uruguay.

This wave has seen a global resurgence of anarcho- and revolutionary
syndicalism, with international organising intensifying through
platforms like anarkismo.net, connecting 33 "anarchist-communist,"
especifista, and platformist-inspired organisations worldwide.

## The Role of the Anarchist Specific Organisation

Throughout its historical analysis, the book consistently advocates for
organisational dualism:

- **Mass organisations**: Broad, heterogeneous organisations of the
  oppressed (unions, communes, militias) that are directly democratic
  and worker-controlled, serving as the basis for counter-power and
  revolutionary change.

<!-- -->

- **Specific political organisations**: Smaller, ideologically
  homogeneous groups of committed anarchists whose role is to
  systematically promote revolutionary ideas, provide theoretical
  clarity, develop strategy, and stimulate the political growth and
  self-management of the masses within the mass organisations.

This dual approach, rooted in Bakunin's ideas and elaborated through
<a href="Platformism" class="wikilink"
title="Platformism">Platformism</a> and especifismo, ensures both mass
participation and strategic coherence in the revolutionary process.

## Critiques

It is crucial for readers to be aware that the author of this book,
Michael Schmidt, has been exposed for secretly holding and espousing
highly reactionary and potentially even fascist views. Due to these
revelations, AK Press, the original publisher, has ceased publishing
this book, and it is advised that readers approach its content with
significant caution.

The exposure of Schmidt's hidden agenda underscores the importance of
critically evaluating the material presented and independently verifying
information, given the profound contradiction between the book's stated
anti-racist and anti-sexist anarchist principles and the author's
alleged personal views. This revelation has led to significant
controversy within anarchist circles about the reliability and
intentions behind the historical analysis presented in the work.

While the book presents extensive historical research and theoretical
frameworks, readers should be aware that the author's concealed
political positions may have influenced the selection, interpretation,
and presentation of historical events and anarchist theory. The
anarchist community has largely distanced itself from Schmidt's work
following these revelations.
