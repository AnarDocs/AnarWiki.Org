Instructed in religion by the seventeenth-century midwife Anne
Hutchinson, a devoted group of unorthodox Puritans formed a network in
Massachusetts and, eventually, established a residential community of
Pocasset (in present-day Rhode Island) with utopian leanings. There,
Hutchinson’s followers practiced religious freedom and, influenced by an
Anabaptist offshoot called Familism, came to reject governmental and
church authority.

Born in England in 1591 and married in 1612, Hutchinson discovered she
was a prophet and came to experience revelations from God. She found
hidden meaning in the Biblical passage Jeremiah 46:27-28, which revealed
to her that God would protect her but destroy England. She and her
husband set sail to Massachusetts in 1634.[^1]

Upon arrival in Boston, Hutchinson delivered twice-weekly lectures to
other women about religion. Men also sought her advice, and Hutchinson
claimed that after a half-hour conversation with any man she could
determine whether he was predestined for heaven. Inspired by Familist
ideas, Hutchinson’s students believed that entering a “covenant of
grace” with God would deliver them to control by the Holy Spirit and
ideally enable them to live a life of never-ending joy.[^2] Since this
divine covenant did not involve mediation from a priest, Hutchinson has
been called an “antinomian” and a “religious individualist.”[^3]
According to biographer Michael Winship, Massachusetts’s often-elected
governor John Wintrhop “portrayed her as a hell-spawned agent of
destructive anarchy.”[^4]

Egalitarian views have been attributed to Hutchinson. Peter Gelderloos
claims that “Anne won popular support for her well argued ideas, which
opposed the slavery of Africans and Native Americans, criticized the
church, and insisted that being born a woman was a blessing and not a
curse.”[^5] Hutchinson’s male followers refused to fight in the
genocidal war against the Pequots, since they determined that the
military chaplain was not in a covenant of grace.[^6] Hutchinson’s
followers were in touch with the progressive theologian Roger Williams
who believed the land belonged to the Indians and thus could not simply
be parceled out by the King of England.[^7]

Hutchinson and her followers found support from Boston’s open-minded
minister John Cotton, who shared some of her radical ideas. Hutchinson
apparently told followers that Cotton was the only decent minister in
the entire Massachusetts Bay Colony.[^8]

In November 1637, the colony’s General Court put Hutchinson on trial for
sedition and slander. Citing divine revelations, Hutchinson dramatically
warned the prosecutors, “\[I\]f you go in this course you begin you will
bring a curse upon you and your posterity.”[^9] The Court sentenced her
to banishment from Massachusetts and imprisonment in the meantime.[^10]

Meanwhile, Roger Williams persuaded Hutchinson’s followers, including
her husband William, to move to Aquidneck (present-day Rhode Island).
Williams convinced the wealthy merchant William Coddington to purchase
the land from Naragansett sachems. There, allies of Hutchinson founded
the settlement of Pocasset and waited for Anne to arrive after her
imprisonment ended.[^11] Himself banished from Massachusetts, Roger
Williams lived in Aquidneck on land he had received from the
Naragansetts. There he had established the settlement of Providence,
which Gelderloos says was "based on the idea of total equality and
freedom of conscience for all inhabitants, and friendly relations with
the indigenous neighbors."[^12] In its early days, Providence had
"virtually no government" according to Rothbard; Williams himself
described a consent-based decision-making process: "The masers of
families have ordinarily met once a fortnight and consulted about our
common peace, watch and plenty; and mutual consent have finished all
matters of speed and pace."[^13]

Under house arrest in Roxbury, Hutchinson kept teaching and sharing her
ideas. The heretic-hunting minister Thomas Shepard visited Hutchinson
and dishonestly told her he was not trying to entrap her. So, she freely
shared her thoughts with him, and he reported those thoughts to her
Boston church. The minister Cotton turned on Hutchinson, and the church
excommunicated her for allegedly lying (about her beliefs) and doctrinal
errors.[^14] Hutchinson remained steadfast and declared, “Better to be
cast out of the Church than to deny Christ.”[^15]

Ordered to leave Massachusetts, Hutchinson went to Pocasset, where she
taught all genders together at Sunday meetings at her house.[^16] In
1639, there was a successful effort to democratize Pocasset, eliminating
oligarchical distinction, instituting jury trial, and separating church
from state. Pocasset was renamed Portsmouth.[^17] Hutchinson may have
been involved or even a leader, but the revolt was led in large part by
Hutchinson's friend Samuel Gorton who "attacked the legitimacy of all
governing magistrates."[^18] Anne’s husband was elected the chief judge,
but she soon persuaded him to give up that post, as Roger Williams
wrote, “because of the opinion which she had newly taken up, of the
unlawfulness of magistry.” Murray Rothbard claims that Hutchinson
arrived at “the ultimate bounds of libertarian thought: to individualist
anarchism. No magistry whatever was lawful.”[^19] Hutchinsons'
descendant and biographer Eve LaPlante describes Anne's "seemingly
anarchic" view that people in whom the Holy Spirit dwelt "cannot be
ruled by a secular authority." The settlement had about 200 families by
1640. They "had become friends" with the Naragansetts.[^20]

The settlement had full religious liberty, and Hutchinson herself
developed an increasingly radical theology. She convinced three or four
families to become Seekers, meaning that they rejected the legitimacy of
all churches that ever existed since the time of the Apostles.[^21]
After Hutchinson’s husband died in 1642, she desired to leave Pocasset,
in part to get further away from Massachusetts officials who now
(according to Rothbard) considered her a witch deserving to die.[^22]
So, that year she and three families purchased land from the
Wecqueasgeek Indians, in the present-day Bronx which was then colonized
by the Dutch. Emphasizing their shared humanity, Hutchinson told the
Wecqueasgeek that she and they were “all one Indian.” Unfortunately, a
corrupt Dutch official may have pocketed her followers’ money instead of
properly delivering it to the Wecqueasgeek for their land. In August or
September of 1643, an Indian raid killed Hutchinson and most members of
the families living with her. Sixteen people died in total.[^23]
