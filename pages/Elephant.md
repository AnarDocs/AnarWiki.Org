The following is from "The *Current Affairs* Field Guide to Socialist
Animals" by Lyta Gold and Nick Sirotich[^1]:

> Proudly *matriarchal*, elephants form organized herds of 8-100 (mostly
> female) individuals. They share *communal care labor*, and kick out
> males when they become sexually aggressive and *brocialist*. Their
> *matriarchal* character, gentleness, and *herbivorous diet* have led
> many male researchers to conclude that elephants are harmless.
> However, new research has revealed that elephants have a secret form
> of *sub-sonic communication*, producing deep rumbles at a frequency
> too low to be heard by the human ear. It is possible that the
> *revolution* is coming, and when it arrives it will be in the form of
> a sudden *stampede*.

The philosopher Harry Gensler's website claims that elephants follow the
Golden Rule. It cites a [video](https://youtu.be/f_gBWPs4r3U), in which
adults (after 3:00) help a juvenile elephant out of the mud.[^2]
