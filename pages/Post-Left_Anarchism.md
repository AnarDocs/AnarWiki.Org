Post-Left Anarchism refers to a broad tendency which critiques
traditional
"<a   href="Leftism.md" class="wikilink" title="Leftism">"Leftism</a> in its
relation to
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchism">"Anarchism</a> and
"<a   href="Hierarchy_Introduction.md" class="wikilink"
title="Hierarchy">"Hierarchy</a> in particular. Post-Left Anarchists tend
to critique the Left from an "<a   href="Anti-Politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Political">"Anti-Political</a> perspective, not to be
confused for an embrace of the political Right or Centre. The term
"Post-Left Anarchism" was coined, or at least popularized, by Bob Black
in his 1997 book *Anarchy After Leftism,* which critiqued Bookchin,
Libertarian Municipalism, Democracy, Organization, and
Anarcho-Syndicalism*,*[^1] though the term has evolved and shifted
since.

## Post-Left Critiques of Leftism

Post-Left Anarchists often critique the Left on its perceived dogmatic
attachment to concepts regarding, but not limited to:

- Organization
- "<a   href="Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Revolutionary">"Revolutionary</a> Idealism
- Collective Ideology
- Morality
- "<a   href="Workerism.md" class="wikilink" title="Workerism">"Workerism</a>
- and Rigid Ideological Conformity.[^2]

They often cite the arisal of soft-hierarchies within Leftist
organizations and social circles, criticizing the notion that
"<a   href="Direct_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="directly democratic">"directly democratic</a> and
"<a   href="Consensus_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus-based">"consensus-based</a> organizations are
Anarchistic in their structure. Post-Left Anarchism tends to reject the
ideas that "Anarchism means no rulers, not no rules" and that "Anarchism
is not against all hierarchies, it's against unjust hierarchies." The
critique often revolves around the idea that Anarchism **is against
all** imposed order and hierarchies, even those that seem to spring up
naturally e.g., the hierarchy of those with the most time to dedicate to
consensus meetings,[^3] and the power-imbalances that stem from hoarding
specialized knowledge in an industry or field.

There is also a current within Post-Left Anarchist thought which
criticizes revolutionary idealism, rejecting that one should wait for
revolutionary conditions to be met to achieve their autonomy. Instead
they embrace momentary acts of
"<a   href="Insurrectionary_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Insurrection">"Insurrection</a> in which individuals and their
"<a   href="Affinity_Group.md" class="wikilink"
title="affinity groups">"affinity groups</a> reclaim their autonomy in
the present.

## Influences on Post-Left Anarchist Thought

Although Post-Left Anarchism as a term was coined by Bob Black in 1997,
many Post-Left Anarchists derive influence from sources long before the
coinage of the term, as well as more contemporary sources. The tendency
often references influences from, but not limited to:

- "<a   href="Individualist_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Individualist Anarchism">"Individualist Anarchism</a>
- "<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner&#39;s">"Max
  Stirner's</a>
  "<a   href="Egoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Egoism">"Egoism</a>[^4]
- "<a   href="Renzo_Novatore.md" class="wikilink" title="Renzo Novatore">"Renzo
  Novatore</a>[^5]
- "<a   href="Anarchist_Nihilism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Nihilism">"Nihilism</a>
- "<a   href="Illegalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Illegalism">"Illegalism</a>
- Insurrectionary Anarchist currents
- "<a   href="Alfredo_M._Bonano.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Alfredo M. Bonano">"Alfredo M. Bonano</a>[^6]
- "<a   href="Anti-Work.md" class="wikilink" title="Anti-Work">"Anti-Work</a>
  thought[^7]
- as well as countless Zines, Poems, Songs, and other artforms by
  Anarchists who break from the traditional forms of theory writing.

By the nature of Post-Left Anarchism being such a broad description of a
general disillusionment with the political Left, and a perceived
paradoxical Anarchist Orthodoxy, many under the Post-Left umbrella often
have conflicting ideas. Post-Left Anarchists typically embrace this as
they would rather not be beholden to any one ideology or framework. Some
embrace joy and playfulness,[^8] some embrace nihilism and despair.[^9]
The connective tissue that makes the Post-Left Anarchism descriptor is
the disillusionment with dogmatic ties to Leftist/Anarchist orthodoxy.
