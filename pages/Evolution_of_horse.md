Murray Bookchin cites the evolution of the horse as an example of what
he calls *participatory evolution*, a process in which species and their
environments play an active role in collaboratively shaping the
evolutionary process. Bookchin writes:

> The modern horse did not evolve alone. It lived not only among its
> predators and prey but in creatively interactive relationships with a
> great variety of plants and animals. It evolved in ever-changing
> ecocommunities such that the “rise” of *Equos caballus* occurred
> conjointly with other herbivores that shared, maintained, and even
> played a major role in creating their grasslands. The string of bones
> that traces eohippus to Equus is really evidence of the succession of
> the ecocommunities in which the animal and its ancestor interacted
> with each other.[^1]

Peter Kropotkin, in
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">"Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution</a>, describes how horses live in societies and practice
mutual aid:

> Life in societies is again the rule with the large family of horses,
> which includes the wild horses and donkeys of Asia, the zebras, the
> mustangs, the cimarrones of the Pampas, and the half-wild horses of
> Mongolia and Siberia. They all live in numerous associations made up
> of many studs, each of which consists of a number of mares under the
> leadership of a male. These numberless inhabitants of the Old and the
> New World, badly organized on the whole for resisting both their
> numerous enemies and the adverse conditions of climate, would soon
> have disappeared from the surface of the earth were it not for their
> sociable spirit. When a beast of prey approaches them, several studs
> unite at once; they repulse the beast and sometimes chase it: and
> neither the wolf nor the bear, not even the lion, can capture a horse
> or even a zebra as long as they are not detached from the herd. When a
> drought is burning the grass in the prairies, they gather in herds of
> sometimes 10,000 individuals strong, and migrate. And when a
> snow-storm rages in the Steppes, each stud keeps close together, and
> repairs to a protected ravine. But if confidence disappears, or the
> group has been seized by panic, and disperses, the horses perish and
> the survivors are found after the storm half dying from fatigue. Union
> is their chief arm in the struggle for life, and man is their chief
> enemy. Before his increasing numbers the ancestors of our domestic
> horse (the Equus Przewalskii, so named by Polyakoff) have preferred to
> retire to the wildest and least accessible plateaus on the outskirts
> of Thibet, where they continue to live, surrounded by carnivores,
> under a climate as bad as that of the Arctic regions, but in a region
> inaccessible to man.
