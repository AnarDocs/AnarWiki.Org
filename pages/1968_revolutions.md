A wave of revolutionary activity swept the globe in a cluster of years
around 1968. The targets included, primarily, the hegemonic power of the
United States in the world system along with Soviet acquiescence, and,
secondarily, the stale and bureaucratic "Old Left."[^1] Moving beyond
overwhelming focus on the proletariat, the "New Left" added concerns of
feminism, gay liberation, ecology, national liberation, issues related
to the disabled, and more. Abandoning the Old Left's bureaucratic
political structures, the New Left often preferred to experiment with
horizontal structures, with ideas of "prefigurative politics,"
participatory democracy," and in some cases, anarchism.

Immanuel Wallerstein argues that the *world revolution of 1968*
transformed global political common sense. New cultural mores of
anti-racism, feminism, and sexual revolution entered the mainstream, and
a critique of US imperialism and the bureaucracy of the Old Left became
vastly more legitimate.[^2]

Some anarchists and libertarian Marxists argue that the workers',
feminist, black liberation, indigenous and other struggles of the 1960s
caused the breakdown in the 1970s of Keynesian policies and the
so-called golden age of capitalism. "As the revolt against exploitation
grew," John Holloway writes, "both in its monetised and non-monetised
forms, the extraction of surplus value became more and more difficult
for capital."[^3] According to this explanation, the struggles succeeded
in putting the entire world capitalist system into a major crisis.
Neoliberalism, then, was a counter-revolution, an attempt by the ruling
class to "recover after the revolution of 1968."[^4]

# Manifestations

## Tet Offensive

On 31 Jan 1968 (the third day of Tet, the Vietnamese New Year),
Vietnamese fighters of the National Liberation Front launched attacks
attacks within almost every major city and town in southern Vietnam. In
the two months of fighting from 29 Jan to 31 March, at least 3,895
occupying United States soldiers died. As poor Vietnamese peasants
caught the world's largest military by surprise, the attacks shocked the
American public. In March 1968, for the first time, more Americans
opposed the Vietnam War than supported it.[^5]

In the wake of the Tet Offensive, protests against the Vietnam War and
against American military hegemony accelerated globally.

## Columbia University occupation

1,000 people organized by the Student Afro-American Society, SDS, and
other groups occupied five buildings at Columbia University from 23
April to 30 April 1968. Police arrested more than 700 people.[^6]
Kirkpatrick Sale describes the occupation as a moment when many SDS
members realized that they had revolutionary aims.[^7] Along with
various Marxist groups, the anarchistic Yippies played a role in the
occupation.[^8]

Raymond Brown, who led the Student Afro-American Society, explains his
group's role, which historians of the occupation have neglected:

> But certainly, the black students played a pivotal role, because,
> first of all, we were more disciplined than any other group. We
> determined—we were the first to determine to barricade buildings. We
> asked, in a manner that’s become controversial in the ensuing years,
> the white students to leave and grab other buildings. And we
> barricaded that first building.
>
> Our role was strategically pivotal because city had just erupted weeks
> earlier after Dr. King’s death. There was a perception that Harlem
> might rise, and we did have a lot of community support. And so, the
> reason this lasted for seven days was because nobody wanted to arrest
> the black students, and, subsequently, that meant they couldn’t arrest
> white students. So, our role was pivotal, though ignored historically
> and journalistically.[^9]

title="The May-June Revolt in France, 1968">The May-June Revolt in
France, 1968</a>.*

In May and June of 1968, a wave of riots and occupations swept France
and nearly 10 million workers went on strike. The uprising enjoyed
strong popular support; on May 8, a poll by the French Institute of
Public Opinion found that four-fifths of the country sympathized with
students in Paris who had been rioting for several days.[^10] With the
influence of the Situationist International, radically
anti-authoritarian and utopian slogans appeared on walls across the
country. "Be realistic: demand the impossible." "Live without dead
time." "Boredom is counterrevolutionary." "Happiness is hanging your
landlord." "No forbidding allowed."[^11]

The economy was brought to a halt, and the conservative president
Charles de Gaulle even temporarily fled the country.[^12] However,
workers stopped short of actually reopening and self-managing the
factories they occupied, and in June the country re-elected de Gaulle.
*An Anarchist FAQ* offers the following explanation for why the revolt
failed in the short-term:

> So why did this revolt fail? Certainly not because "vanguard"
> Bolshevik parties were missing. It was infested with them.
> Fortunately, the traditional authoritarian left sects were isolated
> and outraged. Those involved in the revolt did not require a vanguard
> to tell them what to do, and the "workers' vanguards" frantically ran
> after the movement trying to catch up with it and control it.
>
> \[I\]t was the lack of independent, self-managed confederal
> organisations to co-ordinate struggle which resulted in occupations
> being isolated from each other. So divided, they fell. In addition,
> Murray Bookchin argues that *"an awareness among the workers that the
> factories had to be worked, not merely occupied or struck,"* was
> missing.[^13]

The Communist Party played a role in suppressing the revolution.
Crimethinc summarizes the conclusions of May 1968 participants Daniel
Cohn-Bendit and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit: "The Communist CGT union negotiated
a settlement with the government to get the workers back to work, and
when the workers they claimed to represent refused en masse, they
functioned as strikebreakers."[^14]

## Latin America

The most famous event in Latin America involved the Tlatelolco massacre
of about four hundred protesters in Mexico City on 2 October 1968. On 23
July 1968, riot police attacked two rival student groups in Mexico City.
The attacks united the student movement against police repression, and
three days later, thousands marched. The police attacked again, killing
seven, wounding five hundred, and arresting hundreds. On 29 July, over
150,000 students launched a general strike, closing all of Mexico City's
schools. At Polytech University by the end of August, the strike had
reached 300,000 participants, and a strike council issued demands
related to a variety of social issues. In September, a National Strike
Council formed and demanded public negotiations with the president. When
the president refused, a rally was called in Tlatelolco housing district
of Mexico City for 2 October. At the rally, police and soldiers
massacred about four hundred people. “Without warning, soldiers and
police viciously attacked the rally, shooting hundreds of people. In
many cases they followed the wounded into the hospitals and killed them
there. To this day, no one knows for sure how many people were killed at
Tlatelolco.”[^15]

This was not the region's only instance of radical activity or of brutal
state repression. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the police murder of a
student on 29 March 1968 led to two weeks of riots. In Uruguay, strikes
and riots led the state to declare martial law in July 1968. Rebellion
swept the country. In Argentina, the murder of three students in May
1968 sparked major protest and on 12 June, four hundred students
occupied the University of La Plata in Buenos Aires.[^16] In Córdoba,
Argentina, a 1969 uprising forced the ousting of Juan Carlos Onganía's
military dictatorship. Urban movements in Chile "modified the structure
of cities and brought Salvador Allende to the presidency in 1970."[^17]
Farmers' struggles in the mountains of Peru ousted Juan Velasco Alvaro's
government. Miners and other workers in Bolivia in 1970 built a powerful
Popular Assembly that challenged ruling class power.[^18]

## Pakistan

In October 1968, masses of Pakistani students revolted began against
government repression of students and dissidents. The Left parties did
not support the students. Riots broke out on 6 November in several
cities. The government ordered all schools closed. In December, students
called a general strike which workers from many industries joined.[^19]
