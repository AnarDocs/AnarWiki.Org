> Those readers who remember the days of CND and the Committee of 100
> may recall the episode of the Spies for Peace. A group of people
> unearthed details of the RSGs or Regional Seats of Government,
> underground hide-outs to ensure the survival of the ruling elite in
> the case of nuclear war, It was of course illegal to publish this
> information, yet all over the country it appeared in little anonymous
> duplicated pamphlets within a few days, providing an enor­mously
> interesting example of *ad hoc* federal activity through loose
> networks of active individuals, We later published in *Anarchy* some
> reflections on the implications of this:
>
> One lesson to be drawn from 'Spies for Peace' is the advantage of *ad
> hoc* organisation, coming rapidly into being and if necessary
> disappearing with the same speed, but leaving behind innumerable
> centres of activity, like ripples and eddies on a pond, after a stone
> has been thrown into it.
>
> Traditional politics (both 'revolutionary' and 'reformist') are based
> on a central dynamo, with a transmission belt leading outwards.
> Capture of the dynamo, or its conversion to other purposes, may break
> the trans­ mission entirely. 'Spies for Peace' seems to have operated
> on an entirely different basis. Messages were passed from mouth to
> mouth along the route, documents from hand to hand. One group passed a
> secret to a second, which then set about reprinting it. A caravan
> became the source of a leaflet, a shopping basket a distribution
> centre. A hundred copies of a pamphlet are distributed in the streets:
> some are sure to reach the people who will distribute them.
>
> Contacts are built on a face to face basis. One knows the personal
> limitations of one's comrades. X is an expert at steering a meeting
> through procedural shoals, but cannot work as a duplicator. Y can use
> a small printing press, but is unable to write a leaflet. Z can
> express himself in public , but cannot sell pamphlets. Every task
> elects its own workers, and there is no need for an elaborate show of
> hands. Seekers of personal power and glory get little thrill from the
> anonymously and skilfully illegal. The prospect of prison breeds out
> the leader complex. Every member of a group may be called upon to
> undertake key tasks. And all­-round talent is developed in all. The
> development of small groups for mutual aid could form a basis for an
> effective resistance movement.
>
> There are important conclusions. Revolution does not need conveyor
> belt organisation. It needs hundreds, thousands, and finally millions
> of people meeting in groups with informal contacts with each other. It
> needs mass consciousness. If one group takes an initiative that is
> valuable, others will take it up. The methods must be tailored to the
> society we live in. The FLN could use armed warfare, for it had hills
> and thickets to retreat into. We are faced by the overwhelming
> physical force of a State better organised and better armed than at
> any time in its history. We must react accordingly. The many internal
> contradictions of the State must be skilfully exploited. The
> Dusseldorf authorities were caught in their own regulations when the
> disarmers refused to fasten their safety belts. MIS cannot conceive of
> subversion that is not master­ minded by a sinister Communist agent. It
> is incapable of dealing with a movement where nobody takes orders from
> anyone else. Through action, autonomy and revolutionary initiative
> will be developed still further. To cope with our activities the
> apparatus of repression will become even more centralised and even
> more bureaucratic. This will enhance our opportunities rather than
> lessen them.[^1]
