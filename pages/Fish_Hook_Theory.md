# Fish Hook Theory

## Overview

**Fish hook theory** is a political concept that challenges the
conventional linear understanding of the
<a href="Political_Spectrum.md" class="wikilink"
title="political spectrum">political spectrum</a> and the related
<a href="Horseshoe_Theory.md" class="wikilink"
title="horseshoe theory">horseshoe theory</a>. The theory proposes that
<a href="Centrism.md" class="wikilink" title="centrist">centrist</a> and
<a href="Far-Right_Politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="far-right">far-right</a> ideologies are closer to each other than
either is to the <a href="Far-Left_Politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="far-left">far-left</a>, visualized through the curved shape of a
fish hook where the barbed end points toward the center.

From an anarchist perspective, fish hook theory resonates strongly with
historical observations of how liberal and centrist forces have
repeatedly enabled, collaborated with, or transformed into far-right
movements when faced with revolutionary threats from the left. The
theory articulates what many anarchists have long observed: that the
apparent "moderation" of centrism often serves as a gateway to
authoritarian right-wing politics rather than a bulwark against it.

## Origins

Fish hook theory emerged in online political discourse during the 2010s
as a direct critique of horseshoe theory.[^1] Horseshoe theory,
popularized by centrist commentators, claims that the far-left and
far-right resemble each other more than they resemble the political
center. Leftist critics developed fish hook theory to challenge this
framing, arguing instead that centrist politics systematically enable
far-right movements rather than oppose them.

The theory gained traction particularly among leftists frustrated with
the false equivalence drawn between revolutionary left movements seeking
liberation and far-right movements seeking domination. While horseshoe
theory was often deployed to discredit radical left organizing by
associating it with fascism, fish hook theory emerged to expose the
material reality of how centrist institutions and ideologies have
historically facilitated fascist ascension to power.

## Analysis

### The Fish Hook Model

The theory visualizes the political spectrum as a fish hook rather than
a straight line or horseshoe. The far-left occupies the eye of the hook,
representing its fundamental opposition to both centrist and right-wing
politics. The political center lies along the shank of the hook, while
the far-right sits at the barbed point. This configuration places the
center in closer proximity to the far-right than to the far-left,
suggesting structural affinity between centrism and right-wing
extremism.

### Mechanisms of Centrist Enablement

Academic analysis has identified several mechanisms through which
centrism facilitates far-right politics. Anthony Ince's 2023
peer-reviewed study in the journal *Space and Polity* examined how
centrism provides institutional platforms that allow far-right ideas to
resonate within liberal state structures.[^2]

Centrist emphasis on free speech absolutism and rational debate often
provides far-right perspectives with legitimate public platforms. The
centrist commitment to protecting property rights and existing power
structures creates openings for far-right movements that promise to
defend those same structures against perceived left-wing threats.
Centrist parties frequently form coalitions with right-wing forces while
excluding the left, normalizing far-right participation in governance.

### Historical Examples

The <a href="Weimar_Republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a> serves as a prominent
historical example of fish hook theory in practice. Centrist parties
repeatedly accommodated and collaborated with far-right forces while
violently suppressing left-wing movements. The
<a href="Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany_(SPD).md" class="wikilink"
title="Social Democratic Party">Social Democratic Party</a> utilized the
proto-fascist
<a href="Freikorps.md" class="wikilink" title="Freikorps">Freikorps</a> to
crush the <a href="Spartacist_Uprising.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spartacist uprising">Spartacist uprising</a> and murdered
revolutionary leaders like
<a href="Rosa_Luxemburg.md" class="wikilink" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa
Luxemburg</a> and
<a href="Karl_Liebknecht.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Liebknecht">Karl
Liebknecht</a>. This pattern of centrists allying with the far-right
against the revolutionary left paved the way for
<a href="Nazi_Germany.md" class="wikilink" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> seizure of
power.

More recent examples include centrist parties in Europe normalizing
far-right rhetoric on immigration and security while maintaining harsh
opposition to left-wing economic policies. Neoliberal economic policies
championed by centrist parties have created conditions of precarity and
inequality that far-right movements exploit, while centrist resistance
to left-wing solutions leaves the far-right as the only apparent
alternative to the status quo.

## Anarchist Perspective

### Structural Critique

Anarchists find fish hook theory compelling because it reflects
fundamental structural realities about
<a href="Capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
states and liberal democracy. Both centrism and far-right politics
ultimately serve to maintain <a href="Hierarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> power structures and property
relations, differing primarily in rhetoric and methods rather than
fundamental goals. When revolutionary movements threaten these
structures, centrists historically side with the far-right over the
emancipatory left.

The theory aligns with anarchist analysis of the state itself as
inherently authoritarian. Centrist liberalism and far-right fascism both
rely on
<a href="The_State.md" class="wikilink" title="state power">state power</a>
to enforce their visions of social order, while anarchism fundamentally
opposes state authority. From this perspective, the apparent proximity
between centrism and the far-right reflects their shared commitment to
hierarchical organization, merely disagreeing on the optimal level of
overt violence required to maintain it.

### The Ratchet Effect

Fish hook theory connects closely with the
<a href="Ratchet_Effect.md" class="wikilink" title="ratchet effect">ratchet
effect</a> in political economy. The ratchet effect describes how
policies and institutions tend to move in one direction while resisting
reversal, like a mechanical ratchet that allows movement forward but
prevents backward motion.[^3]

In the context of fish hook theory, centrist normalization of right-wing
positions creates a ratchet effect where the political "center"
continuously shifts rightward. Policies once considered far-right become
centrist positions, while previously centrist positions become
characterized as far-left. Meanwhile, actual left-wing positions remain
marginalized or excluded entirely from acceptable discourse. This
creates a one-way mechanism: centrism drifts toward the far-right, but
never toward the far-left, because the structural foundations of both
centrism and far-right politics depend on maintaining capitalist
property relations and state power.

Anarchists observe this ratchet effect operating across multiple
domains. <a href="Surveillance.md" class="wikilink"
title="Surveillance">Surveillance</a> powers granted during emergencies
become permanent.
<a href="Borders.md" class="wikilink" title="Border">Border</a> controls
intensify but never liberalize. Police forces expand but rarely
contract. <a href="Neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Neoliberal">Neoliberal</a> privatization proceeds relentlessly
while <a href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a> are
never restored. Each rightward shift becomes locked in, resistant to
reversal even when centrists claim to oppose the consequences.

### Liberal Fascism

The phrase "scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds," attributed to the
<a href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>, captures the
anarchist understanding of fish hook theory.[^4] This proverb reflects
the observation that liberal commitments to freedom and democracy remain
conditional, quickly abandoned when property relations or state
authority face revolutionary challenge.

When confronted with movements for genuine liberation—whether anarchist,
communist, or anti-colonial—liberal states historically embrace fascist
methods. The
<a href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a> supported fascist dictatorships throughout Latin America
while claiming to defend democracy. European colonial powers used
genocidal violence to maintain their empires while celebrating
Enlightenment values at home. Contemporary liberal democracies employ
mass surveillance, militarized policing, and indefinite detention while
maintaining democratic aesthetics.

## Criticism

### Academic Reception

Fish hook theory has received limited attention in mainstream academic
political science literature, partly due to its origins in online
discourse rather than formal academic development.[^5] Some critics
argue the theory shares analytical weaknesses with horseshoe theory
itself, oversimplifying complex political relationships and reducing
multidimensional political ideologies to single-axis representations.

Research on public political literacy suggests limitations to any
left-right framework. A 2019 YouGov poll found that approximately half
of British survey respondents could not identify typical left-wing or
right-wing policies, and nearly 50 percent described themselves as
neither left-wing nor right-wing.[^6] This suggests that spatial
metaphors for politics may not correspond to how most people actually
understand political positions.

### Anarchist Considerations

While many anarchists find fish hook theory useful for describing
centrist collaboration with the far-right, some anarchist theorists
caution against over-reliance on any single-axis model of politics.
<a href="Three-Way_Fight.md" class="wikilink"
title="Three-way fight theory">Three-way fight theory</a>, developed
within anti-fascist organizing, proposes that contemporary politics
involves three distinct forces: the establishment (including both
centrist and traditional conservative elements), revolutionary left
movements, and far-right movements. This framework emphasizes that all
three forces conflict with each other, rather than suggesting any two
are necessarily aligned.

Some anarchists also note that fish hook theory, like horseshoe theory,
risks implying that the far-left and center-right are somehow equivalent
in their distance from the "center," when anarchists reject the entire
premise of centrist moderation as legitimate. The theory may
inadvertently reinforce the legitimacy of centrism by treating it as a
meaningful political position rather than an ideological defense of
existing hierarchies.

## Contemporary Relevance

Fish hook theory continues to resonate in contemporary political
discourse as centrist parties across the globe adopt increasingly
right-wing positions on immigration, policing, surveillance, and
economic policy while maintaining harsh opposition to left-wing
alternatives. The rise of far-right movements in the United States,
Europe, and elsewhere has frequently occurred through normalization by
centrist media and political institutions, validating the theory's core
claims.

For anarchists organizing against both state authority and far-right
movements, fish hook theory serves as a reminder that centrist
liberalism cannot be relied upon as an ally against fascism. Historical
and contemporary evidence demonstrates that when faced with
revolutionary challenge, centrist forces typically collaborate with the
far-right to preserve capitalist property relations and state power,
making autonomous anti-fascist organizing essential rather than
optional.
