# Anti-Tankie

The core arguments against tankies are that they betray working-class
struggle by subordinating workers' self-organization to the interests of
authoritarian states claiming socialist legitimacy—most starkly
illustrated when they defended Soviet tanks crushing the Hungarian
workers' councils in 1956. Their "anti-imperialism" seems false, merely
supporting Russian or Chinese imperialism rather than genuinely opposing
all forms of imperial domination, reducing complex geopolitics to a
simplistic "oppose whatever the US supports" framework.

Tankies often engage in genocide denial and historical revisionism,
dismissing well-documented Soviet atrocities as "Western propaganda"
while silencing the voices of those who actually experienced Soviet
repression. Rather than focusing on grassroots issues like workers'
rights, housing, and climate change, tankies fixate on defending
authoritarian state actions in major geopolitical conflicts. Ultimately,
tankie ideology reproduces the same imperial logic it claims to oppose,
and that genuine anti-imperialism requires supporting working-class
movements against all states—capitalist, fascist, or nominally
socialist—rather than cheering for one set of oppressive regimes against
another.
