During the U.S. Civil War, the Confederate General Albert Pike warned
that black suffrage would create “a hell on earth, a hideous, horrid
pandemonium filled with all the devils of vice, crime, pauperism,
corruption, violence, political debauchery, social anarchy.”[^1] Pike
was correct in one sense, although not in the way he intended; the
extension of liberty to African Americans did foster an atmosphere of
“social anarchy.” From strikes and mutual aid societies, to squatting
empty plots and seizing land from former masters; from the assertion of
community control over churches and education, to the enactment of
economic and political reforms even more radical than those of the Paris
Commune; the movement of post-Civil War Reconstruction represented a
brief period of sweeping bourgeois democratization.

Black participation in the region's state governments and capitalist
economy was secured, against the former slave-owning aristocracy, by the
ongoing presence of Northern troops largely at the behest of Radical
Republicans such as Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens. Max Shachtman's
book *Race and Revolution* speaks to how Reconstruction faced
limitations due to its dependence on Northern bourgeois elements:

> "The bourgeois democratic revolution, the smashing of the feudal
> system of slavery, had been accomplished in alliance with the radical
> wing of the Republican bourgeoisie of the North. This alliance was
> short-lived. The transformation of the Negro slave into a free and
> independent peasant, such as emerged from the bourgeois democratic
> revolution of France, was not completed. Nor could it be or will it be
> completed by any class or section of the bourgeoisie, not even the
> most radical. The Sumner-Stevens group was the most extreme democratic
> wing the American bourgeoisie could produce. It rose to its greatest
> heights during the Reconstruction period. Since that time the
> bourgeoisie as a whole has moved steadily to a more reactionary
> position."[^2]

Still, Reconstruction disrupted one of history's most hierarchical
societies—that of the Southern U.S. slavery—and began replacing it with
a society that white racists found deeply threatening to the foundations
of white supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy. Reconstruction could
be viewed as a social revolution with an anti-authoritarian wing that
was thwarted by a counter-revolution and a lack of solidarity from
leftists in the U.S. North.

South Carolinian Thomas Miller later described the achievements of
Reconstruction: "We were eight years in power. We had built
schoolhouses, established charitable institutions, built and maintained
the penitentiary system, provided for the education of the deaf and
dumb, rebuilt the jails and courthouses, rebuilt the bridge and
reestablished the ferries."[^3]

The Anarchist political scientist Joel Olson insisted:

> "The ignorance of Black freedom movements is so profound that even
> anachistic tendencies within them get ignored...The Black-led
> Reconstruction government in South Carolina from 1868-1874, which Du
> Bois dubbed the 'South Carolina Commune,' did far more toward building
> socialism than the Paris Commune in 1871 ever did."[^4]

# Background

## Civil War

A turning point in the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) over slavery was,
according to the sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, a "general strike" of
enslaved people who ran away from their masters in the South and joined
the Northern (anti-slavery) side in the war. This strike "decided the
war" in the North's favor" according to Du Bois.[^5] In total, some half
a million slaves fled their masters.[^6]

The historian Thavolia Glymph notes that while Du Bois focused on the
role of Black men in this general strike, women were major participants
too. Enslaved women, such as one named Rose took up arms against the
Southern Confederacy. She was executed by her enemies.[^7] The women who
supported the Northern Union army did not always get favorable treatment
from the Union soldiers. For example, an enslaved cook who welcomed
invading Union forces found herself unrewarded for feeding the soldiers
her mistress’s finest meats and foods for three weeks. When the mistress
asked a Union guard for protection from the subversive slave, the guard
shot the cook dead. “In the end, a member of the army of deliverance in
which the slave woman had placed her faith had committed to protecting a
woman whose husband was in the enemy’s army.”[^8]

"For the duration of the Civil War," writes Kevin van Meter, "slaves
launched insurrections, sabotaged farm implements, set storehouses
ablaze, and fled to join the Union Army. Escaped slaves based in maroon
communities waged guerilla warfare."[^9]

## Reconstruction Act

After the war, the 1867 Reconstruction Act divided the country's South
into five military districts. For the following twelve years, blacks
secured the right to vote and took high positions in political office
across the South. The most extensive reconstruction occurred in South
Carolina, where blacks captured control of the state legislature. Due to
a rise in white supremacist terrorism and the withdrawal of federal
troops, Reconstruction collapsed in 1877, leading to the rise of Jim
Crow. Blacks continued to use some of the same Reconstruction-era direct
action tactics in subsequent struggles for freedom.

# Radical anti-capitalist visions

Black demands for liberty struck against the heart of American
capitalism. By 1820, cotton had become “the dominant driver of US
economic growth,” explains Edward Baptist in *The Half Has Never Been
Told*. In the next two decades, cotton jumped from 14 percent to 42
percent of total US exports. The rise in cotton production occurred
mainly as the result of the “pushing system” under slavery;
slave-drivers would continually push slaves harder and harder until they
picked precisely as much cotton as they could. A slave who did not meet
their quota was whipped. A slave who picked above their quota was given
a new quota. Productivity per slave increased by almost 400 percent from
1819 to 1860. At the dawn of the Civil War, slavery remained central to
the growth of the US economy.[^10] Defenders of slavery insisted slavery
was so important to the economy that nonviolent tactics could not
possibly abolish the institution: James Hammond, a supporter of slavery,
said in 1845:

> But if your course was wholly different—If you distilled nectar from
> your lips and discoursed sweetest music...do you imagine you could
> prevail on us to give up a thousand millions of dollars in the value
> of our slaves and a thousand millions of dollars more in the
> depreciation of our lands...[^11]

The capitalists' extraordinary measures to re-impose slave-like
conditions on freed African Americans after the Civil War show the
importance of white supremacy to capitalism. In one scheme, the convict
lease system, states leased prisoners to work in the mines, railroads,
and timber industry. The prisoners were often treated worse than slaves,
since the temporary employers had no incentive to keep the workers alive
and healthy for the long term. Many prisoners in the convict lease
system “died of abuse and disease.”[^12]

Many African Americans in the Reconstruction era wanted more than
nominal emancipation; they wanted to enjoy freedom at its fullest, and
this yearning led them to develop radical, anti-capitalist visions.
According to Du Bois, South Carolina's black residents consciously
desired “to rid themselves of the dominion of private capital.”[^13]
Although Du Bois says that black South Carolinians wanted to themselves
own capital, he meant by this merely household ownership of land. By and
large, according to Tera Hunter, African Americans' goal was
self-sufficiency.[^14] Although they did not seem to oppose the market,
the radical economic vision was consistent with individualist and
mutualist varieties of anarchism.[^15] At South Carolina's
constitutional convention, the black delegate R.C. Delarge called for
the government to buy land and distribute it to landless black
families.[^16] According to Tera Hunter, freedom to Reconstruction-era
blacks “meant the reestablishment of lost family connections, the
achievement of liberty, the exercise of political rights, and the
security of a decent livelihood without the sacrifice of human dignity
or self-determination.”[^17] In the context of a capitalist system
trying to reimpose slavery-like conditions, these could be interpreted
as revolutionary demands to restructure the economy: for the
expropriation and redistribution of property, and for a system capable
of offering dignity and autonomy to the country's most oppressed class
of workers.

In South Carolina, black residents came closest to building the society
they envisioned. Their government implemented reforms much more radical
than those of the explicitly revolutionary Paris Commune. Comparing
South Carolina to the Paris Commune, Noel Ignatiev discusses the “South
Carolina Commune,” and Joel Olson attributes the term to W.E.B. Du
Bois.[^18] While some in Paris talked about building a public education
system, Reconstruction South Carolina actually created such a system.
Reconstruction South Carolina provided health care assistance, built
institutions for the deaf and insane, and distributed land to over
14,000 black families. A century ahead of its time, the South Carolina
government took the radical step of banning racial discrimination in
public places, although this law was not often enforced.[^19] Outside of
South Carolina, Reconstruction achieved significant though less radical
reforms, including health care programs and eliminating corporal
punishment for many crimes. Before Reconstruction, public education did
not exist in the South except for a poorly-funded system in North
Carolina. By the end of Reconstruction, southern governments had built
100 schools, including 16 colleges, with over 12,000 students.[^20]

These reforms, however groundbreaking, did not encompass the full vision
of Reconstruction. Ongoing struggles for justice indicated that the
governments' reforms represented a moderate compromise of the
grassroots' vision, including in South Carolina. In 1865, hundreds of
blacks in South Carolina refused to pay taxes to the state
government.[^21] In 1876, farm workers in Colleton County, South
Carolina went on strike and threatened to destroy planters' crops. In
the state's Buford County, 200 black rice farmers went on strike, locked
scabs in outhouses, “overpowered a sheriff and his posse”.[^22] Hine,
Hine and Harold discuss how radical black leaders were held back by both
white politicians and moderate black politicians. Black leaders, they
write, “often disagreed among themselves about issues and programs.
Class and prewar status frequently divided them. Those leaders who had
not been slaves and had not been raised in rural isolation were less
likely to be concerned with land and agricultural labor.”[^23]

The radical black Reconstruction vision included community control. For
the first time, Southern blacks controlled their own churches and
schools. Before the Civil War, whites ran all Southern churches, and
enslaved and free blacks had to sit in the back rows. When the black
population was large enough, a church with an all-black congregation
would be established, but the pastor was always white. By contrast,
Reconstruction-era blacks formed their own churches, and by the end of
Reconstruction the vast majority of blacks had left white-controlled
churches.[^24] Blacks asserted control over the school system and made
their communities' education explicitly liberatory. In Georgia, for
example, African Americans successfully lobbied to change the name of
the education department to the Georgia Equal Rights and Educational
Association.[^25] Records from a school in Kentucky show teachers
encouraging students to think for themselves and explore radical social
ideas:

> TEACHER: Now children, you don't think white people are any better
> than you because they have straight hair and white faces?
>
> STUDENTS: No, sir.
>
> TEACHER: No, they are no better, but they are different, they possess
> great power, they formed this great government, they control this vast
> country...Now what makes them different from you?
>
> STUDENTS: Money! TEACHER: Yes, but what enabled them to obtain it? How
> did they get money?
>
> STUDENTS: Got it off us, stole it of we all![^26]

# Direct action movement

So far, it has been argued that Reconstruction challenged the white
supremacist foundations of American society, had an anti-capitalist
vision, and achieved significant reforms that moved society toward that
vision. For such reasons, Du Bois considered Reconstruction a
“revolution comparable to the upheavals in France in the past, and in
Russia, Spain, India, and China today.”[^27]

However, Du Bois overemphasizes the role of government. The election of
black politicians, while significant, was a mere piece of
Reconstruction, which was predominantly a direct action movement. Alfred
Grey, a black, property-less legislator and militia member in Alabama's
Tallapoosa County called for an armed uprising on 3 February 1868, the
eve of elections:

> \[Am\] I afraid to fight the white man for my rights? No! I may go to
> hell, my home is hell, but the white man shall go there with me...And
> every one come in and bring your guns and stand up for your rights!
> Let them talk of social equality, mixed schools, and a war of races.
> We'll fight until we die, and go together, or we'll carry this
> constitution.[^28]

As Noel Ignatiev remarks, such a speech by a landless legislator
signifies “that we are no longer talking about a bourgeois
parliament.”[^29]

Nowhere did blacks fully control the state governments. Even in South
Carolina, where blacks achieved the greatest degree of state power,
“most of the administrative power was in the hands of whites”.[^30]
Whites dominated Southern police forces, and police could often be found
among the ranks of the Klu Klux Klan. Police led white mobs in four days
of violence and burning houses, churches, and schools in Memphis, 1866.
Forty-six blacks and two whites died. In a study of the
Reconstruction-era South, Melinda Hennessey found that police led
one-third of the South's riots, and in only three cases did the police
try to stop the riots.[^31] For African Americans, self defense provided
better protection than the police did. The Klan “was rarely active where
black people were in a majority and prepared to defend themselves. In
the case of white supremacy, the Klan usually attacked those who could
not defend themselves.”[^32]

The government never carried out General William Tecumseh Sherman's
Field Order Number 15, which promised to expropriate 400,000 acres and
distribute 40-acre parcels to black families. Unable to rely on the
government, blacks themselves seized land. In some cases, they
expropriated land from their former masters' estates, although they
usually did not get to keep this land very long. In other cases, they
occupied unused or abandoned land. Elsewhere, blacks pooled money
together and collectively bought farms.[^33]

Reconstruction-era African Americans created thousands of mutual aid
groups, such as burial societies, debating clubs, drama societies, and
trade associations.[^34] The establishment of these groups constituted a
form of direct action; in each case communities decided to directly and
collectively improve their own lives. In Atlanta, blacks pooled together
funds and built a hospital.[^35] Eric Foner writes that these groups
offered blacks “social fellowship, sickness and funeral benefits, and,
most of all, a chance to manage their own affairs.”[^36] Often, mutual
aid did not require formal organization; people simply helped out their
friends and family. Writing from Milton, Florida in 1867, Dave Waldrop
offered to take care of his cousin Sarah and her children. “Dear cousin,
I received word last week that you wer not doing very well in Montgomery
and that times wer very hard there,” the letter began.[^37]

In the urban South, black women wage workers quit demeaning jobs, stole
table scraps, stole breaks, feigned illnesses, went on strike, and
formed cooperative networks encompassing “neighborhoods, families,
churches, mutual aid organizations, dance halls, and vaudeville
theaters.”[^38] In Atlanta, female workers quit jobs that paid too
little or had too many hours. Quitting, the historian Tera Hunter
observes, “was an effective strategy to deprive employers of complete
power over their labor.”[^39] In other cases, strikes were larger and
more coordinated. In Jackson in 1866, black female laundry workers went
on strike, demanding a higher wage. The outcome of the strike is
unknown. The same year, in Galveston, black women went on strike against
unfair pay and confinement to household work. It is unclear how many
strikers achieved their demands by the time the strike faded out.[^40]

# Contradictions and Lessons

Of the many contradictions and limitations of Reconstruction, a main one
involved a clash between the movement's transformative vision and its
reliance on protection from a very conservative federal government. In
the end, the government betrayed southern blacks. President Andrew
Johnson “vetoed bills to help Negroes; he made it easy for Confederate
states to come back into the Union without guaranteeing equal rights to
blacks.”[^41] With the Compromise of 1877, the US withdrew troops from
the South, and Reconstruction collapsed.

A second contradiction was that Reconstruction's vision of liberation
sometimes stopped short of liberating women. According to Eric Foner,
“black preachers, editors, and politicians emphasized women's
responsibility for making the home 'a place of peace and comfort' for
men and urged them to submit to their husband's authority...The records
of the Freedmen's Bureau contain hundreds of complaints by black women
of beatings, infidelity, and lack of child support.”[^42] A third
contradiction involved the criminal justice system. While Reconstruction
governments relaxed punishments for many crimes, they also built new
prisons even as the institution put many blacks back into slave-like
conditions in the convict lease system.

These limitations, it may be argued, should not have precluded
revolutionary solidarity from anarchists and other leftists. The culture
of Reconstruction had patriarchal aspects, but the movement also had
powerful women leaders, including South Carolina's Rollins sisters who
worked with Republican politicians while advocating women's
suffrage.[^43] Reconstruction relied on military assistance from the
federal government, but government involvement has not stopped
anarchists from supporting various movements. Anarchists today support
the anti-authoritarian Kurdish groups of Rojava (western Kurdistan)
despite the fact that these groups have received military assistance
from the United States. Ecological anarchists tend to support acts by
the federal government to enforce environmental regulations. An
insistence on purity could make one easily miss the revolutionary
promise of not just Reconstruction but any movement.

There is no one reason why Reconstruction collapsed, but a lack of
solidarity from Northern leftists was a factor. “Apparently, American
Internationalists were able to look across the ocean to the Paris
Commune, but could not cast their eyes southward to the South Carolina
Commune,” writes Noel Ignatiev.[^44] This lack of solidarity is a
recurring theme in anarchist and leftist politics: the failure of urban
Mexican anarchists to unite with Zapatista peasants in the 1910 Mexican
Revolution, the failure of Spanish anarchists to unite with Moroccans in
the 1936 Spanish Revolution, the Israeli kibbutzim's alignment with
Zionist colonizers over Palestinian resisters are a few examples.
Perhaps things are changing today with Anarchists joining Black Lives
Matter protesters, themselves often horizontally-organized,
decentralized and radically critical of the existing society.
