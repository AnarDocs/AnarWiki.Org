The **Minoan Crete Civilization**
("<a   href="Timeline_of_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="3000BCE - 1100BCE">3000BCE - 1100BCE</a>) was a large, peaceful,
and possibly matriarchal Bronze Age Mediterranean society that
flourished from about 3000 BCE to 1100 BCE. It was an
"<a   href="List_of_Anarchist_Societies.md" class="wikilink"
title="egalitarian civilization">egalitarian civilization</a> that
flourished on Crete and surrounding Aegean islands in the Mediterranean
Sea. It had around 90 different cities and a population reaching into
the millions until it was destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption.[^1]
Due to the predominance of feminine icons, a number of scholars have
argued that Minoan Crete had a "matriarchal" society, which may have
been egalitarian and consensus-based.

Some mainstream scholars have been cautious about such
characterizations, noting a paucity of evidence.[^2] In a similar vein,
Social Ecologist theorist Janet Biehl has sharply rejected the
interpretation of Minoan Crete as a utopia or matriarchy:

> Minoan Crete was a Bronze Age civilization, and it would defy
> archaeological credibility to assume that such a highly developed
> civilization could have been anything but hierarchical, exploitative,
> and oppressive.[^3]

However, the archeologist Marija Gimbutas found in Minoan Crete a
continuation of "Old Europe's" earlier Neolithic culture of largely
egalitarian matricentrism, as evidenced by Crete's economic
decentralization, matrilocal marriage, and feminine-centered religious
imagery. Noting an inequality in tomb sizes, she hypothesized that there
was "a degree of social ranking."[^4] More recently, David Graeber and
David Wengrow have argued that Minoan Crete was probably a "a system of
female political rule - effectively a theocracy of some sort, governed
by a college of priestesses."[^5] Graeber rejects the mainstream
scholarly reticence to accept the existence of matriarchy in Crete.
Responding to complaints about an absence of ethnographic data, he notes
that scholars have been able to understand the Athenian polis without
ethnographic materials. Scholars say female-oriented religion and art do
not, by themselves, imply gender equality or matriarchy in actual social
relations. However, Graeber points out, "\[N\]o one has ever managed to
produce an example of a patriarchal society in which artistic
representations focus nearly exclusively on images of powerful women,
mystical or otherwise, either."[^6]

Going further, archaeomythologist Joan Cichon argues that Minoan Crete
was an egalitarian form of matriarchy, with a decentralized gift-based
economy and consensus-based governance facilitated by a council of women
elders.[^7] Similarly, theologian and Crete tour guide Carol Christ
described Crete as "a society without dominance" and with "genuine
equality between the sexes."[^8] Likewise, Peter Gelderloos contends
that the Cretans had a stateless and classless society.[^9]

According to Gimbutas, Minoan culture "declined after the middle of the
2nd millennium B.C., not from internal strife, but as a result of
natural catastroph\[e\] in combination with the gradual incursion onto
the island of patriarchal, Indo-European-speaking Mycenaeans."[^10]

# Culture

## Matriarchy

Arguing that Minoan Crete was a matriarchal theocracy, Graeber and
Wengrow point out that there are Minoan depictions of female authorities
but not of male authorities. Unlike the women, who are always dressed,
most portrayals of men are of naked or nearly naked athletes or show the
men acting subserviently before women.[^11] As further evidence, they
note that Cretan traders, who were usually men, tended to overwhelmingly
bring back sacred objects honoring female goddesses such as Hathor.[^12]
Although they argue that Minoan Crete is a rare case in the historical
record of actual female rule, they point out that matriarchy is more
common in human history if matriarchy can be understood more broadly.
They define matriarchy as a society that models governance on the
mother's role in the household much as patriarchy bases governance on
the father's domineering role.[^13]

The philosopher Heide Goettner-Abendroth also considers Crete to be a
matriarchal society, but she defines matriarchy as having "true
gender-egalitarian relations" while symbolically centering female power.
Pointing out that "arche" can mean "beginning" rather than "domination,"
she argues that matriarchy shows women to be givers of life in the
context of "gender-egalitarian society."[^14]

In contrast to Graeber and Wengrow's claims about women's rule in Crete,
Carol Christ argues that there was equality between the sexes:

> While the Goddess is at the center and women are the primary actors in
> many of the rituals depicted on seal rings and other artifacts, men
> are never portrayed as servile or subordinate. It appears that both
> men and women took delight in their bodies and came together without
> the specters of fear and self-loathing, dominance and contempt that
> have marred the relations between the sexes throughout recorded
> history."[^15]

Peter Gelderloos interprets the art of Minoan Crete as inclusive of
transgender priestesses: "\[The Cretans\] were, if not matriarchal,
non-patriarchal, with almost exclusively female deities and female or
trans priestesses."[^16]

Deities depicted in Minoan art are almost exclusively female,

title="gender non-conforming">gender non-conforming</a> or
"<a   href="transgender.md" class="wikilink"
title="transgender">transgender</a> figures. This suggests a society
that was aware of the existence of
"<a   href="Queer_People.md" class="wikilink" title="queer people">queer
people</a> and practiced "<a   href="Gender_Equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="gender equality">gender equality</a>.[^17]

## Religion

<figcaption>Museu_arqueologic_de_Creta24.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>

Minoan religious imagery emphasized regeneration and often portrayed
goddessess surrounded by plants and animals such as lionesses, birds,
and snakes. The snake, which sheds its skin, may have been a symbol of
regeneration and connected to a springtime ritual of floral
regeneration.[^18]

Carol Christ refers to the snake-holding female figures as snake
Goddesses and says they "call to mind a time when women were not afraid,
when our power to bring life forth from the darkness was recognized as
sacred."[^19]

Religious shrines were maintained on mountains and in caves.[^20]

## Marriage

> divorce at her pleasure. Also, the mother's brother occupied an
> important position and was responsible for bringing up her
> children.[^21]

## Play

Minoan art focuses on "scenes of play and attention to creature
comforts," according to Graeber and Wengrow. They later add, "There are
no heroes in Minoan art - only players. Crete of the palaces was the
realm of *Homo ludens*. Or perhaps, better said, *Femina ludens* - not
to mention *Femina potens*."[^22] While noting Minoan depictions of
playful women dancing and bull-leaping for sport, John Younger reports
that "Minoan women are rarely depicted at work."[^23]

Unlike modern-day bull-fighting, the Minoan bull-leaping sport did not
hurt or kill the animal.[^24]

# Decisions

Cichon argues that Crete made decisions through "councils of consensus
facilitated by women elders of the society."[^25] Her evidence includes:

> "decentralized record keeping and administration; the lack of spatial
> separation between monumental buildings and ordinary ones; the lack of
> fortifications in general; the evidence of benches at Ayia Triadha and
> Knossos; the communal as well as sacred nature of the temple-palaces;
> the new understanding of the Minoan villas as the centers of
> settlements where manufacturing, administration, and ceremony took
> place, rather than as the dwelling places of the aristocracy; and the
> archaeological as well as mythological and iconographical evidence for
> matrilineality and matrilocality[^26]

Although Crete had large buildings sometimes referred to in the
scholarly literature as "palaces," these buildings actually served,
according to Peter Gelderloos, "as warehouses, redistribution centers,
collective housing for priestesses and administrators, archives, and
religious sites."[^27] Gelderloos writes that the Cretans were "in all
probability a stateless people."[^28]

One such building had a room that had been identified as a "throne
room," with a chair and stone benches ensuring everyone can see each
other, and with an adjacent bathing chamber. Originally considered the
site of a monarch, it has since been likened to a similar room in
Akrotiri which portrays a female initiation ceremony probably connected
to menstruation.[^29] Graeber and Wengrow interpret the purported throne
room as "not the seat of a male monarch but rather that of a council
head and its occupants more likely a succession of female
councilors."[^30]

Crete had a written language, but the decoded documents in that language
do not mention laws, rulers, or other elements of statecraft. In almost
all states, one of the primary functions of written language was to
document laws and to chronicle the lives and careers of elites. By
contrast, the writings from Crete seem to focus mostly on trade and a
little on religion.[^31] The abundance of communal buildings, similar
sized houses and absence of evidence for centralized power suggest a
possible use of "<a   href="Democratic_Assembly.md" class="wikilink"
title="assemblies">assemblies</a> for decision-making.

# Economy

Internally, Crete had an predominantly gift-based economy, and they
traded with people overseas. Farming was hoe-based rather than
plough-based.[^32]

The archaeologists Driessen, Jusseret, and Letesson have noted a
"remarkable absence or scarcity of traditional indicators of land
ownership . . . field boundaries, rock art, agricultural terraces or
clear natural borders coinciding with differences in material
culture."[^33] This finding suggests an absence of private land
ownership.

Some archaeological evidence suggests that craftsmen and priestesses
enjoyed more luxury goods than farmers and herders did. Moreover,
Younger notes that at least one piece of Minoan art portrays different
class stratification:

> "The Grandstand fresco shows a crowd of women with their heads
> depicted in a band of white paint. A second class of women stands at
> the top of stairs dressed in a simple robe (heanos). A third class of
> women sits or kneels on the top of the stairs or on platforms. These
> last women are depicted twice as large as the other women in the
> fresco, and they are dressed in 'court' costume."[^34]

Still, there is evidence that Minoan Crete may have been a relatively
egalitarian or even classless society. As Cichon notes, even the
mainstream archeologist Robert Koehl "acknowledges that Crete appears to
be a relatively egalitarian society where, even in Late Minoan days, LM
I, 1580-1450 BCE, 'wealth was still widely distributed.'"[^35]

Cichon argues that Minoan Crete had an egalitarian, balanced, gift-based
economy:

> "I have proposed that the new studies investigating the archaeological
> evidence for clan dwellings; the new understanding of the Minoan
> villas as centers of regional manufacturing, administration, and
> ceremony; recent orks detailing the temple-palaces as communal
> buildings connected to their surrounding towns and countryside by
> ceremonial routes; the lack of archaeological evidence for private
> property, especially of privately held land; the archaeological
> evidence for feasting, drinking, and toasting; the provisions of the
> Law Code of Gortyn regarding the economic role of women; current
> archaeological literature investigating the nature of Minoan social
> systems, especially matrilocality and matrilinearity; the legends, as
> detailed by Witcombe, that reveal the matrilocal/matrilineal roots of
> Minoan Crete; and the iconography, particularly the frescoes that show
> women managing eating and drinking ceremonies, all plausibly support
> the hypothesis that Minoan Crete had a balanced economy in which women
> distributed goods and practiced economic mutuality and
> gift-giving."[^36]

Gelderloos also does not think that there was class stratification. He
argues that the farmers and herders enjoyed too diverse a diet and too
high a standard of health to have been a toiling, exploited class. He
also notes that there is no evidence of police force that could impose
work:

> On the one hand, the Cretan diet was too rich, too diversified to
> suggest a hyper-exploited, enslaved lower class. Put simply, enslaved
> workers do not have the resources for a healthy diet, and they lack
> the time to dedicate to multiple forms of subsistence. Nor is there
> evidence of a Cretan army or other mechanisms capable of imposing the
> sort of work-or-starve, blackmail economy so common in other
> city-states. The very diversity of Cretan food production (spanning
> multicrop agriculture, apiculture, silvaculture, aquaculture, fishing,
> and hunting, a diversity that would be impossible for a weak state to
> surveil and control), paired with the lack of evidence of a police or
> military structure makes the proposal of a coerced or dependent
> peasant population ludicrous. In the worst case, merchant-priests
> controlling the palaces might have been able to impose an unfavorable
> exchange rate making it difficult or impossible for the peasants to
> acquire luxury goods, but the peasants would still have been more or
> less self-sufficient, autonomous, and healthy."[^37]

Gelderloos further speculates:

> "In practice, the palace economy was probably a network of religious
> centers where farmers, artisans, and merchants brought their produce
> or their trade goods, sometimes in the spirit of a gift, an offering
> to the gods that would be redistributed, and sometimes in the spirit
> of exchange. Mask-wearing priestesses represented the gods in
> important ceremonies, anonymizing spiritual power rather than
> concentrating it in any individual or family."[^38]

The Minoan economy was grounded heavily in trade, although there may
have been some degree of "<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership and use">common ownership and use</a>,
suggesting
"<a   href="Mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualist">mutualist</a>
practices.[^39]

# Environment

Religious imagery celebrated animals and plants as sacred. Minoans
protected certain mountains and caves as shrines.[^40]

# Crime

There is no evidence that Crete had police.[^41]

# Foreign Policy

Crete was "a peaceful society with a minimum of defensive infrastructure
and no record of involvement in offensive warfare."[^42]

Although some Minoan cities had defensive walls built around them, there
is no evidence that Minoan Civilization engaged in war with other
societies. There is limited evidence of fighting occurring between
citizens, but this was likely for sports and festivals.[^43]
