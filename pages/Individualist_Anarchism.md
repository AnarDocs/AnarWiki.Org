# Individualist Anarchism

**Individualist anarchism** or **anarcho-individualism** is a collection
of <a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
currents that emphasize the
<a href="individual.md" class="wikilink" title="individual">individual</a>
and their will over external determinants such as groups, society,
traditions, and ideological systems.

Individualist anarchism can be divided into two main distinct movements,
each with its own ideological orientations. On one hand, there is
American individualist anarchism, which began with Warren in the 1860s.
It focuses primarily on economic freedom, drawing upon Stirner's egoist
anarchism and Proudhon's mutualism, developing perspectives that are
notably financial in nature. Most American individualist anarchists of
the 19th century advocated mutualism, a libertarian socialist form of
market socialism. American individualist anarchists opposed property
that violates the entitlement theory of justice and is exploitative,
seeking to "destroy the tyranny of capital" through mutual credit.[^1]

On the other hand, European individualist anarchism emerged between 1885
and 1895 in the labour movement. Much less studied and not directly
connected to American individualist anarchism, with virtually no
influence by Proudhon or Stirner initially, it generally consisted of
militants with very different outlooks—particularly marked by strong
radicalism, general adherence to anarchist communism, and often highly
radical positions, including significant support for revolutionary
violence and propaganda of the deed. The European movement was also
distinguished by its strong opposition to the emerging
anarcho-syndicalism of the same period, its rejection of the distinction
between bourgeoisie and proletariat—seen as social constructs of
capitalism to be abolished—and its close affinity with the social
outlook of women, sex workers and criminals. This helps explain its
rapid association with the rise of anarcha-feminism and illegalism in
Europe.

Although usually contrasted with social anarchism, both individualist
and social anarchism have influenced each other. Among the early
influences on American individualist anarchism were

included Pierre Martinet, Vittorio Pini, Clément Duval, Errico
Malatesta, Émile Henry, Zo d'Axa, and groups such as the Intransigeants
of London and Paris.

Within anarchism, American individualist anarchism is primarily a
literary phenomenon while social anarchism has been the dominant form of
anarchism, emerging in the late 19th century as a distinction from
individualist anarchism after anarcho-communism replaced collectivist
anarchism as the dominant tendency.

## General Overview

### Distinction Between American and European Currents

American and European individualist anarchism are distinct movements
that can be considered independently from one another. This is largely
due to the fact that the ideological perspectives within these currents
are highly fragmented and that both movements didn't influence each
other in their first decades. For example, while Stirner's egoist
anarchism and Proudhon's mutualism are major influences on the American
individualist anarchist movement, they have little to no impact on the
European movement initially.

Stirner, for instance, was only belatedly received in France by
individualist anarchists, who found his ideas unoriginal and
articulating concepts they believed they had already developed more
effectively themselves. American individualist anarchism is usually far
more studied and known than its European counterpart.

### Core Principles of American Individualist Anarchism

The term individualist anarchism is often used as a classificatory term
but in very different ways. Some use the classification individualist
anarchism versus social anarchism, while others contrast individualist
anarchism with collectivist anarchism or anarcho-leftism.

Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism.
The first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates
self-government with progressive rationalism that included benevolence
to others. The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of
egoism as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is found in
Herbert Spencer's early predictions and in some of his disciples,
foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the course of social
evolution. The fourth type retains a moderated form of egoism and
accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market
relationships.

Individualist anarchism of different kinds have the following things in
common:

- The concentration on the individual and their will in preference to
  any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion,
  metaphysics, ideas or the will of others

<!-- -->

- The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing
  it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies.
  Instead, they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about
  anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education
  which could be brought about today

<!-- -->

- Individual experience and exploration is emphasized. The view that
  relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own
  interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as
  desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually
  rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists

Tucker's two socialisms were the state socialism which he associated to
the Marxist school and the libertarian socialism that he advocated. What
those two schools of socialism had in common was the labor theory of
value and the ends, by which anarchism pursued different means.[^2]

The egoist form of individualist anarchism, derived from the philosophy
of Max Stirner, supports the individual doing exactly what he
pleases—taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.[^3]

Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw associations of egoists
drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness. Another
important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes
individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions.
Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted "amongst artists,
intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general".

Anarchist historian George Woodcock wrote of individualist anarchism's
tendency to distrust co-operation beyond the bare necessities for an
ascetic life.

### European Individualist Anarchism

In Europe, the tendency emerged later, during the 1880s and 1890s.
Although it emerged later chronologically, this tendency generally did
not exhibit causal links with previous American individualist anarchism,
at least during its initial period. Before being theorized, the first
European individualists, particularly in France, were often militants
involved in illegalism or insurrectionarism.

Within these circles, French individualist anarchism gradually took
shape. In general, anarchists of this tendency shared several
intellectual positions:

- **Anti-capitalism, anarchist communism and need for immediate
  Revolution**: French individualist anarchists were economically
  committed to anarchist communism and believed that a revolution was
  necessary. They sometimes held romanticized views of revolution,
  inspired by the Paris Commune and the French Revolution. This led them
  to adopt a generally radical stance and support violent methods to
  advance the revolution. As such, they were strong advocates of
  propaganda by the deed or illegalism as revolutionary strategies

<!-- -->

- **Anti-syndicalism**: A strong opposition to syndicalism and
  anarcho-syndicalism was found among these militants. Unions were
  perceived as structures of domination and as potential social-traitors
  due to their alleged reformist stances and collaboration with power.
  As a result, these militants were strongly opposed to the majority of
  the European anarchist movement at the time, which was gradually
  moving toward anarcho-syndicalism

<!-- -->

- **Critique of economic frameworks and attention to other struggles**:
  These anarchists also distinguished themselves by challenging the
  exclusively economic interpretations of domination. Thus, communism,
  although shared, was not placed at the center of French individualist
  thought. They advocated for the abolition of the proletariat after the
  revolution, considering it—like the bourgeoisie—to be a social
  construct of capitalism. The central role given to the worker in
  anarcho-syndicalism also became a strong point of criticism for
  individualist anarchists of this tendency, who generally focused more
  on women, the unemployed, sex workers, or criminals, showing
  particular interest in the struggles of the so-called
  lumpenproletariat

This last point is illustrated for example by the soup conferences held
in Paris by Pierre Martinet or Séverine in the winters of the early
1890s. The European individualist anarchism later on met the American
one, such as in the thought of Émile Armand, who started including
Stirner in his thought in the interwar period.

European individualist anarchists are described by historian Céline
Beaudet as "dissenters among dissenters, 'anarchy within anarchism',
rarely considered for their own sake, either relegated to the closets of
History or described through the lens of their detractors: bourgeois or
police informants for 'orthodox' anarchists, bandits or criminals for
the bourgeois, 'dispersion of tendencies' or 'irresponsible' revolt
among historians".[^4]

## Origins and Early Precursors

### William Godwin

William Godwin can be considered an individualist anarchist. Godwin
advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor
be eliminated. Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all
individuals are not of equal value, with some "of more worth and
importance" than others depending on our utility in bringing about
social good. Therefore, he did not believe in equal rights, but that the
person's life should be favored that is most conducive to the general
good.[^5]

Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right
to "private judgement" to determine which actions most maximize utility,
but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's
judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism,
was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.

Godwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals
performing together in orchestras, writing in Political Justice that
"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an
evil". He believed democracy to be preferable to other forms of
government.

Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with
any of the ideologies that claim his influence. Some consider Godwin
both an individualist and a communist, while others regard him as the
founder of communist anarchism, and some view him as an individualist
anarchist without reservation.

### Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first philosopher to label himself an
"anarchist". Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist
while others regard him to be a social anarchist. Some commentators do
not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his
preference for association in large industries rather than individual
control.

### Max Stirner and Egoism

Johann Kaspar Schmidt, better known as Max Stirner, was a German
philosopher who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism,
existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of
individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is **The Ego and Its Own**,
also known as **The Ego and His Own**. This work was first published in
1844 in Leipzig and has since appeared in numerous editions and
translations.

Max Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called egoism, is a form of
individualist anarchism. Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose "name
appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of
anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of
individualist anarchism". In 1844, Stirner's work The Ego and Its Own
was published and is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition
of individualist anarchism".

Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the
state, but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with
one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive
to one's interests. Stirner says that the egoist rejects pursuit of
devotion to "a great idea, a good cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty
calling", arguing that the egoist has no political calling, but rather
"lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may
fare thereby".

Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is
that individual's power to obtain what he desires. Stirner proposes that
most commonly accepted social institutions, including the notion of
state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very
notion of "society" as a legal and ideal abstractness, were mere spooks
in the mind. Stirner wants to "abolish not only the state but also
society as an institution responsible for its members".

Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Union of egoists,
non-systematic associations which he proposed as a form of organization
in place of the state. A Union is understood as a relation between
egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an
act of will. Even murder is permissible "if it is right for me",
although it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster
genuine and spontaneous unions between individuals.

Stirner's concept of "egoistic property" includes not only a lack of
moral restraint on how one obtains and uses things, but includes other
people as well. His embrace of egotism is in stark contrast to Godwin's
altruism. Although Stirner was opposed to communism, for the same
reasons he opposed capitalism, humanism, liberalism, property rights and
nationalism, seeing them as forms of authority over the individual and
as spooks in the mind, he has influenced many anarcho-communists and
post-left anarchists.

This position on property is quite different from the native American,
natural law, form of individualist anarchism which defends the
inviolability of the private property that has been earned through
labor. Other egoists include James L. Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora
Marsden and John Beverly Robinson. In Russia, individualist anarchism
inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich
Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and
intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi as well as a few lone wolves who found
self-expression in crime and violence. They rejected organizing,
believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and
domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism.
This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcha-feminist Emma
Goldman.

### Early Individualist Anarchism in the United States

The intentional communal experiments pioneered by Josiah Warren
influenced European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early
20th centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities they
founded.

The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on
the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty. Some
individualist anarchists such as Thoreau do not speak of economics, but
simply of the right of "disunion" from the state and foresee the gradual
elimination of the state through social evolution.

## American Individualist Anarchism

### Mutualism and Utopianism

Proudhonian Anarchism was found in the United States at least as early
as 1848 and it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist
Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. William B. Greene
presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic
form.

William Batchelder Greene is best known for the works **Mutual Banking**
(1850) which proposed an interest-free banking system and
**Transcendentalism**, a critique of the New England philosophical
school. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order". His
"associationism is checked by individualism". Over matters which are
purely personal, such as moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as
well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands
'mutuality' in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal
freedom and property.

Within some individualist anarchist circles, mutualism came to mean
non-communist anarchism.

### Boston Anarchists

Another form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States
as advocated by the so-called Boston anarchists. By default, American
individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that "one man
employ another" or that "he direct him", in his labor but rather
demanded that "all natural opportunities requisite to the production of
wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising
from special privileges created by law be abolished".

They believed state monopoly capitalism (defined as a state-sponsored
monopoly) prevented labor from being fully rewarded.

Lysander Spooner besides his individualist anarchist activism was also
an important anti-slavery activist and became a member of the First
International.

Some Boston anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves
as socialists, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of
a commitment to improving conditions of the working class. The Boston
anarchists such as Tucker and his followers continue to be considered
socialists due to their opposition to usury. They do so because there
are many different kinds of competitive markets such as market socialism
and capitalism is only one type of a market economy.[^6]

By around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist
anarchism had passed.

## European Individualist Anarchism

### France

From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition
of French individualist anarchism. An early important individualist
anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French
Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of **Anarchie, Journal de
l'Ordre** and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850.
During his travels in the United States "he at least contacted (Henry
David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren".

Later, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as Albert
Libertad, André Lorulot, Émile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and
Rirette Maîtrejean, who in 1905 developed theory in the main
individualist anarchist journal in France, **L'Anarchie**.

In this sense, "the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of
\[F\]rench individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even
within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong
defence of birth control methods, the idea of unions of egoists with the
sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in
practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and
action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection
within others".

Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions,
recognizing only the reality of "might" rather than "right"; and for the
most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires,
not for some greater ideal. Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's egoism
as well as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (his view that "property is theft!"),
Clément Duval and Marius Jacob proposed the theory of **la reprise
individuelle** (individual reclamation) which justified robbery on the
rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system.

### Germany

In Germany, the Scottish-German John Henry Mackay became the most
important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. He fused
Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually
translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own,
**Die Anarchisten** and **Der Freiheitsucher**, contributed to
individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a
consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these
works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American
circles led by Tucker.

Stirnerist individualism was popular among literary and intellectual
anarchists in pre-WWI Germany, for instance influencing the
expressionist movement and the early thought of Otto Gross.

### Italy

In Italy, individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards
illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French
individualist anarchism, but perhaps more extreme and which emphasized
criticism of organization be it anarchist or of other type.

### Russia

Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of anarchism in
Russia, along with the more prominent anarcho-communism and
anarcho-syndicalism. The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists
were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class.

The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in
Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (born Pavel
Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for
a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois
society—political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced
by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of
individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human
personality from the fetters of organized society.

Some Russian individualist anarchists "found the ultimate expression of
their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached
themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the
majority remained 'philosophical' anarchists who conducted animated
parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in
ponderous journals and books".

Lev Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois
Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of
anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the
individual.

### Spain

While Spain was influenced by American individualist anarchism, it was
more closely related to the French currents. Around the start of the
20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts
of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel
Giménez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde who translated French
and American individualists. Important in this respect were also
magazines such as **La Idea Libre**, **La Revista Blanca**, **Etica**,
**Iniciales**, **Al margen**, **Estudios** and **Nosotros**. The most
influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner.

Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had
importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and
Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press.
Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in
motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.

Catalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist
anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups
and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were
also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico
Urales and Miguel Giménez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J.
Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian
Anarchist Federation.

Between October 1937 and February 1938, Spanish individualist anarchist
Miguel Giménez Igualada was editor of the individualist anarchist
magazine **Nosotros** in which many works of Armand and Ryner appeared.
In his youth, he engaged in illegalist activities. His thought was
deeply influenced by Max Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer
in Spain through his own writings. He published and wrote the preface to
the fourth edition in Spanish of **The Ego and Its Own** from 1900.

Federico Urales was an important individualist anarchist who edited **La
Revista Blanca**. The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced
by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a
defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of
influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for
promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an
individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality
and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he
viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy; and he thought that it
tended towards reformism. Instead, he favored small groups based on
ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the
establishment of the IAF in 1927.

In 2000, several anarchist ateneos republished Émile Armand's writings
on free love and individualist anarchism in a compilation titled
**Individualist anarchism and Amorous camaraderie**.

### Latin America

Argentine anarchist historian Ángel Cappelletti reports that in
Argentina "among the workers that came from Europe in the first two
decades of the century, there were curiously some stirnerian
individualists influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, that saw
syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established
affinity groups that in 1912 came to, according to Max Nettlau, to the
number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in Colón, the periodical **El
Único**, that defined itself as 'Publicación individualista'".[^7]

## Developments and Expansion

### Anarcha-Feminism, Free Love and LGBT Issues

In Europe, interest in free love developed in French and Spanish
individualist anarchist circles. "Anti-clericalism, just as in the rest
of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which
will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French)
Republic begins to have conflicts with the church. Anti-clerical
discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André
Lorulot, will have its impacts in **Estudios**. There will be an attack
on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the
past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a
counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a
criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on
both believers and agnostics".

This tendency continued in French individualist anarchism in the work
and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish
individualist anarchist magazine **Ética** and **Iniciales**, "there is
a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a
certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also
work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion,
faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's
theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".

### Anarcho-Naturism

Individualist anarchist groups also were affiliated with naturism and
individualist anarchist Henri Zisly promoted naturism in France. From
the 1880s, anarcho-individualist publications and teachings promoted the
social emancipatory function of naturism and denounced deforestation,
mechanization, civilization, and urbanization as corrupting effects of
the consolidating industrial-capitalist order.

## Criticism

Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to
democracy and its embrace of "lifestylism" at the expense of
anti-capitalism and class struggle.

George Bernard Shaw initially had flirtations with individualist
anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was "the negation of
socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical
conclusion as any sane man dare carry it". Shaw's argument was that even
if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of laissez-faire
advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming
unequal because it would permit private appropriation and
accumulation.[^8]

According to Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept
that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they
"do not see that as an injustice".[^9] Nonetheless, Peter Marshall
states that "the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist
anarchists" such as Tucker and Lysander Spooner have been overlooked.

Collectivist and social anarchists dispute the individualist anarchist
claim that free competition and markets would yield the
libertarian-egalitarian anarchist society that individualist anarchists
share with them. In their views, "state intervention merely props up a
system of class exploitation and gives capitalism a human face".

Many anarchists argue that individualist anarchists did not advocate
free competition and markets as normative claims and merely thought
those were better means than the ones proposed by anarcho-communists for
the development of an anarchist society. Individualist anarchists such
as Tucker thought interests, profits, rents and usury would disappear,
something that both anarcho-capitalists and social anarchists did not
think was true or believe would not happen. In a free market, people
would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and
exploitation or usury was taking place if they were not.

The theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be
available and that this would allow proliferation of new businesses
which would in turn raise demand for labor. This led Tucker to believe
that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of
labor would receive equal pay. Later in his life, Tucker grew skeptical
that free competition could remove concentrated capital.

### The Question of Anarcho-Capitalism

While anarcho-capitalism is sometimes described as a form of
individualist anarchism, many anarchist scholars have strongly contested
this characterization. Most anarchists argue that anarchism has
historically been an anti-capitalist movement and that
anarcho-capitalism is incompatible with anarchist principles.

Without the labor theory of value, some argue that 19th-century
individualist anarchists approximate the modern movement of
anarcho-capitalism, although this has been widely contested or rejected
by anarchist scholars. As economic theory changed, the popularity of the
labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective
theory of value of neoclassical economics.

There is a strong current within anarchism including anarchist activists
and scholars which rejects that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a
part of the anarchist movement. As Albert Meltzer wrote, "The philosophy
of 'anarcho-capitalism' dreamed up by the 'libertarian' New Right, has
nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement
proper".[^10]

Many anarchists emphasize that anarcho-capitalism is by no means a type
of anarchism and that anarchist opposition to so-called capitalist
'anarchists' does not reflect some kind of debate within anarchism, but
a debate between anarchism and its old enemy capitalism. Anarchists
argue that anarchism is not just opposition to the state, but opposition
to all forms of hierarchy and domination, including capitalism.

Individualist anarchism may plausibly be regarded as a form of both
socialism and anarchism. Many anarchists argue that individualist
anarchism is largely socialistic and can be considered a form of
individualist socialism. The very idea of an individualist-socialist
divide is contested by those who argue that non-Lockean individualism
encompasses socialism.
