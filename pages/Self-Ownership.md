# Self-Ownership

## Overview

**Self-ownership**, also known as **sovereignty of the individual** or
**individual sovereignty**, is the concept that individuals have
property rights in their own person - that one "owns" oneself in the
same way one might own an object. This concept is central to
"<a   href="right-libertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-libertarian">right-libertarian</a> and
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalist">anarcho-capitalist</a> philosophy, where it
is used to justify "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> and
"<a   href="wage_labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">wage labor</a>.

However, anarchists largely reject self-ownership as a fundamentally
flawed concept that reduces human beings to commodities, obscures
exploitation, and individuates what are inherently collective social
relationships. From an anarchist perspective, we do not "own"
ourselves - **we ARE ourselves**. The very premise of humans as
property, even self-owned property, abstracts us from our own existence
and imposes market logic onto human life itself.

## Origins

The concept of self-ownership originated with
"<a   href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>'s
*Second Treatise of Government* (1689), where he argued that "every man
has a Property in his own Person". This theory emerged specifically
during the rise of early capitalism and the
"<a   href="enclosure_of_the_commons.md" class="wikilink"
title="enclosure of the commons">enclosure of the commons</a>, serving
to justify the transformation of peasants into wage laborers and the
privatization of previously common lands.

In the 19th century, individualist anarchist
"<a   href="Josiah_Warren.md" class="wikilink" title="Josiah Warren">Josiah
Warren</a> was among the first to write about the "sovereignty of the
individual", though his usage differed from later right-libertarian
interpretations. "<a   href="Stephen_Pearl_Andrews.md" class="wikilink"
title="Stephen Pearl Andrews">Stephen Pearl Andrews</a>, an American
"<a   href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a>, also discussed
individual sovereignty extensively, considering it "the basis of
harmonious intercourse amongst equals" but within a socialist framework.

The modern popularization of self-ownership came primarily through
"<a   href="Murray_Rothbard.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> and
"<a   href="Ayn_Rand.md" class="wikilink" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> in the
mid-20th century United States. Rothbard deliberately appropriated the
term "libertarian" from its original anarchist and socialist usage to
describe his "<a   href="propertarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="propertarian">propertarian</a> philosophy, with self-ownership
becoming the foundational principle of so-called "anarcho"-capitalism.

## Right-Libertarian Theory

In right-libertarian philosophy, self-ownership extends beyond the body
to encompass control over one's labor and its products. As philosopher
"<a   href="G.A._Cohen.md" class="wikilink" title="G.A. Cohen">G.A. Cohen</a>
summarized: "the libertarian principle of self-ownership says that each
person enjoys, over herself and her powers, full and exclusive rights of
control and use, and therefore owes no service or product to anyone else
that she has not contracted to supply".

This framework is used to justify several conclusions:

- That individuals can sell their labor power in a "free market"
- That the products of one's labor belong exclusively to oneself
- That "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
  title="private property">private property</a> in external resources is
  legitimate when "mixed" with one's labor
- That "<a   href="taxation.md" class="wikilink" title="taxation">taxation</a>
  and "<a   href="redistribution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="redistribution">redistribution</a> violate self-ownership
  rights
- That any "voluntary" contract is legitimate, potentially including
  selling oneself into slavery

Proponents like "<a   href="Ludwig_von_Mises.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ludwig von Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a> argued that labor markets
represent the rational conclusion of self-ownership, claiming that
collective ownership ignores differing values for individual labor.
"<a   href="Robert_Nozick.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Nozick">Robert
Nozick</a> interpreted Locke as establishing that individuals have "a
right to decide what would become of himself and what he would do, and
as having a right to reap the benefits of what he did".

## Anarchist Critique

Anarchists reject self-ownership on multiple philosophical, ethical, and
practical grounds. Rather than empowering individuals, anarchists argue
that self-ownership theory serves to justify exploitation, obscure power
relations, and naturalize
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

### Objectification of Humans

The fundamental anarchist objection is that treating humans as
property - even self-owned property - reduces conscious beings to
commodities. We cannot be property because our consciousness,
relationships, and humanity are not things to be owned or traded. Human
dignity exists outside property relations entirely.

The fact that self-ownership theory logically leads to justifying
"voluntary" slavery exposes its inherent contradiction. If one truly
owns something, one can sell it. But selling oneself into slavery
violates the very autonomy that self-ownership supposedly protects,
revealing the concept's circular reasoning and ultimate incoherence.

### False Premise and Historical Function

Self-ownership did not emerge as a universal recognition of human
rights, but as an ideological justification for primitive accumulation
and "<a   href="wage_slavery.md" class="wikilink" title="wage slavery">wage
slavery</a>. Pre-capitalist societies operated through systems of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
commons, and collective responsibility - they could not even conceive of
humans or land as "property" in the modern sense.

The timing of self-ownership's emergence alongside early capitalism is
not coincidental. The theory was necessary to legitimate the
transformation of formerly independent peasants into wage laborers who
must sell their labor to survive. It naturalized the violence of
enclosure by reframing dispossession as a system of voluntary exchange
between self-owning individuals.

### Ignores Social Nature of Humanity

Everything that makes us human - language, culture, knowledge,
technology - is inherently social and collective. Even the most basic
human capabilities require years of social care and education. The
"self-made individual" is a myth that ignores how all human development
depends on collective social labor and shared knowledge built up over
generations.

Self-ownership theory presents humans as isolated property-owners when
we are fundamentally social beings. Our very capacity to conceptualize
self-ownership depends on collective social development. This radical
individualism contradicts the observable reality of human
interdependence.

### Internal Contradiction

Self-ownership contains a fatal philosophical contradiction: if you own
yourself, who exactly is the "self" that owns, and who is the "self"
that is owned? Are you the owner or the owned? Both? This creates an
impossible infinite regression.

Human agency and freedom are not based on ownership relations but are
fundamental aspects of human existence that are either nurtured or
suppressed by social conditions. Genuine autonomy cannot be derived from
property logic without falling into incoherence.

### Legitimizes Exploitation

By framing all exchanges as "voluntary" transactions between
self-owners, the theory obscures structural coercion. When someone must
"choose" between
"<a   href="wage_slavery.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">wage
labor</a> and starvation, this is not free choice but economic coercion
masked as voluntary exchange.

Real freedom requires having genuine alternatives. Under
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
most people must sell their labor to survive - this is not freedom but
structural violence. Self-ownership theory serves to legitimate this
exploitation by presenting it as a natural result of free individuals
exercising their property rights.

### Obscures Power Relations

The theory presents
"<a   href="wage_labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">wage labor</a>
as a contract between equals, ignoring fundamental power imbalances.
When one party owns the "<a   href="means_of_production.md" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">means of production</a> and the other must
work to survive, there is no equality. A worker "voluntarily" accepting
employment from the only employer in town, while having no savings and
children to feed, is not engaging in free exchange.

As "<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> observed: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves
instead of block slaves". Self-ownership theory masks this reality by
focusing on formal legal equality while ignoring material inequality.

### Naturalizes Inequality

By attributing social outcomes to individual choices of self-owners, the
theory naturalizes systemic inequality. Birth lottery largely determines
access to education, healthcare, connections, and opportunities.
Presenting these structural inequalities as natural results of
individual choices ignores history and structures of oppression.

Someone born into poverty with poor education faces vastly different
"choices" than someone who inherits wealth and connections.
Self-ownership theory treats these different starting points as
irrelevant, focusing only on formal ownership rights while ignoring
material conditions that constrain real freedom.

### Replicates Property Logic

Genuine freedom requires moving beyond property relations entirely.
Human dignity and liberty are not based on ownership but on our inherent
worth as conscious beings. We need to imagine forms of freedom and
social organization that don't reduce everything to property and market
relations.

As "<a   href="Oscar_Wilde.md" class="wikilink" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar
Wilde</a> argued: "The recognition of private property has really harmed
Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he
possesses... The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but
in what man is".

### Ignores Care Relations

Self-ownership theory cannot account for the vast realm of care work -
raising children, caring for elderly or disabled people, emotional
support - that makes society function. These essential activities cannot
be reduced to commodity exchange. They require different principles
based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="solidarity">solidarity</a>.

The theory also struggles to explain the status of children, the
elderly, and disabled people. Are infants self-owners? If not, when and
how do they acquire this status? The framework breaks down when
confronted with human dependency and care.

### Anti-Ecological

Self-ownership's radical individualism cannot address collective
environmental problems. Ecological crises demonstrate our fundamental
interconnectedness - we need collective democratic control over our
relationship with nature, not individual property rights that encourage
exploitation and destruction.

If everyone is a sovereign self-owner, what prevents one person's
"self-owned" actions from destroying the environment needed by others to
survive? The theory has no coherent answer beyond hoping that voluntary
exchange will somehow resolve collective action problems.

### Differential Human Value

If human value is determined by what qualities we can sell, some humans
inevitably become worth more than others. This violates the anarchist
principle of human equality. A society that treats some humans as worth
more than others based on their market value is fundamentally
oppressive.

Human worth and dignity are inherent, not based on productive capacity
or marketable skills. We need philosophy based on human flourishing and
equal dignity, not on ownership and market valuation.

## Anarchist Alternative

Anarchists propose understanding human freedom and dignity without
reference to ownership:

- **We ARE ourselves** - not property that owns itself, but conscious
  beings with inherent worth
- **Freedom is social** - genuine autonomy requires collective provision
  of basic needs and resources for human development
- **Interdependence is fundamental** - human development is inherently
  collective, not individualistic
- **Equality is essential** - all people have equal dignity regardless
  of productive capacity
- **Commons over property** - resources should be held in common and
  managed democratically rather than privately owned
- **Solidarity over exchange** - human relationships based on
  "<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
  rather than market transactions

This framework recognizes that freedom requires material conditions for
its exercise. Abstract rights without material means are meaningless.
True autonomy can only exist when people have their basic needs met and
access to the resources needed for human flourishing.

## Criticism

Some left-libertarians like
"<a   href="Hillel_Steiner.md" class="wikilink" title="Hillel Steiner">Hillel
Steiner</a> and "<a   href="Peter_Vallentyne.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Vallentyne">Peter Vallentyne</a> attempt to reconcile
self-ownership with egalitarianism by arguing that natural resources
should be equally shared. However, anarchists argue this still accepts
the flawed premise of humans as property and maintains market logic for
human labor.

The concept has also been critiqued from Marxist perspectives, with
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
analyzing how wage labor represents a form of slavery despite its formal
"voluntariness". The comparison between wage labor and slavery focuses
on the lack of genuine alternatives and the structural necessity for
workers to sell their labor power to survive.
