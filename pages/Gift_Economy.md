# Gift Economy

A **gift economy** or **gift culture** is a system of exchange where
valuables are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement
for immediate or future rewards.[^1] It is the principal economic theory
of <a href="Anarcho-Communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>. Social norms and
customs govern giving a gift in a gift culture; although there is some
expectation of reciprocity, gifts are not given in an explicit exchange
of goods or services for money, or some other good or service.[^2] This
contrasts with a
<a href="market_economy" class="wikilink" title="market economy">market
economy</a> or
<a href="bartering" class="wikilink" title="bartering">bartering</a>,
where goods and services are primarily explicitly exchanged for value
received.

The nature of gift economies is the subject of a foundational debate in
anthropology. Anthropological research into gift economies began with
Bronisław Malinowski's description of the Kula ring[^3] in the Trobriand
Islands during World War I.[^4] The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like
since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to
give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a
return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss
quickly established the complexity of "gift exchange" and introduced a
series of technical terms such as reciprocity, inalienable possessions,
and presentation to distinguish between the different forms of
exchange.[^5][^6]

According to anthropologists Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry, it is the
unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that
attracts the most attention. Some authors argue that gift economies
build community,[^7] while markets harm community relationships.[^8]
Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by
principles such as the form of property rights governing the articles
exchanged, whether gifting forms a distinct "sphere of exchange" that
can be characterized as an "economic system", and the character of the
social relationship that the gift exchange establishes.

## Implementation and Organisation

Similar but not identical to a
<a href="Horizontal_Economic_Planning" class="wikilink"
title="horizontally planned economy">horizontally planned economy</a>,
it involves the production of goods by
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed workplaces">self-managed workplaces</a> in a
<a href="free_federation" class="wikilink" title="free federation">free
federation</a>. In one possible implementation of the gift economy,
workplaces may hold councils or
<a href="Democratic_Assembly" class="wikilink"
title="assemblies">assemblies</a> with local communities and/or
<a href="Delegate" class="wikilink" title="delegates">delegates</a> to
determine how much of a demand there is for certain products. Typically
in a gift economy, goods would not be distributed to individuals, but
available for any individual in need to take for themselves.

Gift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular
objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to
society, from culture to culture. They are not universal. The nature of
gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.[^9]
Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade
or capital goods, ensuring that gifted items are consumed rather than
invested for profit.[^10]

## Historical Examples

### Traditional Societies

The Moka is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the Mount Hagen
area of Papua New Guinea, that has become emblematic of the
anthropological concepts of a "gift economy" and of a "big man"
political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts that raise the social status
of the giver if the gift is larger than one that the giver
received.[^11] The gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs
and scarce pearl shells from the coast.

The Toraja are an ethnic group indigenous to a mountainous region of
South Sulawesi, Indonesia.[^12] Torajans are renowned for their
elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and
massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as tongkonan which are
owned by noble families. Toraja funeral rites are important social
events where descendants compete through gifts of sacrificial
cattle.[^13]

### Modern Applications

Engineers, scientists and software developers have created free software
projects such as the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system. They are
prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the
technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of
permissive free software and copyleft licenses, which allow free reuse
of software and knowledge.[^14]

Many retail organizations have "gift" programs meant to encourage
customer loyalty to their establishments.[^15] "Give-away shops",
"freeshops" or "free stores" are stores where all goods are free,
similar to charity shops but with everything available at no cost.[^16]

## Commodity Exchange vs Gift Exchange

| Commodity exchange | Gift exchange |

| immediate exchange | delayed exchange |
| alienable goods | inalienable goods |
| actors independent | actors dependent |
| quantitative relationship between objects | qualitative relationship between people |

## Anarchist Perspectives

Many anarchists, particularly anarcho-primitivists and
anarcho-communists, believe that variations on a gift economy may be the
key to breaking the cycle of poverty. Therefore, they often desire to
refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists
advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets,
nor planning. This view traces back at least to Peter Kropotkin, who saw
in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "mutual
aid".[^17]

In place of a market, anarcho-communists support a gift economy without
currency, where goods and services are produced by workers and
distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers
who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want
or need as payment for their production of goods and services.[^18]

## Charity & Alms Giving

Anthropologist David Graeber argued that the great world religious
traditions of charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously
during the Axial Age (800 to 200 BCE), when coinage was invented and
market economies were established on a continental basis. Graeber argues
that these charity traditions emerged as a reaction against the nexus
formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market.[^19]

Charity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given
without expectation of return. However, case studies show that such
gifting is not necessarily altruistic.[^20] Theravada Buddhism in
Thailand emphasizes the importance of giving alms (merit making) without
any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished
according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples.[^21]

Dāna is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is
said to embody the sins of the giver (the "poison of the gift"), whom it
frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift
depends on finding a worthy recipient such as a Brahmin priest. Dana
thus transgresses the so-called universal "norm of reciprocity".[^22]

The Children of Peace (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect who built
the Sharon Temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of
Ontario's first shelter for the homeless. They found that the charity
they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor, as
accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the debtor could be
jailed without trial at the time. They thus transformed their charity
fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today's
micro-credit institutions.[^23]
