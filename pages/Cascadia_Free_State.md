At Warner Creek, Oregon, members of Earth First! conducted an 11-month
blockade from 1995 to 1996 that successfully protected the Warner Creek
forest from logging. Activists established a "Cascadia Free State" in
the middle of the only road to the forest, complete with "a watchtower,
a moat and drawbridge, a wide variety of barricades, and frequent
trainings and planning meetings for establishing other 'Free States'."

*Earth First! Journal* reported:

> The barricades begin below a former Forest Service gate, which has
> been converted into a wall by three barrels of cement fortified with
> rebar, 'locking' it permanently closed. If the Freddies do visit, they
> will first be greeted by a gatekeeper on the 15-foot high log wall and
> will soon need to ask very politely to enter if they expect the
> drawbridge to be lowered over the moat that is under construction.
> Friendly folks can come on up to the tent village where a large, dry
> living space has been created with tarps and equipped with a kitchen
> area, pantry, media table, and a warm fire circle. Tipis, shelters and
> tents are scattered all around, including one pitched right over the
> steel door lockdown set up in front of the gate. Above the gate stands
> a large, beautiful tipi constructed of downed trees and waterproofed
> with cedar bark found on the forest floor.[^2]

People dug large ditches in the road, chained themselves to logging
trucks and concrete-filled barrels, and erected a bipod that trucks
could not drive past without endangering the inhabitants. One supporter
held a 75-day hunger strike. Over the course of the summer, other free
states emerged in Oregon and Idaho. The camp attracted many visitors.
One resident estimated that between 500 and 1,000 supporters had come to
see it and help out. In August 1996, Forest Service authorities arrived
and let the protesters know the Clinton administration had decided not
to allow logging in the forest. It turned out they told the truth, but
at the time they refused to provide documentation. So, four
women--Lupin, Raven, Hemlock and Madrone--refused to leave and were
arrested. A bulldozer destroyed the camp, but the campaign had won. [^3]
