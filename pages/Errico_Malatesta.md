# Errico Malatesta

**Errico Malatesta** (4 December 1853 – 22 July 1932) was an Italian
anarchist propagandist, theorist and revolutionary. He edited several
anarchist newspapers and spent much of his life in exile and prison,
having been jailed and expelled from Italy, Britain, France, and
Switzerland. Originally a supporter of insurrectionary propaganda by
deed, Malatesta later advocated anarchist participation in syndicalist
organizing while maintaining critiques of syndicalism as an end in
itself. His exiles included periods in Europe and 12 years in Argentina,
where his organizing left a lasting anarchist influence on the workers'
movement.

## Early Life

Malatesta was born to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria
Maggiore, then part of the city of Capua in the Kingdom of the Two
Sicilies. His ancestors had ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. At
age fourteen, he was arrested for writing an "insolent and threatening"
letter to King Victor Emmanuel II - the first of many arrests throughout
his life.[^1]

He studied medicine at the University of Naples but was expelled in 1871
for participating in a demonstration. As a supporter of the Paris
Commune, he joined the Naples section of the International Working Men's
Association.

In 1872, Malatesta met Mikhail Bakunin and participated in the St. Imier
congress of the International. Over the following four years he was
arrested twice for agitational work on behalf of the International.

In April 1877, Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero, Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky and
about thirty others attempted an insurrection in the province of
Benevento. They took the villages of Letino and Gallo without struggle,
burnt tax registers and declared the end of the King's reign. After
leaving Gallo, they were arrested by government troops and held for
sixteen months before being acquitted.[^2]

Following Giovanni Passannante's attempt on King Umberto I's life,
anarchists came under intense police surveillance. Malatesta was forced
to leave Italy in the fall of 1878, beginning his life in exile.[^3]

## Years of Exile

### Early Exile

After brief periods in Egypt, Syria and Turkey, Malatesta landed in
Marseille and made his way to Geneva, Switzerland - then an anarchist
centre. There he befriended Élisée Reclus and Peter Kropotkin, helping
produce *La Révolte*. After a few months he was expelled from
Switzerland, travelling through Romania to Paris, where he worked as a
mechanic.[^4]

In 1881, Malatesta moved to London, where he would return intermittently
for the next 40 years, working as a mechanic and later opening an
electrical workshop.[^5]

Malatesta attended the July 1881 Anarchist Congress in London alongside
Peter Kropotkin, Francesco Saverio Merlino, Marie Le Compte, Louise
Michel and Émile Gautier. While respecting "complete autonomy of local
groups", the congress defined propaganda actions and agreed that
"propaganda by the deed" was the path to social revolution.[^6]

With the outbreak of the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, Malatesta organized
a small group to fight against the British. In August, he and three
others departed for Egypt, landing in Abu Qir before travelling toward
Alexandria. After a difficult crossing of Lake Mariout, they were
surrounded and detained by British forces without having undertaken any
fighting.[^7]

### Argentina

He secretly returned to Italy in 1883. In Florence he founded the weekly
anarchist paper *La Questione Sociale* (The Social Question), in which
his pamphlet *Fra contadini* (Among Farmers, later published in English
as *Between Peasants*) first appeared. While in Naples in 1884 waiting
to serve a three-year prison term, he nursed victims of a cholera
epidemic before fleeing to South America.

Malatesta lived in Buenos Aires from 1885 to 1889, resuming publication
of *La Questione Sociale* and organizing among Italian émigrés. He
helped found the first militant workers' union in Argentina, the Bakers
Union, laying groundwork for a lasting anarchist influence on Argentine
labor movements.[^8]

In 1902, the founding congress of the Unión Obrera Democrática
Filipina - the first national trade union federation in the
Philippines - adopted Malatesta's *Between Peasants* as part of the
political foundation of the movement.[^9]

### Return to Italy and Imprisonment

Returning to Europe in 1889, Malatesta first published *L'Associazione*
in Nice before returning to London.

The late 1890s brought social turmoil to Italy, with bad harvests,
rising prices and peasant revolts. Strikes met government repression. In
early 1898, Malatesta returned to Ancona to participate in the anarchist
movement among dockworkers. He was soon identified as a leader during
street fighting with police and arrested, preventing his further
participation in the industrial and political actions of 1898 and
1899.[^10]

From jail, Malatesta opposed electoral participation on behalf of
liberal and socialist politicians, contradicting Saverio Merlino and
other anarchist leaders who argued for electoral participation as an
emergency measure. Malatesta was convicted of "seditious association"
and sentenced to imprisonment on the island of Lampedusa.[^11]

### Escape and Later Activities

He escaped from prison in May 1899 with the help of comrades around the
world, including anarchists in Paterson, New Jersey, London and Tunis.
Greek sponge fishermen helped him reach Sousse, from where he made his
way to London via Malta and Gibraltar.[^12]

In subsequent years, Malatesta visited the United States, speaking to
anarchists in Italian and Spanish immigrant communities.[^13] Back in
London, he was closely watched by police, who increasingly regarded
anarchists as a threat following the July 1900 assassination of Umberto
I by an Italian anarchist who had been living in Paterson, New
Jersey.[^14]

By 1910, Malatesta had opened an electrical workshop in London at 15
Duncan Terrace Islington. On 15 January 1910, he sold oxyacetylene
cutting equipment to George Gardenstein for use in the Houndsditch
robbery, which became the precursor to the Siege of Sidney Street.

While based in London, Malatesta made clandestine trips to France,
Switzerland and Italy and went on a lecture tour of Spain with Fernando
Tarrida del Mármol. During this time, he wrote several pamphlets,
including *L'Anarchia*.[^15]

## Amsterdam Congress and Critique of Syndicalism

Malatesta participated in the International Anarchist Congress of
Amsterdam in 1907, where he debated with Pierre Monatte on the relation
between anarchism and syndicalism. Monatte thought that syndicalism was
revolutionary and would create the conditions of social revolution,
while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not
sufficient.

Malatesta thought that trade unions were reformist and could even be
conservative. Along with Christiaan Cornelissen, he cited labor unions
in the United States as an example, where trade unions composed of
skilled workers sometimes opposed unskilled workers to defend their
relatively privileged position. Malatesta warned that syndicalists aimed
at perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have
overthrowing capitalism and the state as their end.[^16]

In his view, unions typically sought gains for workers within the
framework of capitalist social relations and waged labor. The goal was
instead to end those relations and abolish the system of waged labor
itself. Unions often worked with employers as a management layer that
imposed contract conditions and disciplined workers between bargaining
periods. Unions divided workers by trade, workplace or skill set, with
some workers using unions to maintain their relative privilege over
others.

Malatesta's arguments against anarcho-syndicalism were later developed
in a series of articles, where he wrote that "I am against syndicalism,
both as a doctrine and a practice, because it strikes me as a hybrid
creature."[^17] Despite their drawbacks, he advocated activity in trade
unions, both because they were necessary for worker organization and
self-defense under capitalism, and as a way of reaching broader masses.
However, "anarchists should not want the unions to be anarchist."[^18]

Malatesta thought that syndicalism "is by nature reformist" like all
unions.[^19] While anarchists should be active in the rank and file, he
said "any anarchist who has agreed to become a permanent and salaried
official of a trade union is lost to anarchism."[^20]

Malatesta advocated the development of explicitly anarchist
organizations to sustain a unity of theory and practice that would
encourage revolutionary work and support the theoretical and tactical
development of anarchism, rather than succumbing to concerns over
immediate day-to-day issues that dominate trade union work.

## World War I and Final Years

With the outbreak of World War I, Malatesta opposed his comrade Peter
Kropotkin, who had argued for the victory of French culture over German
barbarism. For Malatesta, bourgeois wars were no option for working
class people who would be massacred in defense of the interests of one
ruling class over another.

After World War I, Malatesta returned to Italy for the final time. Two
years later, in 1921, the Italian government imprisoned him again,
though he was released two months before the fascists came to power.
From 1924 until 1926, when Benito Mussolini silenced all independent
press, Malatesta published the journal *Pensiero e Volontà*, though it
suffered from government censorship and harassment.

He spent his remaining years living quietly, earning a living as an
electrician. After years of suffering from a weak respiratory system and
regular bronchial attacks, he developed bronchial pneumonia. He died on
22 July 1932. He was an atheist.[^21]

## Political Beliefs

Malatesta remained devoted to anarchism throughout his life when other
leaders of the International changed their opinions or abandoned
politics. He was able to do so by modifying his optimistic approach,
substituting a more sophisticated version of anarchism.

By the 1880s and early 1900s, Malatesta developed a two-pronged
strategy. On one hand, he sought to unify anarchists and
anti-parliamentary socialists into a new anarchist socialist party, as
anarchism was a minority movement within the Italian left. On the other
hand, Malatesta was one of the first anarchists to stress a syndicalist
strategy, arguing that anarchists had to prod socialists into
insurrections and remain a revolutionary conscience during socialist
reconstruction.

Malatesta defined his type of anarchist communism as "anarchism without
adjectives" - a concept he developed with Spanish anarchist
intellectuals while mediating between mutually hostile collectivists and
communists. In stressing tolerance within the libertarian movement,
Malatesta hoped that Marxist socialists would permit anarchists liberty
for their own movement in post-revolutionary society.[^22]

The label "anarchist socialism" came to characterize Malatesta's brand
of anarchism as he proclaimed the socialist character of anarchism and
urged anarchists to regain contact with the working masses through
involvement in the labor movement. For Malatesta, the issue was no
longer hegemony, but the contrast between an exclusive view of
socialism, for which one political idea was to be hegemonic, and an
inclusive one, for which multiple political views were to coexist,
united in the economic struggle.[^23]

Malatesta maintained a principled perspective of anarchism as a
revolutionary theory and argued that violence, rather than a moral
issue, was a necessity of working class efforts to gain emancipation.

## Influences and Legacy

Anarchists who influenced Malatesta's political beliefs included
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Carlo Cafiero, Peter Kropotkin
and Élisée Reclus.[^24]

In turn, Malatesta's works influenced Marxist philosopher Antonio
Gramsci and anarcha-feminist activist Virginia Bolten,[^25] as well as
the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation[^26] and wider Argentine
anarchist movement.[^27]

His works have been taken up by activists in contemporary anarchist and
alternative globalization movements, making him among the most
influential anarchists in contemporary movements.
