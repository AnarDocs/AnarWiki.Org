### Research Articles

- “The Power of Instability: Unraveling the Microfoundations of
  Bargained Authoritarianism in China" by Ching Kwan Lee & Yonghong

### Books

- “The Political Ideas of Marx and Engels, Vol I&II" by Richard N. Hunt
  Volume I- <https://b-ok.asia/book/2668551/896667> \[PDF, 35.73 MB,
  EN\] Volume II- <https://b-ok.asia/book/2668654/9945b8> \[PDF, 45.81
  MB, EN\] (shows how the most common beliefs held by the authoritarian
  leftists are clearly dissociated with Marx and Engels’s own views.
  Volume I demonstrates that Marx did not believe in a vanguard party,
  unbridled red terror, a revolution carried out by a minority group and
  undemocratic party structures. It also clarifies how the term
  ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ has been hijacked by authoritarian
  leftists. Volume II deals with how Marxist view of the state is
  falsified by authoritarian leftists and discusses questions of
  revolutionary strategy advocated by Marx and shows how the Marxist
  conception of a revolution is intensely democratic)
