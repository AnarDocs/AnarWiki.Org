# Theories of Authoritarianism

Marxist-Leninists view authoritarianism as a necessary transitional tool
for building socialism, arguing that centralized state power, one-party
rule, suppression of dissent, and hierarchical control are essential to
defend revolutionary gains from counter-revolution, coordinate complex
industrial economies, and transform society until classes are eliminated
and the state can eventually "wither away." They justify temporary
dictatorship—the "dictatorship of the proletariat"—as serving
working-class interests even when it involves coercion, claiming that
only a strong centralized state can survive capitalist encirclement and
organize production effectively during the transition to communism.

In stark contrast, anarchists and non-hierarchical socialists argue that
authoritarianism fundamentally betrays socialist principles because the
means shape the ends—authoritarian methods cannot produce libertarian
outcomes. They contend that states have autonomous interests in
self-perpetuation regardless of revolutionary intentions, that
concentration of power inevitably creates new ruling classes (as
predicted by Bakunin and validated by Soviet experience), and that
centralized control alienates workers just as capitalism does, merely
replacing private bosses with state managers. Rather than accepting
temporary dictatorship, anarchists insist on immediate implementation of
horizontal organization, direct democracy, workers' self-management, and
voluntary federation, arguing that decentralized structures are both
more effective and more consistent with socialist goals, and pointing to
the 87.5% failure rate of Marxist-Leninist states as evidence that the
promised "withering away" never materializes—authoritarian power
perpetuates itself indefinitely.

  Volume I- <https://b-ok.asia/book/2668551/896667> \[PDF, 35.73 MB,

  MB, EN\] (shows how the most common beliefs held by the authoritarian
  leftists are clearly dissociated with Marx and Engels’s own views.
  Volume I demonstrates that Marx did not believe in a vanguard party,
  unbridled red terror, a revolution carried out by a minority group and
  undemocratic party structures. It also clarifies how the term
  ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ has been hijacked by authoritarian
  leftists. Volume II deals with how Marxist view of the state is
  falsified by authoritarian leftists and discusses questions of
  revolutionary strategy advocated by Marx and shows how the Marxist
  conception of a revolution is intensely democratic)
