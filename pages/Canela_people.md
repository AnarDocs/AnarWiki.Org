The Canela people, in what's now "Maranhão, Brazil," traditionally
relied on a mix of gathering, hunting and gardening. Anthropologists
William Crocker and Jean Crocker describe their society as "relatively
egalitarian" with "minimal material resources and ceremonial
hierarchy."[^1]

They've been pushed off about 90 percent of their land since the early
nineteenth century, they have shifted to a predominantly gardening-based
mode of subsistence with gathering and hunting providing much less of
their food. For the Canela, gardening is a means of resisting
assimilation and maintaining autonomy. A Canela member named Renato has
explained how gardening enables them to maintain a relative autonomy:
"Today we are still preoccupied with creating gardens. Why? To not
suffer from hunger. Because having rice, beans, fava beans, maize,
peanut — then one can survive."[^2]

# Culture

The Canela live in circular-shaped villages where no household can be
considered the head. Each household is managed by women. Lineage is
matrilineal, and residence is matrilocal. Chris Knight comments on
gender relations: "Men are certainly not more powerful than the women.
The women own the homes \[...\] Home is where everything happens. It's
the central power in the whole village."[^3]

Before colonialism, the Crockers explain, "the Canela formerly had no
god, did not worship or pray to any supernatural being. and did not try
to influence supernarural entities to bring about improvements in their
harvest and living condition."[^4]

Historically, practices of public and private extramarital sex
contributed to the culture's "strong ethic of caring and
generosity."[^5]

# Decisions

Crocker and Crocker describe the historic Canela as being "governed by
chiefs who gave orders that were obeyed because of custom rather than
force."[^6]

Dancing rituals in the middle of each village form the central focus of
self-governance.[^7]

# Crime

At assemblies in the village center, residents share news and address
disputes.[^8]

# Environment

Renzo Connors writes on the ecologically-oriented lifestyle of the
Canela people:

> `The Canela’s subsistence gardening approach is totally different from monocrop agriculture. They work with nature using a conscious ecological and more biodiverse method.Typically in agriculture only a small variety of cash crops are grown in large fields covering acres upon acres of land where in the Amazon large sections of jungle are destroyed. For the Canela gardners instead of being dependent on a small variety of cash crops they cultivate over 300 varieties of plants to meet their subsistence needs. Instead of using destructive hellish machines like bulldozers, ploughs, and combine harvesters they use a slash and burn method to clear small patches just enough for them to use and their tools consist of a digging stick and woven baskets. They only use the same garden for two years and then not use the same area for at least eight years to allow the forest to regrow and return fertility to the soil.`
