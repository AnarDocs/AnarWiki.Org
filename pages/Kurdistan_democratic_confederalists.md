With a population of 30 million, the Kurds are the world's largest
stateless people. They form the majority of Kurdistan, a region in
Turkey, Iran, Syria and Iraq. Since 1999, their struggle for
self-determination has taken an anarchstic turn, and communities in
Kurdistan have established direct democratic governance modelled on the
anti-authoritarian <a href="Zapatista-run_Chiapas" class="wikilink"
title="neo-Zapatista movement">neo-Zapatista movement</a> and the
theories of US anarchist Murray Bookchin. While Kurds comprise the
majority, the movement has been diverse and multi-ethnic. For example,
in the canton of Jazira in Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan), Kurds, Arabs,
Syriacs, Chechens, Armenians, Muslims, Christians and Yazidis co-exist
and share political power.[^1]

Founded in 1975, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, traditionally
operated as a Marxist-Leninist party, demanding a Kurdish state
independent from Turkey. A quarter-century later, their struggle took a
sharply anarchistic turn, due in large part to evolving theories of the
movement's political prisoner Abdullah Öcalan. The PKK and other rebels
have since established the Group of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK), a
confederation of direct democratic communal institutions across Turkish
Kurdistan. KCK-affiliated groups have expanded the anti-authoritarian
Kurdish social revolution into Iran, Syria and Iraq.

In Rojava, (Syrian Kurdistan), the coalition TEV-DEM has led a direct
democratic social revolution partially on Bookchin's ideas since 2012,
while the People’s Protection Units (YPG) and Women’s Protection Units
(YPJ) have defended the territory from the jihadist group ISIS. Before
the civil war, Rojava had 3.5 million residents, but now just over 2.5
million people live there.[^2] In the assessment of Black Rose Anarchist
Federation, "The Rojava Revolution has probably made more concrete
progress towards libertarian socialism than any other large-scale
struggle at least since the Zapatista insurrection."[^3]

# Bakur (Northern, or Turkish Kurdistan)

In 1999, PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was arrested by Turkish authorities,
and in prison Öcalan became heavily influenced by American anarchist
Murray Bookchin and the Zapatistas. Öcalan embraced Bookchin's theory of
Communalism and renamed it "democratic confederalism." As Öcalan
reflected and criticized his party's authoritarian past, Öcalan's
followers too became swayed. Rafael Taylor writes, "The PKK itself has
apparently taken after their leader, not only adopting Bookchin's
specific brand of eco-anarchism, but actively internalizing the new
philosophy in its strategy and tactics. The movement abandoned its
bloody war for Stalinist/Maoist revolution and the terror tactics that
came with it, and began pursuing a largely non-violent strategy aimed at
greater regional autonomy."[^4]

The PKK and other Kurdish rebels in Turkey established the KCK, a direct
democratic confederation that makes decisions at five levels: the
village, the neighborhood, the district, the city, and the region
(northern Kurdistan). Taylor reports, “The informal consensus among
witnesses, nevertheless, is that the majority of decision-making is
directly democratic through one arrangement or other; that the majority
of those decisions are made at the grassroots; and that the decisions
are executed from the bottom-up in accordance with the federal
structure.” The highest level of the the KCK, the Democratic Society
Congress or DTK,requires that women constitute at least 40 percent of
each assembly. Although DTK members include representatives of a wide
variety of Kurdish civil society organizations, 60 percent of DTK
members are recallable delegates from the direct democratic
grassroots.[^5]

In June 2013, youth in the town of Cizre formed a guerilla group called
the Revolutionary Patriotic Movement (YDG-H). The word "patriotic" in
their name refers to love of their homeland, not love of any state,
according to an anonymous visitor who wrote "Understanding the Kurdish
Resistance".[^6] In early 2015, the group seized three neighborhoods in
Cizre and established an autonomous zone for two months. They dug 184
ditches around the neighborhoods so that police vehicles could not get
through (the youth used ditches rather than barricades since the police
vehicles could plow through barricades and police were not allowed to
exit their vehicles). Öcalan intervened and got the ditches closed on 2
March. On 4 September, Turkish military and police invaded Cizre for
nine days. 21 civilians were found dead after the invasion.[^7]

Elanor Finley, a board member of the Institute for Social Ecology,
writes:

# Bashur or Başûr (Southern, or Iraqi Kurdistan)

In 2014, KCK-affiliated fighters, including the PKK, fought the
far-right Islamist group ISIS and rescued thousands of Yadizis trapped
and terrorized by ISIS in Iraq's Sinjar Mountains.[^9] In Başûr, Yedizi
women have taken a leading role in establishing direct-democratic
governance structures such as the Şengal Democratic Autonomy
Assembly.[^10]

The Mexmûr refugee camp, with 12,000 Kurdish residents, has “established
its own civil society structures, education and health care system, and
economy” (159). Mexmûris “present their camp as an autonomous
alternative to the nation-state system." District councils send
delegates to a campwide People’s Assembly. There are no prisons.
“\[M\]urder and theft are rare.” When deemed necessary, punishment may
look like “writing a self-critical report, reading up on topics, or
taking up specific duties in the organized structures” (168).[^11]

# Rojava (Western, or Syrian Kurdistan)

Officially known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East
Syria (AANES), Rojava meaning "west" in Kurdish, has 7 regions with 4 to
5 million residents.[^12]

Starting on June 19, 2012, Kurdish fighters liberated Rojava, the Syrian
region of Kurdistan, with the three cantons of Kobani, Afrin, and
Jazira. In these liberated territories, locally-elected councils in each
community make decisions regarding topics such as energy, food supplies,
and patriarchal violence. The Rojava territories are governed by the
Democratic Society Movement (TEV-DEM), a coalition which includes the
Democratic Union Party (PYD). The People’s Protection Units (YPG) and
Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) defend the territories. While the YPJ has
women commanders and militants, the YPJ consists entirely of women.[^13]
On 17 March 2016, the PYD and allied groups officially declared Rojava
an autonomous, federated area.[^14] In December 2016, the autonomous
government adopted the name "Northern Syria" for the region, dropping
the Kurdish word "Rojava" in order to emphasize the society's
multi-ethnic nature.[^15]

## Culture

In a region with strongly patriarchal traditions, the Rojava uprising
has instituted significant advances in the position of women, as the
social ecologist scholar Janet Biehl summarizes:

> But today the women of Rojava have shaken off that tradition and
> participate fully in public life: at every level of politics and
> society. Institutional leadership consists not of one position but
> two, one male and one female official — for the sake of gender
> equality and also to keep power from concentrating into one person’s
> hands.
>
> Representatives of Yekitiya Star, the umbrella organization for
> women’s groups, explained that women are essential to democracy — they
> even defined the antagonist of women’s freedom, strikingly, not as
> patriarchy but as the nation-state and capitalist modernity. The
> women’s revolution aims to free everyone. Women are to this revolution
> what the proletariat was to Marxist-Leninist revolutions of the past
> century. It has profoundly transformed not only women’s status but
> every aspect of society.
>
> Even the traditionally male-dominated strands of society, like the
> military, have been profoundly transformed. The people’s protection
> units (YPG) have been joined by the YPJ — or women’s protection units
> — whose images by now have become world famous. Together, the YPG and
> the YPJ are defending society against the jihadist forces of ISIS and
> Al-Nusra with Kalashnikovs and, perhaps equally formidably, a fierce
> intellectual and emotional commitment not only to their community’s
> survival but to its political ideas and aspirations too.[^16]

Some queer activists in the movement contend that the movement's
official line on gender is essentialist and excludes transgendered and
other queer identities.[^17]

## Decisions

Rojava residents make decisions in a participatory democratic process
based in part of anarchist principles of local autonomy and
confederation. Local councils confederate at four levels from the street
or village up to the region of Rojava. At each level, all councils
require at least 40 percent of participants to be women. In addition to
the councils based on locality, people form councils at the
neighborhood, Communities also have commissions which administer
criminal justice, establish worker cooperatives, protect the
environment, and organize defense.[^18]

In March 2022, *The Nation* reported that Rojava's quota of women's
participation was "soon to be changed to 50 percent."<ref>Anna Rebrii
and Ariella Patchen, "Celebrating Zapatista and Kurdish Women’s
Struggles, on International Women’s Day," *The Nation*, 8 March 2022,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/world/zapatista-rojava-womens-movement/>.<ref>

The levels of governance, according to *Revolution in Rojava* are the
commune, the neighborhood, the district, and the region. Each level has
commissions in the following eight areas: women, defense, economics,
politics, civil society, free society, justice, and ideology. A health
commission is also indirectly connected to this governance structure. A
commune consists or a city's residential street or a rural village, with
about 20 to 200 households. A commune usually has a public assembly
every month or every two months. Anyone can attend regardless of their
party affiliation or ethnicity. The commune has a bi-annually or
annually elected coordinating board whose members can be recalled by the
commune's members. The board includes two co-chairs (one man and one
woman) and a representative from each of the commissions. The board
meets weekly, and residents are welcome to attend and voice opinions.
The neighborhood council confederates seven to 30 commmunes and has 15
to 30 members who are required to follow mandates from the communes that
elected them. Neighborhoods confederate into districts, and districts
confederate into the People's Council of Western Kurdistan (MGRK).[^19]

*A Small Key Can Open a Large Door* describes the same four-level
council system using different translations of the terminology:
neighborhoods, districts, cities, and region. This book adds that while
neighborhood assemblies' standard procedure is to vote, but many
neighborhood councils make decisions by consensus. Any adult or teenager
can attend those meetings. Neighborhood councils, with an average size
of 30-50 families, confederate into district councils, each with 5-17
neighborhood councils. The district councils, then, confederate into
city councils, and the city councils confederate into the Supreme
Council of the Rojava Cantons.[^20]

There is a tension between the grassroots anti-authoritarian structure
at the local level and the statist structure at the confederal level
with legislative, executive and judicial bodies.[^21] According to
Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness, the local councils remain autonomous
from the the upper governmental structures, and no decision made by an
higher council is binding in a given neighborhood until it is ratified
by the neighborhood council. Strangers write, "There is no federal
government in the Rojava canton system."[^22] In contrast, Black Rose
Anarchist Federation argues, "the PYD has created a new minimal state
instead of abolishing the state".[^23]

The anthropologist David Graeber comments, "I don’t think I’ve ever
heard of anywhere else in the world where there’s been a dual power
situation where the same political forces created both sides. There’s
the 'democratic self-administration,' which has all the form and
trappings of a state -Parliament, Ministries, and so on- but it was
created to be carefully separated from the means of coercive power. Then
you have the TEV-DEM (The Democratic Society Movement), driven bottom up
directly democratic institutions. Ultimately -and this is key- the
security forces are answerable to the bottom-up structures and not to
the top-down ones."[^24]

According to Dilar Dirik, Syriacs in particular have found a role for
themselves in the AANES’s Democratic Confederalist project, and Syriac
women lead an effort to conserve the Aramaic language spoken by
<a href="Early_Christians" class="wikilink" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus
Christ</a>.[^25]

A majority of the region's residents are most likely Arab.[^26] Most of
them seem to be quite skeptical of the Kurdish-initiated transformation.
However, some Arabs do support Democratic Confederalism. For example,
Khawla Diad told *Haaretz*, “At first we thought it was a nationalist
revolution for the Kurds, not a revolution for peoples’ brotherhood and
democracy. But \[Apo is Öcalan’s nickname meaning "uncle"\] Apo’s
ideology was far-reaching. Slowly we saw that this ideology was not only
for Kurds, but also for Arabs and Assyrians, and especially for women.”
Some Arabs have joined the SDF because, apart from the practical reasons
of needing salaries and wanting to fight ISIS and Turkey, they “support
at least some, if not all, of the basic political principles upon which
the SDF and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria
(AANES) are based" according to the Middle East Research and Information
Project.[^27]

## Economics

In late 2012, the Rojava cantons officially eliminated private property,
transferring ownership of all buildings, lands, and infrastructure to
the city councils. The councils grant people a right to "ownership by
use", meaning the people that personally use a building or a piece of
land or infrastructure are the legal owners. According to economic
co-minister Dr. Ahmad Yousef, three-quarters of property is now commonly
held, and the rest personally possessed. Although Article 41 of the
Rojava Constitution enshrines a right to private property, this right
may refer to the types of personal possessions like houses that Proudhon
called possessions.[^28]

In practice, the abolition of private property may be far from complete.
"\[M\]uch of the land and capital is intended to remain in private
hands," and "foreign corporate investment is pursued," according to
Black Rose.[^29]

Oil is Rojava's main resource, and the region produces about 40,000
barrels daily.[^30] About a third of enterprises have been turned into
worker cooperatives so far, according to the Ministry of Economics.[^31]
Visiting Rojava, Janet Biehl saw a sewing cooperative, a greenhouse
cooperative, and a dairy cooperative. Rojava imports just enough oil to
meet its own needs and uses its own two refineries.[^32]

The autonomous government has not levied any taxes on its residents or
on its businesses. Most of the government's revenue comes from the sale
of oil to its own residents, and to outside the region through a black
market. An embargo on Rojava enforced by Turkey prevents Rojava from
legally exporting oil.[^33]

The Rojavan schools are "non-traditional, rejecting ideas of hierarchy,
power and hegemony. Instead of following a teacher-student hierarchy,
students teach each other and learn from each other’s experience.
Students learn what is useful, in practical matters; they 'search for
meaning,' as we were told, in intellectual matters. They do not
memorize; they learn to think for themselves and make decisions, to
become the subjects of their own lives."[^34]

Andrew Flood describes 3 central elements of Rojava's economy:

> So far as I understand economic change in Rojava is happening at the
> level of 1. setting up co-ops (with agricultural ones using land
> abandoned by the Assad regime ). 2. providing certain necessities free
> (so partial filling of the requirement for wage abolition), but from
> the Point of View of consumption rather than production. 3. a certain
> amount of war communism - again a form of wage abolition but not
> necessarily intended to be long term. In Kobane under siege food was
> reported by BBC journalists as being freely available to all.[^35]

## Environment

Neighborhoods establish councils specifically dedicated to environmental
protection.[^36] David Graeber describes an encounter with

> a doctor, he looks like a slightly scary Syrian military type in a
> leather jacket and stern austere expression. Then you talk to him and
> he explains: “Well, we feel the best approach to public health is
> preventative, most disease is made possible by stress. We feel if we
> reduce stress, levels of heart disease, diabetes, even cancer will
> decline. So our ultimate plan is to reorganize the cities to be 70%
> green space...[^37]

There are deep contradictions in the effort to build a green society in
a region dependent on oil extraction. Although Janet Biehl reported in
2014 that “The local oil industry, if such it can be called, produces
only enough for local needs, nothing more,” the SDF was selling oil and
gas to the Assad regime by 2019 and was making a business deal in 2020
with the U.S. oil company Delta Crescent Energy."<ref>Dan Fischer, "An
Ambiguous Paradise Built in Hell," *New Politics*, 7 January 2023,
<https://newpol.org/an-ambiguous-paradise-built-in-hell/>.<ref>

## Crime

In addition to the communal commissions in charge of criminal justice,
Rojavans have their own civilian security forces, or the Asayish.
According to Biehl, "The Asayis reject the label police, since police
serve the state whereas they serve society." The Asayish have to take a
six-week training in nonviolent conflict resolution and feminism
training before they are allowed to touch a gun. The ultimate aim is to
give police training to everyone so that they can eliminate professional
police. Rojava has abolished capital punishment.[^38] Parallel to the
Asayish, an all-women's security force called the Asayish-J, "is alone
responsible for crimes involving women, children, domestic abuse, and
hate crimes" in addition to sharing the peacekeeping functions of the
co-ed Asayish.[^39]

Rojava's liberated areas still maintain prisons, and Human Rights Watch
has accused Asayish of arbitrary arrests, prisoner abuse, and unresolved
disappearances and killings.[^40]

## Revolution

With a combined force of 40,000 people, the People’s Protection Units
(YPG) and Women’s Protection Units (YPJ) defend the territories. About
35 percent of these fighters are women.[^41] While the YPJ consists
entirely of women, the YPG has women members including commanders and
militants. "\[T\]he leadership of the YPG is often more like 50-60%
women as it recruits heavily from the leadership of the YPJ," according
to Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness.[^42] Military units elect their
leaders.[^43] Paul Z. Simons reported in 2015:

> There are no officers. When engaged in operations, the fighters choose
> (by vote or consensus) Team/Suite/Block/Company Leaders. When idle,
> there is no leadership structure at any level, save Regional Commands.
> Commanders are chosen (vote or consensus) for regions and Cantons
> (Kobane, Qamishli) and can only serve six months in any given
> commando. Then they are replaced. There is no re-election."[^44]

Human Rights Watch has found that despite official YPG and Asayish
policy forbidding the use of minors in combat, both bodies have employed
minors.[^45]

Some residents oppose Rojava's conscription of people into the YPG and
YPJ.[^46]

In September 2014, ISIS attacked the city of Kobani (in the canton of
Kobane), and by early October, the journalist Patrick Cockburn reported
that ISIS was "close to capturing" Kobani.[^47] While the Free Syrian
Army and the Turkish anarchist group DAF travelled to Kobani and joined
the town's fight against ISIS.[^48], the US and its ally Turkey
virtually abandoned the city. US Secretary of State John Kerry explained
that defending Kobani was not a "strategic objective,"[^49] and, in the
midst of a bombing campaign in Syria, refused at first to carry out
meaningful airstrikes against ISIS near Kobani or to send aid and
weapons to the Kurdish rebels. Turkey, while enabling ISIS fighters to
freely cross its Syrian border, refused to allow Kurdish fighters,
weapons and supplies from Syria to reach Rojava.[^50] As the fighting
continued, however, the US drastically increased its airstrikes in
Kobani, in part for "propaganda reasons" according to the BBC's
diplomatic and defense editor Mark Urban.[^51]

On October 17, after a month of fighting, the KCK-affilliated militias
the YPG and YPJ forced ISIS to begin withdrawing from Kobani.[^52] By
October 19, the US began airlifting arms and supplies to Kobani. The
anonymous author of "Understanding the Kurdish Resistance" comments,
"Beyond a doubt, without that aerial support, the minimally-armed YPG
forces would not have emerged victorious."[^53] Journalist Bill Weinberg
argues that while this support should not stop anarchists from standing
with Kobani, it does set up conditions for the US to betray the Kurds'
struggle.

> We can only anticipate that Washington will sell out the YPG in
> deference to NATO ally Turkey as soon as ISIS has been beaten back at
> Kobani. There's a long history of such betrayals that anarchists know
> all too well. Exactly like Trotsky used the Makhnovists to help defeat
> the Whites, then crushed them. Exactly as the Spanish Republic used
> the Catalan anarchists. Exactly as Carranza used Villa and Zapata. *Et
> cetera.*[^54]

## Ethnic Cleansing allegations

Some human rights observers, notably Amnesty International, have accused
the Syrian Kurds of ethnic cleansing territories of Arab residents. The
YPG and the Ruspîs Assembly of Arab Tribes in Cizîr Canton have
responded that ethnic cleansing is not occurring.

On 30 May 2015, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that
local sources had accused the YPG of killing 20 Arab civilians in Ras
al-Ayn and burning and bulldozing Arab civilians' houses in Ras al-Ayn
and Tal Tamer.[^55] The YPG denied the charge of killing Arab civilians
in Ras al-Ayn, claiming that ISIS had held these civilians as human
shields and then detonated a booby-trapped vehicle when they tried to
walk toward YPG forces.[^56] Speaking to *ARA News*, Arab residents of
Tal Tamer denied that the YPG had displaced Arabs or destroyed their
homes.[^57]

On 13 October, Amnesty International released a report accusing the PYD
and YPG of ethnic cleansing directed against against Arabs and Turkmen.
In response, the Cizîr Canton's Ruspîs Assembly of Arab Tribes responded
in defense of the YPG: "Amnesty International has grounded its report on
sources that want to eliminate the love and co-existence among all
social circles of the region and replace it with enmity."[^58] The YPG
General Command commented, "the YPG and its affiliates, whose members
firmly believe in ethnic and religious diversity and fight against
global terrorism to achieve peace and security, would never tolerate or
condone violations or abuses might be carried out by its fighters
regardless of their position or rank."[^59]
