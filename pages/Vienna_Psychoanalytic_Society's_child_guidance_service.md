Austrian teacher August Aichhorn (1878-1949) set up a child guidance
service for the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, after completing
psychoanalytic training in 1922.[^1]

From Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action [^2]:

> Aichhorn was an equally bold man of the same generation who ran a home
> for maladjusted children in Vienna. He gives this description of one
> particularly aggressive group: 'Their aggressive acts became more
> frequent and more violent until practically all the furniture in the
> building was destroyed, the window panes broken, the doors nearly
> kicked to pieces. It happened once that a boy sprang through a double
> window ignoring his injuries from the broken glass. The dinner table
> was finally deserted because each one sought out a corner in the
> playroom where he crouched to devour his food. Screams and howls could
> be heard from afar!'[^3]
>
> Aichhorn and his colleagues maintained what one can only call a
> superhuman restraint and faith in their method, protecting their
> charges from the wrath of the neighbours, the police and the city
> authorities, and 'Eventually patience brought its reward. Not only did
> the children settle down, but they developed a strong attachment to
> those who were working with them . . . This attachment was now to be
> used as the foun­dation of a process of re-education. The children were
> at last to be brought up against the limitations imposed upon them by
> the real world.'[^4]
