# The Sexual Revolution

The **sexual revolution**, also known as **sexual liberation**, was a
<a href="social_movement" class="wikilink"
title="social movement">social movement</a> that challenged traditional
codes of behavior related to
<a href="sexuality" class="wikilink" title="sexuality">sexuality</a> and
interpersonal relationships throughout the
<a href="Western_world" class="wikilink" title="Western world">Western
world</a> from the late 1950s to the early 1970s. The movement
represented a fundamental challenge to state and religious authority
over personal life, asserting individual autonomy in sexual matters and
rejecting hierarchical control over intimate relationships.

## Anarchist Perspective

From Colin Ward, <a href="Anarchy_in_Action" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchy in Action">Anarchy in Action</a>:

> One essentially anarchist revolution that has advanced enormously in
> our own day is the sexual revolution. It is anarchist precisely
> because it involves denying the authority of the regulations laid down
> by the state and by various religious enterprises over the activities
> of the individual. And we can claim that it has advanced, not because
> of the 'breakdown' of the family that moralists (quite erroneously)
> see all around them, but because in Western society more and more
> people have decided to conduct their sexual lives as they see best.
> Those who have prophesied dreadful consequences as a result of the
> greater sexual freedom which the young assert - unwanted babies,
> venereal disease and so on - are usually the very same people who seek
> the fulfilment of their prophesies by opposing the free availability
> to the young of contraception and the removal of the stigma and
> mystification that surround venereal disease.

## Origins and Theoretical Development

### Anarchist Foundations

The intellectual groundwork for the sexual revolution was significantly
influenced by anarchist and anarchist-adjacent thinkers.
<a href="Otto_Gross" class="wikilink" title="Otto Gross">Otto Gross</a>
and
<a href="Wilhelm_Reich" class="wikilink" title="Wilhelm Reich">Wilhelm
Reich</a>, both combining anarchist and Marxist perspectives with
Freudian psychoanalysis, developed theories linking sexual liberation to
broader social revolution in the 1910s through 1930s.[^1]

Reich famously coined the phrase "sexual revolution" and argued that
sexual repression served authoritarian power structures. He contended
that liberating sexual behavior was essential to dismantling
hierarchical social relations and achieving genuine freedom. This
analysis identified sexuality as a key site where state power, religious
authority, and capitalist social relations intersected to control
individual bodies and desires.

The anarchist critique understood sexual regulation as part of a broader
system of social control. Traditional marriage laws, criminalization of
homosexuality, restrictions on contraception, and obscenity laws were
all mechanisms through which the state enforced conformity and
maintained patriarchal authority.

### Free Love Movement

The <a href="free_love" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>
movement, with strong anarchist roots dating to the 19th century,
advocated separating the state from sexual matters including marriage,
birth control, and adultery. Free love advocates argued these issues
concerned only the people involved, rejecting external authority over
intimate relationships.[^2]

Early anarchist publications like *The Word* and *Lucifer the
Light-Bearer* championed sexual autonomy, birth control access, and
voluntary relationships free from legal or religious sanction. Anarchist
feminists like
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> connected sexual freedom to women's liberation, arguing that
women's control over their own bodies and sexuality was fundamental to
achieving equality.

## The Movement

### 1960s-70s Developments

The sexual revolution accelerated dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s,
driven by several factors that aligned with anarchist principles of
autonomy and mutual aid:

**Contraceptive Technology**: The development of the birth control pill
in 1960 gave individuals, particularly women, unprecedented control over
reproduction, removing a major source of sexual regulation and fear.[^3]

**Legal Victories**: Court cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965)
challenged state control over contraception, establishing privacy rights
that undermined government authority over sexual decisions. These
victories represented successful resistance to state interference in
personal life.

**Cultural Shift**: The <a href="counterculture" class="wikilink"
title="counterculture">counterculture</a> embraced sexual
experimentation as part of broader rejection of traditional authority.
Communes and alternative living arrangements experimented with
non-monogamous relationships, challenging nuclear family structures.

**Liberation Movements**: The sexual revolution intersected with
anarcha-feminist and LGBT liberation movements, which understood sexual
freedom as inseparable from broader struggles against hierarchy and
domination.

### Challenging Authority

The sexual revolution directly confronted multiple forms of
institutional power:

**State Power**: By demanding decriminalization of homosexuality,
abortion access, and contraception availability, the movement challenged
the state's claimed right to regulate private behavior.

**Religious Authority**: Rejecting religious sexual codes, particularly
Catholic opposition to contraception in *Humanae Vitae* (1968), the
movement asserted individual conscience over institutional doctrine.

**Patriarchal Control**: Women's assertion of sexual autonomy challenged
male control over female sexuality and reproductive capacity,
undermining patriarchal family structures.

**Capitalist Morality**: The movement rejected bourgeois sexual morality
that served to maintain capitalist social relations through control of
reproduction and enforcement of nuclear family structures necessary for
property transmission.

## Anarchist Contributions

### Alex Comfort's *The Joy of Sex*

Anarchist scientist and poet
<a href="Alex_Comfort" class="wikilink" title="Alex Comfort">Alex
Comfort</a> made one of the most influential contributions to the sexual
revolution with *The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making* (1972).
Unlike clinical sex manuals, Comfort's book celebrated sexual pleasure,
experimentation, and mutual exploration between consenting partners.[^4]

Comfort approached sexuality from an explicitly anarchist perspective,
viewing sexual freedom as essential to human flourishing and opposing
all forms of sexual regulation by state or religious authorities. His
work emphasized:

- **Consensual Exploration**: Sexual activity as mutual pleasure and
  discovery rather than performance or duty
- **Individual Autonomy**: Each person's right to determine their own
  sexual expression
- **Anti-Authoritarianism**: Rejection of external control over intimate
  life
- **Pleasure Ethics**: Affirmation of pleasure as positive good rather
  than something requiring justification

*The Joy of Sex* became a bestseller and cultural phenomenon, making
anarchist ideas about sexual autonomy accessible to mainstream audiences
without necessarily identifying them as such.

### Other Anarchist Voices

Other anarchist and anarchist-influenced figures contributed to sexual
liberation discourse:

- **Paul Goodman**: Anarchist writer and social critic whose work on
  sexuality, particularly regarding homosexuality and youth sexuality,
  challenged conventional morality
- **Wilhelm Reich**: Though controversial, Reich's fusion of Freudian
  analysis with anarchist politics influenced counterculture
  understanding of sexual repression's role in maintaining authoritarian
  systems
- **Emma Goldman**: Earlier anarchist feminist whose advocacy for birth
  control, free love, and women's sexual autonomy provided historical
  foundation for 1960s-70s movements

## Anarcha-Feminist Perspectives

### Women's Liberation and Sexual Freedom

<a href="Anarcha-feminism" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcha-feminists">Anarcha-feminists</a> understood that sexual
liberation required more than just removing legal restrictions—it
demanded transforming power relations between genders. The movement
emphasized:

**Bodily Autonomy**: Women's absolute right to control their own bodies,
including decisions about sex, reproduction, and contraception without
state, religious, or male interference

**Challenging Objectification**: Critique of women's reduction to sexual
objects for male pleasure, demanding recognition of women's sexual
subjectivity and desire

**Reproductive Freedom**: Access to contraception and abortion as
essential to women's liberation, enabling sexual activity without
compulsory reproduction

**Pleasure Rights**: Recognition that women's sexual pleasure mattered
independently of reproduction or male satisfaction

Anne Koedt's *The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm* (1970) exemplified
anarcha-feminist analysis, challenging patriarchal sexuality that
centered male pleasure while ignoring women's actual sexual anatomy and
experience.[^5]

### Critiques and Debates

Some anarcha-feminists, particularly radical feminists, argued that the
sexual revolution primarily benefited men while exposing women to new
forms of exploitation. They contended that without transforming
underlying power relations, "sexual freedom" could mean freedom for men
to access women's bodies without commitment or responsibility.

These debates highlighted tensions between different liberation visions:

- Individual autonomy versus collective transformation
- Sexual expression versus sexual exploitation
- Pleasure liberation versus safety from harm

These discussions continue within anarchist and feminist movements,
reflecting ongoing struggles to envision sexuality freed from all
hierarchies.

## LGBT Liberation

### Queer Resistance to Authority

The <a href="LGBT" class="wikilink" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> liberation
movement formed a crucial component of the sexual revolution, directly
challenging state and religious control over sexuality. Homosexuality
remained criminalized in most jurisdictions through the 1960s, with LGBT
people facing arrest, psychiatric institutionalization, employment
discrimination, and violence.

The <a href="Stonewall_riots" class="wikilink"
title="Stonewall riots">Stonewall riots</a> of 1969 crystallized LGBT
resistance, transforming private survival strategies into public,
confrontational politics. This shift aligned with anarchist principles
of <a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> and rejection of respectability politics.

### Anarchist Elements

LGBT liberation exhibited anarchist characteristics:

**Anti-Statism**: Demanding decriminalization rather than state
protection, emphasizing autonomy rather than integration

**Direct Action**: Street resistance, confrontational tactics, and
creation of autonomous spaces rather than lobbying for permission

**Community Self-Organization**: Building mutual aid networks, safe
spaces, and cultural institutions independent of state support

**Challenge to All Hierarchy**: Recognizing connections between
heteronormativity, patriarchy, capitalism, and state power

The gay liberation movement's emphasis on "coming out" represented
personal refusal of authority's demand for concealment and shame—an
anarchist assertion that individuals need not hide who they are to
satisfy social controllers.

## Relationship to Free Love

The sexual revolution renewed and expanded 19th-century
<a href="free_love" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>
principles. Both movements shared core anarchist commitments:

- **Voluntary Association**: Relationships based on free choice rather
  than legal, economic, or social coercion
- **State Separation**: Removing government from intimate life and
  personal decisions
- **Individual Sovereignty**: Each person's right to determine their
  sexual and romantic relationships
- **Non-Coercion**: Rejection of forced monogamy, compulsory
  heterosexuality, or any imposed relationship structure

The 1960s-70s movement added:

- **Technologically-Enabled Freedom**: Birth control enabling sex
  without reproduction
- **Collective Experimentation**: Communes and intentional communities
  trying alternative relationship structures
- **Identity Politics**: Recognition of how gender and sexual identity
  intersected with liberation

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Commercialization

Critics noted that capitalism quickly commodified sexual liberation,
transforming rebellion into marketable products. Pornography, sexual
imagery in advertising, and sex industry expansion raised questions
about whether liberation had been achieved or merely repackaged for
profit.

From an anarchist perspective, this highlighted the need for economic
transformation alongside cultural change—sexual freedom under capitalism
remained constrained by market forces and commodification of bodies.

### Incomplete Revolution

Many anarchists argue the sexual revolution remained incomplete:

- **Persistent Patriarchy**: Male dominance in sexual relationships
  often continued despite formal equality
- **State Control**: Government still regulates marriage, prostitution,
  and many sexual practices
- **Heteronormativity**: LGBT people gained some acceptance but
  heterosexual norms remained dominant
- **Racial Hierarchy**: Sexual liberation movements were predominantly
  white, often ignoring how racism shaped sexual regulation
- **Class Division**: Access to contraception, abortion, and sexual
  healthcare remained economically stratified

### AIDS Crisis Impact

The AIDS crisis beginning in the 1980s forced reassessment of sexual
liberation. While some conservatives blamed sexual freedom for the
epidemic, anarchists and radicals identified the crisis as revealing
state failure and the power of community self-organization.

LGBT communities developed mutual aid networks providing care,
education, and political resistance when governments ignored or actively
harmed them. This exemplified anarchist principles of autonomous,
non-state solutions to social needs.

Free love's more assertive manifestations faced increased pushback as
public awareness of sexually transmitted disease grew, demonstrating how
fear could be mobilized to restrict freedom.

## Contemporary Relevance

The sexual revolution's anarchist dimensions remain relevant:

**Ongoing Struggles**: Battles over abortion access, sex work
decriminalization, transgender rights, and comprehensive sex education
continue fights against state and religious control over sexuality

**<a href="Relationship_Anarchy" class="wikilink"
title="Relationship Anarchy">Relationship Anarchy</a>**: Contemporary
movement explicitly applying anarchist principles to intimate
relationships, rejecting hierarchies and prescriptive structures

**Consent Culture**: Emphasis on enthusiastic, ongoing consent reflects
anarchist values of voluntary association and mutual respect

**Intersectionality**: Recognition that sexual liberation must address
race, class, disability, and other hierarchies alongside gender and
sexuality
