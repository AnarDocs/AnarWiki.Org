> One essentially anarchist revolution that has advanced enormously in
> our own day is the sexual revolution. It is anarchist precisely
> because it involves denying the authority of the regulations laid down
> by the state and by various religious enterprises over the activities
> of the individual. And we can claim that it has advanced, not because
> of the 'breakdown' of the family that moralists (quite erroneously)
> see all around them, but because in Western society more and more
> people have decided to conduct their sexual lives as they see best.
> Those who have prophesied dreadful consequences as a result of the
> greater sexual freedom which the young assert - unwanted babies,
> venereal disease and so on - are usually the very same people who seek
> the fulfilment of their prophesies by opposing the free availability
> to the young of contraception and the removal of the stigma and
> mystification that surround venereal disease.
