A result of symbiosis, sea slugs are animals capable of photosynthesis,
"actual plant-animal hybrids".[^1] The ancestor of the sea slugs ate
green algae. Instead of being digested, the algae entered the animal's
tissue, allowing the animal to acquire photosynthetic genes. Today,
adult sea slugs never eat. Instead, they crawl to the shore and sunbathe
like plants do. Whereas the ancestors were grey, sea slugs are
green.[^2] A 2015 study examined sea slug DNA and found it includes
genes from algae.[^3] While Peter Kropotkin's *Mutual Aid* explored the
cooperative interaction within species, symbiosis offers examples of
cooperative interaction between species. The sea slug emerged not from
competition or random mutations, but from a merger between an animal
species and a plant species.
