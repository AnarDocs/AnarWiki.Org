# Anarchist Ethics

**Anarchist ethics** represents a distinctive approach to
"<a   href="moral_philosophy.md" class="wikilink"
title="moral philosophy">moral philosophy</a> that centers on
anti-hierarchical principles and the rejection of imposed authority in
moral decision-making. Unlike religious or state-based moral systems,
anarchist ethics derives its foundations from observations of social
behavior, mutual aid, and the recognition that moral sentiment arises
naturally from social relationships rather than divine command or legal
statute.

## Overview

Anarchist ethics occupies a central position within
"<a   href="anarchist_theory.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist theory">anarchist theory</a> and practice,
distinguishing anarchism from other revolutionary traditions through its
emphasis on moral evaluation over purely economic analysis.[^1] The
tradition focuses particularly on micropolitical questions - the
everyday decisions and power relations of civil society - rather than
solely on macropolitical institutional change.[^2]

The ethical framework of anarchism is identifiable through core concepts
including anti-hierarchy, "<a   href="prefiguration.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefiguration">prefiguration</a> (means being in accordance with
ends), and a social conception of the self.[^3] These principles remain
stable across different anarchist tendencies, though their relative
priority varies between sub-ideologies such as
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchism">green
anarchism</a> or "<a   href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>.

## Historical Development

### Classical Foundations

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>'s work on ethics, particularly his unfinished *Ethics:
Origin and Development*, provided an early systematic treatment of
anarchist moral philosophy.[^4] Kropotkin rejected both religious
morality and abstract philosophical systems, instead grounding ethics in
the scientific observation of animal and human societies. He identified
the moral sentiment as arising from sympathy and solidarity - natural
features of social existence that long predate human civilization.[^5]

"<a   href="Adam_Smith.md" class="wikilink" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s
*The Theory of Moral Sentiment* influenced anarchist thinking despite
Smith's later association with capitalism. Smith identified sympathy as
the foundation of moral behavior - the capacity to imagine oneself in
another's position and to feel their suffering or joy.[^6] This
naturalistic explanation of morality, freed from religious doctrine,
provided a foundation for secular anarchist ethics.

### Twentieth Century Debates

The mid-twentieth century saw significant debates about the role of
ethics within anarchism. Writers like
"<a   href="Herbert_Read.md" class="wikilink" title="Herbert Read">Herbert
Read</a> in *The Philosophy of Anarchism* developed virtue-based
approaches emphasizing prefiguration and the rejection of universal
moral commandments.[^7] Meanwhile, tensions emerged between different
ethical orientations within the movement, including disagreements
between syndicalist-focused and communitarian approaches.[^8]

## Meta-Ethical Foundations

### Rejection of Universal Morality

Anarchist ethics generally rejects claims to universal, unchanging moral
principles discoverable through pure reason or divine revelation. This
rejection stems from several concerns:

The epistemological problems associated with claims to know "the greater
good" for others, which can justify colonialism and paternalism[^9]

The recognition that different social practices generate different
combinations of virtues and values[^10]

The observation that moral conceptions change according to historical
circumstances and available knowledge[^11]

The critique of how ruling classes weaponize supposedly universal
principles to maintain their privileges[^12]

### Natural Origins of Morality

Anarchist thinkers have consistently argued that moral sentiment arises
from natural social life rather than supernatural sources. Kropotkin
observed that social animals, from ants to birds to mammals, demonstrate
clear conceptions of beneficial and harmful behavior toward their
communities.[^13] This suggests that morality is "a natural faculty in
us like the sense of smell or of touch" rather than a divine gift or
rational construction.[^14]

The principle underlying this natural morality can be summarized as:
treat others as you would wish to be treated under similar
circumstances.[^15] This emerges not from abstract reasoning but from
the practical necessities of social existence. Species that develop
strong practices of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and solidarity prove more successful in survival and flourishing than
those dominated by purely competitive relations.[^16]

### The Role of Sympathy

Following Adam Smith, anarchist ethics recognizes sympathy - the
capacity to imagine and feel another's experience - as fundamental to
moral behavior.[^17] When we witness suffering, our imagination causes
us to experience that suffering ourselves, generating a powerful
motivation to prevent or alleviate it. The more developed one's
sympathetic imagination, the more refined and extensive one's moral
sensibility becomes.

This understanding dissolves the supposed mystery of altruism. The
person who shares their last piece of bread with a hungry stranger acts
not from abstract duty but because they find greater satisfaction in
sharing than in eating alone while another suffers.[^18] Both selfish
and generous acts spring from the same source - the pursuit of what
brings satisfaction and the avoidance of what causes distress.

## Normative Approaches

### Practice-Based Virtue Ethics

Many anarchist theorists, particularly those in the social anarchist
tradition, align with a practice-based virtue ethics derived from
Aristotelian philosophy and developed by thinkers like
"<a   href="Alasdair_MacIntyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alasdair MacIntyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>.[^19] This approach
views virtues not as abstract ideals but as qualities embedded in and
arising from social practices.

**Virtues** are character traits and relational qualities that are good
both intrinsically and for their consequences. Key anarchist virtues
include:

- **Courage** - standing up to bullies and hierarchical power[^20]
- **Compassion** - equalizing resources rather than hoarding them[^21]
- **Justice** - treating others fairly without exploitation
- **Wisdom** - understanding situations and acting appropriately[^22]
- **Solidarity** - recognizing common interests and mutual
  dependence[^23]
- **Wit** - building community, mocking the powerful, enabling
  self-criticism[^24]

Each virtue exists between corresponding vices. Generosity, for
instance, occupies the middle ground between miserliness and wasteful
profligacy.[^25] Virtues work in unity - true courage requires wisdom
and compassion, otherwise it degenerates into rashness or
brutality.[^26]

**Practices** are rule-governed social activities that generate both
internal and external goods.[^27] Internal goods are valuable in
themselves - friendship, compassion, wisdom - rather than for future
benefits they might produce. Practices that successfully cultivate
virtues tend to be resilient and sustainable across time and geography,
forming traditions of cooperative activity.

This approach aligns with anarchism's emphasis on
"<a   href="prefiguration.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefiguration">prefiguration</a> - the principle that means must
embody the ends sought.[^28] Political activities should generate
immediate shared goods and virtuous relations, not merely serve as
instruments toward a distant goal. When practices are corrupted by
imposing external goals (such as profit maximization in competitive
cycling), the virtues embedded in those practices deteriorate.[^29]

### Consequentialism and Its Limits

Some anarchist rhetoric employs consequentialist arguments, particularly
during revolutionary periods. Slogans like "by any means necessary"
express the intensity of desire for radical social improvement and the
belief that current conditions are intolerable.[^30]

Consequentialist thinking offers certain attractions for anarchism:

- Concern with producing beneficial social outcomes rather than
  individual advantage[^31]
- Egalitarian consideration of all affected parties[^32]
- Accessible, secular basis for moral evaluation[^33]
- Recognition that meaningful action requires goals[^34]

However, anarchists have identified serious problems with pure
consequentialism:

**Incompatibility with equality** - Classical utilitarianism may justify
maintaining inequalities if doing so maximizes aggregate happiness[^35]

**Epistemological hubris** - Claims to know what will produce the
greatest good can justify vanguardism and paternalism[^36]

**Corruption of practices** - Reducing diverse social goods to a single
metric of utility degrades the internal richness of different
activities[^37]

**Neglect of agency** - Treating people as mere objects to be optimized
for outcomes rather than active participants in social change[^38]

**Insufficient attention to means** - The separation of means and ends
enables authoritarian methods in pursuit of liberatory goals[^39]

The historical experience of Leninist parties illustrated this last
danger - building an authoritarian revolutionary organization as the
means to liberation resulted in the organization itself becoming the
goal, producing tyranny rather than freedom.[^40]

### Deontology and Rights

Some anarchists, particularly during the Cold War period, incorporated
liberal rights-based language into their ethics. Thinkers like
"<a   href="Giovanni_Baldelli.md" class="wikilink"
title="Giovanni Baldelli">Giovanni Baldelli</a> and
"<a   href="David_Wieck.md" class="wikilink" title="David Wieck">David
Wieck</a> emphasized individual autonomy and freedom from coercion
alongside egalitarian principles.[^41]

This approach shares with anarchism:

- Respect for individual dignity and agency
- Opposition to arbitrary interference with persons
- Recognition of the importance of active participation in life

However, when rights-based thinking becomes dominant, particularly in
its propertarian forms, it conflicts with anarchist principles:

**Support for inequality** - Absolute property rights generate and
maintain vast disparities in wealth and power[^42]

**Inadequate conception of freedom** - Negative freedom alone ignores
how poverty and lack of resources constrain genuine liberty[^43]

**Flawed view of the individual** - Liberal individualism abstracts
persons from their social relationships and shared practices[^44]

**Reduction of relationships to contracts** - Treating all human
interactions as transactions corrodes virtues like friendship and
solidarity[^45]

**Requirement for enforcement** - Property rights require hierarchical
institutions (state or private) to maintain them through violence[^46]

The propertarian "anarcho-capitalism" that developed from extreme
classical liberalism is rejected by social anarchists as fundamentally
incompatible with anarchist opposition to hierarchy and domination.[^47]

### Egoism and Post-Left Critiques

Drawing on
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">Max
Stirner</a>'s philosophy, some anarchists advocate ethical egoism - the
view that individuals should pursue their own interests without regard
for universal moral principles.[^48] Post-left anarchists like
"<a   href="Bob_Black.md" class="wikilink" title="Bob Black">Bob Black</a>
have criticized what they view as moralistic puritanism within
anarchism.[^49]

These critics reject:

- The epistemological foundations of supposedly universal values[^50]
- The manipulation of moral language by those seeking power[^51]
- Ascetic moralism that denies pleasure and desire

However, even critics of "moralism" typically rely on ethical evaluation
in practice, praising honesty, condemning dishonesty, and valuing
friendship.[^52] The real disagreement concerns universality rather than
ethics as such.

Practice-based anarchist ethics accommodates these concerns by:

- Rejecting universal principles discoverable through abstract
  reason[^53]
- Recognizing that values exist within and arise from social practices
- Acknowledging that moral conceptions change and develop
  historically[^54]
- Avoiding the paternalistic imposition of a single moral vision

The key difference is that practice-based approaches recognize values as
social facts - embedded in actual human activities - rather than purely
subjective preferences dependent on individual consciousness alone.[^55]

## Applied Ethics

### Freedom of Speech and No Platform

Anarchist ethics provides resources for addressing contentious questions
like whether to deny platforms to
"<a   href="fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="fascists">fascists</a> and
bigots.[^56] Rather than applying a single universal principle, a
practice-based approach recognizes that different contexts require
different norms.

In a university political theory seminar, robust discussion of
controversial viewpoints serves the internal goods of that practice -
developing analytical skills, evaluating arguments, understanding
political ideologies. In a horticulture class, racist expressions only
disrupt learning and undermine the virtues of wisdom and justice. At a
public assembly, organized fascists may need to be prevented from
speaking to protect the goods-rich practices of community
self-organization.[^57]

The key is that practitioners and those in adjacent (affected) practices
are best positioned to determine appropriate norms, not external
authorities imposing abstract principles.

### Violence and Revolution

Anarchist ethics confronts difficult questions about the use of force:

**Pacifist anarchists** argue that violent revolution contradicts
anarchist principles by imposing solutions through force. Revolutionary
change requires educational transformation over generations, building
non-authoritarian relations from the ground up.[^58]

**Revolutionary anarchists** counter that:

- Violence may be necessary to defend communities and practices against
  violent oppression[^59]
- Passive resistance has limited effectiveness against ruthless
  opponents[^60]
- Ruling classes will not relinquish power voluntarily
- Militant resistance demonstrates courage and commitment to justice

The distinction between fighting to preserve virtuous practices and
fighting for domination proves crucial. As Kropotkin noted, people
recognize the legitimacy of force exercised by those who have "conquered
the right" through demonstrated commitment to liberation rather than
personal gain.[^61]

### Everyday Moral Life

Most moral action occurs habitually rather than through conscious
deliberation.[^62] Through practice in social relationships, treating
others with respect and solidarity becomes ingrained. Only in unusual
circumstances do people consciously invoke moral principles.

This habitual dimension explains both the resilience and the
conservatism of moral sentiment.[^63] Established patterns of behavior
perpetuate themselves, but they also provide stability that allows
social cooperation. Changing moral habits requires changing the
practices and relationships that generate them.

## Relationship to Other Traditions

### Distinction from Marxism

While both traditions seek radical social transformation, anarchist
ethics differs from orthodox Marxism in several ways:

- Greater emphasis on moral evaluation over economic determinism[^64]
- Focus on micropolitical relations rather than exclusively
  macropolitical change[^65]
- Rejection of vanguardism and claims to scientific knowledge of
  historical inevitability[^66]
- Insistence on prefigurative politics rather than ends justifying
  means[^67]

### Distinction from Liberalism

Anarchist ethics overlaps with liberal concern for individual liberty
but diverges significantly:

- Social rather than atomistic conception of individuals[^68]
- Positive as well as negative freedom[^69]
- Rejection of property rights that enable exploitation[^70]
- Critique of reducing all relationships to contracts[^71]
- Opposition to state institutions that enforce liberal rights

### Contemporary Relevance

Modern anarchist practice continues to generate ethical insights:

- "<a   href="Horizontalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Horizontal organization">Horizontal organization</a> embodies
  egalitarian values in immediate relationships[^72]
- "<a   href="Mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">Mutual aid</a>
  initiatives create solidarity rather than charity
- "<a   href="Direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="Direct action">Direct
  action</a> enables moral agency rather than petitioning authorities
- "<a   href="Prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Prefigurative politics">Prefigurative politics</a> makes
  ethical living possible now rather than deferred to the future[^73]

## Critiques and Challenges

Anarchist ethics faces several ongoing challenges:

**Practical application** - How to maintain ethical consistency in an
unethical society without becoming ineffective or sectarian[^74]

**Moral disagreement** - Resolving conflicts when participants in
practices have genuinely different values

**Social change** - Balancing patience for gradual ethical development
against urgency of addressing immediate oppression[^75]

**Individual versus collective** - Determining when individual freedom
should yield to community needs and when community demands become
oppressive[^76]

## Conclusion

Anarchist ethics offers a distinctive approach to moral philosophy
grounded in observation of social life, emphasizing anti-hierarchical
virtues, and rejecting imposed authority. Rather than commanding
obedience to abstract principles, it describes the natural emergence of
moral sentiment from sympathetic social relationships and identifies the
virtues that enable practices to flourish.

The goal is not to create morally perfect individuals but to foster
social conditions in which people can develop their capacities fully
through voluntary cooperation, where courage, compassion, wisdom, and
solidarity become habitual features of everyday life.[^77] As Kropotkin
concluded: "Be strong. Overflow with emotional and intellectual energy,
and you will spread your intelligence, your love, your energy of action
broadcast among others!"[^78]
