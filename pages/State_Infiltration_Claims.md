# FBI/CIA Infiltration Claims: Anarchism vs. Leninism

## Overview

A recurring accusation from some Leninist circles claims that American
anarchism has been infiltrated or influenced by the CIA. However,
examination of historical evidence reveals a more complex picture: while
the FBI created limited propaganda materials invoking anarchist themes,
Leninist organizations—particularly the Communist Party USA
(CPUSA)—faced massive, systematic, and well-documented infiltration that
compromised their entire organizational structure.

## The "Workshop" Zine

### What Actually Happened

In the late 1960s, FBI agents working on
<a href="COINTELPRO" class="wikilink" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>
brainstormed creating a fake anarchist underground newspaper called "The
Workshop." Internal FBI documents stated that "the anarchist point of
view is the most disruptive element in the New Left and should be
capitalized on in the most confusing ways."

### Critical Context Often Omitted

When Leninists cite this as evidence of CIA/FBI infiltration of
anarchism, they typically omit several crucial facts:

**Brainstorming vs. Implementation**: The "Workshop" proposal was a
planning document between FBI agents workshopping ideas—not official FBI
policy or a successfully executed operation.

**The FBI Changed Course**: The FBI actually created multiple fake
underground newspapers with different ideological orientations:

- **Armageddon News** (1968): Used to attack the anti-Vietnam War
  movement
- **Chevara News**: A Maoist, pro-Che Guevara, staunchly anti-Soviet
  publication that praised Castro and Mao
- **The Rational Observer**: Chevara News later transformed into a
  right-wing, Ayn Rand-adoring objectivist publication
- **The Longhorn Tale**: Distributed at University of Texas at Austin to
  dox SDS activists
- **Ad Hoc Bulletin**: Published by the FBI-created "Ad Hoc Committee
  for a Marxist-Leninist Party," a fake Maoist faction

**No Evidence of Success**: There is no documented evidence that "The
Workshop" was ever actually published or that the proposed anarchist
infiltration strategy was successful.

**FBI ≠ CIA**: The FBI and CIA are different organizations with
different mandates. The FBI conducted domestic operations like
COINTELPRO, while the CIA focused on foreign intelligence.

### What the Documents Actually Show

The FBI recognized that anarchist rhetoric could be weaponized to attack
various targets because "the anarchist position could take any
direction, such as an attack on Vietnam policies as well as an attack on
the Soviets in Czechoslovakia." This shows the FBI saw anarchist talking
points as useful propaganda tools—not that they successfully infiltrated
anarchist organizations.

The FBI also noted that anarchist-themed content would "reach wider
circulation if it were not so political as to be tied to dogma such as
the line of MAO or CHE GUEVARA," showing their intent to depoliticize
left struggle through cultural distractions ("underground cinema, music,
sex, dope, humor").

## Evidence of Massive FBI Infiltration of Leninist Organizations

In stark contrast to speculative claims about anarchism, the
infiltration of American Leninist organizations is extensively
documented.

### Communist Party USA (CPUSA)

**Systematic Penetration**:

By 1957, CPUSA membership had declined to less than 10,000, of whom
approximately 1,500 were FBI informants (roughly 15% of total
membership).[^1] By the 1960s, the FBI had recruited an estimated 5-10%
of CPUSA membership to provide intelligence on meetings, finances,
literature, and organizing. A standing Cold War joke was that "without
the dues paid to the Communist Party USA by FBI informants, the Party
would go bankrupt."

**Operation SOLO**:

Morris Childs, a top CPUSA official, worked as an FBI informant from
1952-1982. He made 52 secret trips to Moscow as the party's liaison to
the Soviet Communist Party, helped transfer over \$28 million from the
Soviet Union to CPUSA while reporting everything to the FBI. This was
one of the FBI's most successful intelligence operations, providing
unprecedented insight into both CPUSA and international communist
affairs.

**FBI-Created Organizations**:

The Ad Hoc Committee for a Marxist-Leninist Party (initially the Ad Hoc
Committee for a Scientific Socialist Line) was entirely an FBI creation
beginning in 1962.[^2] It posed as a secret Maoist faction within CPUSA
opposed to Khrushchev's "revisionism," published Ad Hoc Bulletin as a
fake Maoist newsletter. The operation remained secret until researcher
Aaron Leonard uncovered it decades later in his 2015 book Heavy
Radicals.

**Informants Recruiting Informants**:

FBI infiltration was so extensive that informants often ended up
recruiting other FBI informants who were unknown to each other. This was
particularly common in small ultra-left Maoist groups that emerged in
the 1960s-70s.

### COINTELPRO's Broader Impact

**Primary Target**: COINTELPRO began in 1956 specifically to disrupt the
Communist Party USA, then expanded to target:

- Socialist Workers Party (1961)
- Black Panther Party (1967)
- Various New Left organizations (1968)
- Civil rights organizations, including Martin Luther King Jr. and the
  Southern Christian Leadership Conference

**Scale of Operations**:

Nearly 1 million intelligence investigations were opened on Americans
during the COINTELPRO era (1956-1971).[^3] The FBI placed more than
50,000 human informers or infiltrators inside political groups. Tactics
included illegal wiretaps, mail opening, IRS audits, forged documents,
anonymous letters, and direct violence.

**Documented Success**: COINTELPRO achieved remarkable success against
hierarchical left organizations precisely because infiltrating the
leadership provided access to everything—membership lists, financial
records, strategic plans, and internal communications.

### Why Hierarchical Organizations Were Easier to Infiltrate

Leninist parties had:

- Formal membership lists with names and contact information
- Centralized leadership structures where compromising key figures gave
  access to entire organizations
- Regular dues collection creating financial paper trails
- Official meeting minutes and records
- Hierarchical decision-making that could be monitored and disrupted
  from within
- Democratic centralism that, once infiltrated, allowed informants to
  influence entire organizations
- Soviet funding that required courier operations (like Operation SOLO)
  that could be monitored

## Why Anarchists Are Harder to Infiltrate

### Government Acknowledgment

A 2011 Homeland Security document titled "Anarchist Extremism: A
Research Note" explicitly states:

"Intelligence gathering among the most radical—and often most
violent—factions is particularly difficult. Infiltration into large
affinity group meetings is relatively simple. However, infiltration into
radical revolutionary 'cells' is not. The very nature of the movement's
suspicion and operational security enhancements makes infiltration
difficult and time consuming. Few agencies are able to commit to
operations that require years of up-front work just getting into a
'cell,' especially given shrinking budgets and increased demands for
attention to other issues. Infiltration is made more difficult by the
communal nature of the lifestyle (under constant observation and
scrutiny) and the extensive knowledge held by many anarchists, which
require a considerable amount of study and time to acquire."[^4]

### Structural Factors

Anarchist organizing makes infiltration more difficult because:

- No formal membership lists to steal or subpoena
- Decentralized networks rather than centralized command structures
- No central leadership to compromise or co-opt
- Affinity group model where trust is built through personal
  relationships and shared action
- Security culture that emphasizes operational security and skepticism
  of newcomers
- No dues or formal financing structures to track
- Autonomous decision-making prevents single infiltrators from
  controlling or directing action
- Extensive political knowledge required to participate authentically in
  anarchist spaces
- Communal living situations where infiltrators face constant scrutiny

### Important Caveats

This does not mean anarchism is immune to infiltration. Large public
meetings and protests are relatively easy to monitor, individual
anarchists can be pressured or co-opted, and infiltration is absolutely
possible with sufficient resources and time commitment. Every leftist
tendency has been infiltrated at various points. The advantage is that
infiltrating one cell or network doesn't compromise the entire movement.

## Historical Context: Pre-CIA Anarchist Repression

Anarchists were heavily repressed by the U.S. government long before the
CIA was created in 1947:

- **Palmer Raids** (1919-1920): Specifically targeted anarchists; Emma
  Goldman and Alexander Berkman were deported
- **Haymarket Affair** (1886): Eight anarchists convicted (four
  executed) after a bombing at a labor rally in Chicago
- **Sacco and Vanzetti** (1920-1927): Two Italian anarchists executed in
  a controversial case that became internationally notorious
- **Early FBI/BOI surveillance**: J. Edgar Hoover's career began
  tracking anarchists and leftists during the First Red Scare

The government demonstrated sustained concern about anarchism as a
political threat decades before the Cold War.

## INTERPOL and International Collaboration

<a href="INTERPOL" class="wikilink" title="INTERPOL">INTERPOL</a>
(International Criminal Police Organization) was established in 1923
through collaboration between both capitalist and so-called "socialist"
states, with anarchists as a primary target. This international
cooperation to surveil and suppress anarchist movements predates both
the Cold War and the CIA, demonstrating long-standing state concern
about anarchist organizing across different political systems.

## Why the Accusation Persists

### Projection

The accusation that anarchism is "CIA-infiltrated" may function as
psychological projection—attributing to others what is true of oneself.
Leninist organizations experienced massive documented infiltration, have
hierarchical structures that proved vulnerable, and faced organizational
collapse partially due to FBI operations. By accusing anarchists of
infiltration, Leninists may be deflecting attention from their own
demonstrated vulnerabilities.

### Rhetorical Function

The claim serves to:

- Dismiss anarchist critiques without engaging with their substance
- Question anarchist authenticity rather than debating political
  positions
- Avoid uncomfortable historical facts about ML states' suppression of
  anarchists
- Create in-group/out-group dynamics within the left

### The Irony

MLs accuse anarchists of CIA infiltration while 15% of CPUSA in 1957
were FBI informants, the FBI created entire fake Maoist organizations,
top CPUSA officials were FBI assets for decades, and FBI infiltration
was so thorough that informants recruited other informants. Meanwhile,
evidence of successful anarchist infiltration remains largely
speculative and based on a brainstorming document about a propaganda
project that apparently never materialized as proposed.

## Comparative Analysis

| Factor | Anarchist Organizations | Leninist Organizations (CPUSA) |
|----|----|----|
| **Documented FBI Infiltration** | Limited propaganda efforts; hard to infiltrate cells | 5-15% of membership were informants by 1950s-60s |
| **FBI-Created Organizations** | None documented | Ad Hoc Committee for Marxist-Leninist Party |
| **Top Leadership Compromised** | No documented cases | Morris Childs (Operation SOLO, 1952-1982) |
| **Organizational Structure** | Decentralized, no membership lists | Hierarchical, formal membership |
| **Ease of Infiltration** | DHS admits it's "difficult and time consuming" | Extensively penetrated at all levels |
| **COINTELPRO Impact** | Monitored but structurally resistant | Primary target; systematically disrupted |
| **Evidence Type** | Planning documents, limited implementation | Decades of FBI files, congressional investigations |

## Analysis

The claim that American anarchism has been infiltrated by the CIA/FBI
relies primarily on a single set of FBI planning documents proposing an
anarchist-themed propaganda newspaper, evidence that the FBI recognized
anarchist rhetoric could be weaponized, and speculation rather than
documented infiltration.

Meanwhile, evidence of FBI infiltration of American Leninist
organizations includes 15% of CPUSA membership were FBI informants by
1957, top leadership worked as FBI assets for 30+ years (Operation
SOLO), entire organizations created by the FBI to infiltrate and disrupt
the left, congressional investigations documenting systematic
penetration, and tens of thousands of pages of FBI documents released
through FOIA.

The structural differences between hierarchical Leninist parties and
decentralized anarchist networks explain why one was more vulnerable to
infiltration than the other. Government documents explicitly acknowledge
the difficulty of infiltrating anarchist cells due to their security
culture, political knowledge requirements, and lack of centralized
structure.

While no leftist tendency is immune to state repression or infiltration,
the historical record shows that American Leninism — not anarchism —
bore the brunt of successful FBI penetration during the Cold War era.
