## Overview

Michael Albert and Robin Hanhel's theory of Participatory Economics
(parecon) and Stephen Shalom's theory of Participatory Polity propose
complementary visions for a Participatory Society. They and other
scholars have collaborated and elaborated on this vision in a number of
works, often on the website *ZNet*.

## Culture

The Participatory Society would aims for "an end to systematic violation
of women, gays, children, and the elderly."[^1] Moving beyond the norm
of the patriarchal family, parents would evenly share parenting labor
and people would live in a variety of individual and collective living
arrangements according to their preferences. People of all ages could
engage in consensual sex without stigma.[^2]

The Participatory Society would value cultural diversity and local
autonomy, with communities federating into intercommunal networks that
seek to abolish hierarchies based on religion, and ethnicity, and
"race."[^3]

## Decisions

In Participatory Polity, *nested councils* make decisions, striving for
consensus and resorting to majority vote when consensus is not reached.
From the the local councils upward, councils send immediately
recallable, rotating delegates to coordinate affairs among regions.
Delegates are not mandated to vote for the position favored by their
council, since such an arrangement would prevent them from reaching a
more informed decision based on deliberation with members from other
councils. The higher councils only vote on relatively non-controversial
matters. When there is a close vote, or when enough lower councils
demand it, matters are returned to the lower councils for a vote. Each
council above the local level has a *council court*, made of
randomly-selected, rotating citizens, who overrule decisions they deem
in violation of the rights of minorities.[^4]

## Economy

In **"<a   href="Participatory_Economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="Participatory Economics">Participatory Economics</a>** (Parecon),
*workers' councils* and *consumers' councils* would coordinate with each
other in order to optimally allocate materials to workplaces and goods
to consumers. Workers' councils would ensure that each worker has an
interesting variety of tasks and rotation between workplaces, called a
*balanced job complex*. Workers would be remunerated based on their
effort and sacrifice.[^5]

### Institutional Structure

The economic system of participatory economics is built around several
key institutions that seek to replace both market mechanisms and
"<a   href="central_planning.md" class="wikilink"
title="central planning">central planning</a>. The primary institutions
include workers' councils, consumers' councils,
"<a   href="balanced_job_complexes.md" class="wikilink"
title="balanced job complexes">balanced job complexes</a>, and
participatory planning processes coordinated through iteration
facilitation boards.

### Workers' and Consumers' Councils

**Workers' councils** would be democratically self-managed workplace
organizations where all workers participate in decision-making
processes. These councils would operate according to principles of
"<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>, with
decisions made through consensus-seeking processes or, when necessary,
majority voting. The councils would be responsible for organizing
production, determining work assignments, and coordinating with other
economic actors.

**Consumers' councils** would similarly organize consumers at
neighborhood, regional, and national levels to express their consumption
preferences and needs. These councils would engage in the planning
process by submitting consumption requests and negotiating with
producers about what goods and services should be produced.

### Balanced Job Complexes

A fundamental innovation of parecon is the concept of **balanced job
complexes**. Rather than having traditional job specialization that
concentrates empowering and creative tasks among a
"<a   href="coordinator_class.md" class="wikilink"
title="coordinator class">coordinator class</a> while relegating others
to routine labor, parecon proposes that each worker's job should include
a balanced mix of empowering and routine tasks. This ensures that all
workers develop their capacities and participate meaningfully in
workplace decision-making, preventing the formation of a new ruling
class based on monopolization of empowering skills.

### Remuneration Based on Effort and Sacrifice

Parecon rejects compensation systems based on
"<a   href="productivity.md" class="wikilink"
title="productivity">productivity</a>,
"<a   href="property_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="property ownership">property ownership</a>, or
"<a   href="bargaining_power.md" class="wikilink"
title="bargaining power">bargaining power</a>. Instead, it proposes
remuneration based on **effort and sacrifice** as judged by workplace
peers. This principle aims to reward workers for their dedication and
the difficulty of their work while ensuring that compensation is not
based on factors beyond individual control such as natural talents or
inherited advantages.

The system would start with an equal baseline income for all workers,
with variations based on the level of effort expended and the sacrifice
involved in particular work assignments. Workers who choose more
demanding, dangerous, or unpleasant tasks would receive higher
compensation, while those who prefer easier work would receive
correspondingly less.

### Participatory Planning Process

Rather than relying on market mechanisms or central planning, parecon
proposes a **participatory planning** process involving iterative
negotiations between workers' councils and consumers' councils. This
process would involve multiple rounds of proposals and
counter-proposals, facilitated by **Iteration Facilitation Boards**
(IFBs) that provide information about costs, availability, and economic
projections without having decision-making authority.

The planning process would work through successive approximations toward
an optimal allocation of resources, with prices serving as indicators of
"<a   href="social_opportunity_costs.md" class="wikilink"
title="social opportunity costs">social opportunity costs</a> rather
than market-determined values. The IFBs would use computer algorithms to
process information and suggest price adjustments based on supply and
demand imbalances revealed through the planning rounds.

### Efficiency and Innovation

Parecon advocates argue that their system would achieve greater
efficiency than both capitalist markets and central planning. Unlike
markets, which fail to account for
"<a   href="externalities.md" class="wikilink"
title="externalities">externalities</a> and
"<a   href="public_goods.md" class="wikilink" title="public goods">public
goods</a>, participatory planning would internalize all social costs and
benefits. Unlike central planning, the system would maintain incentive
compatibility by ensuring that economic actors have reasons to reveal
their true preferences and capabilities.

The system would also promote innovation differently than
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.
Rather than relying on
"<a   href="patent_rights.md" class="wikilink" title="patent rights">patent
rights</a> and "<a   href="intellectual_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="intellectual property">intellectual property</a> to reward
innovators, parecon would make all innovations immediately available to
all enterprises, ensuring maximum
"<a   href="static_efficiency.md" class="wikilink"
title="static efficiency">static efficiency</a>. Innovation would be
encouraged through the recognition and enhanced status that comes from
contributing to social welfare, rather than through
"<a   href="monopoly.md" class="wikilink" title="monopoly">monopoly</a>
profits.

### Resource Allocation and Environmental Sustainability

The participatory planning process would be particularly well-suited to
addressing environmental concerns and promoting
"<a   href="sustainability.md" class="wikilink"
title="sustainability">sustainability</a>. Since all environmental costs
would be internalized in the planning process, rather than treated as
"<a   href="externalities.md" class="wikilink"
title="externalities">externalities</a> as in market systems, the
economy would have built-in incentives for
"<a   href="ecological.md" class="wikilink" title="ecological">ecological</a>
decision-making.

The system would eliminate the "<a   href="accumulation.md" class="wikilink"
title="accumulation">accumulation</a> drive that characterizes
capitalism, replacing it with a focus on meeting human needs while
respecting
"<a   href="ecological.md" class="wikilink" title="ecological">ecological</a>
limits. Decisions about resource use would be made democratically with
full consideration of environmental impacts, rather than being driven by
"<a   href="profit.md" class="wikilink" title="profit">profit</a>
maximization.

## Education

Parecon theorists do not agree on specific pedagogical methods, but
Michael Albert elaborates on the general goals of education in parecon:

> Students should be assisted to discover their capacities and
> potentials, explore them, and fulfill them, while simultaneously
> becoming broadly confident and able to think, reason, argue, and
> assess in ways needed to function effectively among socially aware and
> caring adults.[^6]

## Environment

A variety of mechanisms in Parecon would allow people to structure an
ecological society if they desired one. Michael Albert explains:

> In sum then, parecon removes capitalism’s accumulation drive for
> corporate profit which compels behavior that hurts and even decimates
> other species. It puts in its place a concern for human well-being and
> development that doesn’t forcefully a priori preclude harming other
> species, but which is receptive to and respectful of governmental or
> other social or ecological restraints on behalf of other species. If
> other species had votes, in other words, they would vote for
> parecon.[^7]

## Crime

The Participatory Society would aim first and foremost to get rid of the
poverty and alienation that drive people to engage in anti-social
activities. Albert writes:

> So, in a parecon, equitable social roles and the socially generated
> values of solidarity and self-management, plus stable and just
> conditions, all make it unnecessary for people to try to enhance their
> lives through crime. To deter crime rooted in pathology, or to deal
> with social violations stemming from jealousy or other persistent
> phenomena, a good society would of course want to have fair
> adjudication and sensible practices that continually reduce, rather
> than aggravate, the probability of further violations.[^8]

Michael Albert and Stephen Shalom argue that there a Participatory
Society still be some limited police force and that this force will
operate according to the Parecon structure and be accountable to the
participatory political system.[^9]

## Revolution

Albert proposes the formation within capitalist society of workers'
councils, consumers' councils, and aligned radical organizations that
would collaboratively wage "non-reformist struggles." In such struggles,
people fight for short-term gains while educating people about the
larger vision of a radically transforming society.[^10] He elaborates:

> There will be pareconist efforts to win immediate reforms, and then
> more reforms, and still more reforms, but all these efforts will not
> only continually respect the limits and contexts of current
> conditions, but also self-consciously lead toward future revolutionary
> goals.[^11]

## Criticism

Anarcho-communist critics argue that participatory economics retains
problematic elements of "<a   href="commodity_production.md" class="wikilink"
title="commodity production">commodity production</a> and exchange that
should be abolished entirely. Many
"<a   href="Anarcho-Communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a> advocate for a
"<a   href="Gift_Economy.md" class="wikilink" title="Gift Economy">Gift
Economy</a> based on the principle
""<a   href="from_each_according_to_ability,_to_each_according_to_need.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to ability, to each according to need">from
each according to ability, to each according to need</a>" rather than
Parecon's system of effort-based compensation and formal planning
processes. They contend that Parecon's emphasis on measuring effort and
sacrifice, along with its complex bureaucratic planning apparatus
involving iteration facilitation boards and detailed consumption
proposals, recreates hierarchical structures and administrative burdens
that anarcho-communism seeks to eliminate. Critics argue that truly free
societies should move beyond any form of economic calculation or formal
exchange, instead relying on voluntary
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual Aid">Mutual Aid</a>
and spontaneous cooperation. They view Parecon's institutional
complexity as potentially stifling to human freedom and creativity,
preferring more organic forms of social organization that emerge
naturally from "<a   href="free_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a> rather than predetermined
economic structures.
