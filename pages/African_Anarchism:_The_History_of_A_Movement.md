# African Anarchism

## Overview

**African Anarchism** is a book authored by I.E. Igariwey and Sam Mbah,
published in 2001 by
<a href="See_Sharp_Press.md" class="wikilink" title="See Sharp Press">See
Sharp Press</a>. The publisher, Chaz Bufe, notes in the foreword that
while the initial title suggested a history, the book is more accurately
a "forward-looking book concerned with achieving positive social
change," with a more fitting title being "African Anarchism: Prospects
for the Future".

The work explores the potential for
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> in
Africa by examining traditional African societies, critiquing
post-colonial African socialism, and proposing anarchistic solutions for
the continent's future development.

## Summary

### Author's Intent

The authors, as members of the
<a href="Awareness_League.md" class="wikilink"
title="Awareness League">Awareness League</a>, were compelled to write
this book to enrich anarchism with an African perspective and to carve
out a place for Africa within the framework of the worldwide anarchist
movement, especially given "the collapse of the authoritarian left".
They highlight the opportunities for anarchism and analyse the concrete
challenges ahead.

The authors state in their preface that anarchist literature is
particularly scarce in Africa, which partly explains why anarchist ideas
have not spread as fast as they should.

### Structure and Content

The book is structured into seven chapters:

**Chapter 1: What Is Anarchism?** - This chapter defines
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> as
a social philosophy and movement, explaining that it arises from the
objective conditions of workers and producers, advocating for the
complete abolition of the state system and
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.
It differentiates anarchism from common misconceptions, clarifying that
it is basically opposed to violence, disorder, chaos, and terrorism, and
does not imply the absence of organization but rather advocates for
horizontal, decentralised, and democratic structures. It traces the
origins of <a href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>, noting that
anarchist principles date back to ancient times with thinkers like Zeno
and later
<a href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">William
Godwin</a> and <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>.
<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> are highlighted as key figures who elaborated on anarchist
goals and practical philosophy.

**Chapter 2: Anarchism In History** - This chapter explores the
contentious relationship between anarchism and related social movements,
including <a href="Marxist_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist socialism">Marxist socialism</a>,
<a href="syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, and
<a href="guild_socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="guild socialism">guild
socialism</a>, despite their shared goal of abolishing capitalism and
reconstructing society. It details the fundamental differences that led
to the rift between
<a href="Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Marx">Marx</a> and
<a href="Bakunin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> within
the <a href="First_International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md"
class="wikilink"
title="First International Workingmen&#39;s Association">First
International Workingmen's Association</a>, particularly concerning the
role of the state.

**Chapter 3: Anarchistic Precedents in Africa** - This section
investigates the presence of "anarchic elements" in traditional
(pre-colonial) African societies, asserting that while anarchism as an
ideology is new to Africa, it is not new as a way of life. It describes
African communalism, characterised by the absence of classes,
exploitative social relations, and hierarchical governmental
apparatuses, with decision-making often by consensus. Case studies of
stateless societies like the
<a href="Igbo.md" class="wikilink" title="Igbo">Igbo</a>, Niger Delta
Peoples, and Tallensi are provided to illustrate these features. It
examines the impact of <a href="colonialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">colonialism</a>, the incorporation of Africa into
the world capitalist economy, and the resultant class formation. The
chapter poses the question: "Is There an African Anarchism?" and touches
on indigenous ideas and movements like Nigeria's farm settlements
(modelled on Israeli
<a href="Kibbutz.md" class="wikilink" title="Kibbutz">Kibbutz</a>) and
Ghana's <a href="Awareness_League.md" class="wikilink"
title="Awareness League">Awareness League</a>.

**Chapter 4: The Development of Socialism in Africa** - This chapter
looks at how colonialism superimposed capitalism on Africa, creating new
class structures. It details the emergence and role of the trade union
movement in the liberation struggle, particularly in Nigeria and South
Africa, showcasing their fight against colonial exploitation and foreign
capital. It discusses the "revolution" in Guinea and the formation of
the <a href="Awareness_League.md" class="wikilink"
title="Awareness League">Awareness League</a> as an African anarchist
movement in Nigeria.

**Chapter 5: The Failure of Socialism in Africa** - This chapter argues
that various forms of "African socialism" failed to improve the lives of
ordinary people, often due to over-centralisation, reliance on state
power, and the perpetuation of class privilege. Case studies like Guinea
and Tanzania
(<a href="Ujamaa.md" class="wikilink" title="Ujamaa">Ujamaa</a> villages)
are presented to demonstrate how state capitalism and bureaucratic
centralism led to underdevelopment, instability, and political
corruption. The military's role in maintaining the status quo is also
analysed.

**Chapter 6: Obstacles to the Development of Anarchism in Africa** -
This section identifies key factors hindering anarchism's growth in
Africa, including the colonial education system that suppressed
indigenous thought and fostered individualism. It highlights the
capitalist-inspired legal systems, the military's role in preserving the
status quo, the prevalence of ethnic versus class consciousness, and
pervasive religious and cultural factors. The need for international
solidarity for emerging anarchist groups is emphasised.

**Chapter 7: Anarchism's Future in Africa** - This concluding chapter
ties Africa's prospects for anarchism to a global context, asserting
that the crises of capitalism and Marxist "socialism" worldwide open a
historical opportunity for anarchism. It reiterates the dire "African
Condition" of poverty, inequality, and dependence on foreign capital,
and argues that the modern nation-state system has failed Africa. The
book concludes that a return to the "anarchic elements" in African
communalism is "virtually inevitable" as the only viable path forward
for Africa, leading to a self-managed society based on freedom,
equality, and community.

### Key Arguments

The authors argue that:

- Traditional African societies contained many anarchistic elements,
  particularly in their consensus-based decision-making and lack of
  hierarchical state structures
- Post-colonial African socialism failed due to over-centralisation and
  reliance on state power
- Africa's future lies in returning to these traditional anarchistic
  elements while adapting them to modern conditions
- The similarities between anarchist beliefs and practices and those of
  traditional African societies suggest Africa is highly likely to
  witness a true social revolution

## Critiques

The book represents one of the few works examining anarchism from an
African perspective, addressing the scarcity of anarchist literature on
the continent. It challenges both capitalist and Marxist approaches to
African development by proposing anarchistic alternatives rooted in
traditional African social structures.
