*"<a   href="The_Joy_of_Sex.md" class="wikilink" title="The Joy of Sex">"The Joy

title="anti-nuclear movement">"anti-nuclear movement</a> and
"<a   href="pacifist.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifist">"pacifist</a>
activism, Comfort was described as "the true voice of nuclear
disarmament" and played a significant role in developing anarchist
thought through his application of scientific methodology to social and
political theory.[^1]

## Family

Comfort was born to Alexander Charles Comfort, an administrator in
education at the "<a   href="London_County_Council.md" class="wikilink"
title="London County Council">"London County Council</a>, and Daisy
Elizabeth (Fenner) Comfort, a former teacher who taught her son French
and Latin before he began formal schooling.

## Early Life

Comfort was born in
"<a   href="Palmers_Green.md" class="wikilink" title="Palmers Green">"Palmers
Green</a>, North London, and raised in
"<a   href="Barnet.md" class="wikilink" title="Barnet">"Barnet</a>,
"<a   href="Hertfordshire.md" class="wikilink"
title="Hertfordshire">"Hertfordshire</a>. He was educated at
"<a   href="Highgate_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Highgate School">"Highgate School</a> in London, where during
chemistry experiments he accidentally blew up his left hand, losing all
fingers except the thumb. He later claimed this proved "very useful for
performing uterine inversions" in his medical practice.[^2]

He developed a passion for
"<a   href="molluscs.md" class="wikilink" title="molluscs">"molluscs</a> during
family holidays in "<a   href="Hartland,_Devon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Hartland, Devon">"Hartland, Devon</a>, joining the

Comfort matriculated at
"<a   href="Trinity_College,_Cambridge.md" class="wikilink"
title="Trinity College, Cambridge">"Trinity College, Cambridge</a> to
study medicine, qualifying in 1944 with diplomas from the
"<a   href="Royal_College_of_Physicians.md" class="wikilink"

## Adulthood

### Medical and Scientific Career

Comfort served as a house physician at the
"<a   href="London_Hospital.md" class="wikilink"
title="London Hospital">"London Hospital</a> and later became a lecturer
in physiology at London Hospital Medical College. He obtained his PhD in
1949 from the "<a   href="University_of_London.md" class="wikilink"
title="University of London">"University of London</a> with a
dissertation on "The Acid-Soluble Pigments of Molluscan Shells" and a
DSc in gerontology in 1962.

Comfort devoted much of the 1950s and 1960s to studying the biology of
ageing ("<a   href="biogerontology.md" class="wikilink"
title="biogerontology">"biogerontology</a>) and popularised the subject.
In 1969, he suggested that
"<a   href="life_expectancy.md" class="wikilink" title="life expectancy">"life
expectancy</a> could be extended to 120 years within 20 years, though he
believed ageing could be postponed rather than eliminated.

### Anarchist Political Development

Comfort's anarchism emerged from his
"<a   href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">"pacifism</a>, which
he described as resting "solely upon the historical theory of
anarchism". He considered himself "an aggressive anti-militarist" and
developed what he called a "sociological anarchism" based on scientific
observation rather than ideological dogma.

His anarchist philosophy was grounded in several key propositions:

- The rejection of power in society as both anti-social and unsound in
  biological terms
- Human solidarity and
  "<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
  against a hostile environment
- The application of scientific methodology to social and political
  problems
- Personal and social responsibility as alternatives to authoritarian
  control

### Anti-War Activism

During
"<a   href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">"World War
II</a>, Comfort was a "<a   href="conscientious_objector.md" class="wikilink"
title="conscientious objector">"conscientious objector</a> and wrote
forcefully against the
"<a   href="Allied_bombing.md" class="wikilink" title="Allied bombing">"Allied
bombing</a> of civilians. In a 1943 letter to
*"<a   href="Tribune_(magazine).md" class="wikilink"
title="Tribune">"Tribune</a>*, he denounced the bombardment of Europe as
"the work of bloodthirsty fools" and contrasted the "alacrity and
satisfaction" with which bombing operations were conducted with British
reluctance to admit "<a   href="Jewish_refugees.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jewish refugees">"Jewish refugees</a>.

This led to a public controversy with
"<a   href="George_Orwell.md" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">"George
Orwell</a>, who accused pacifists of being "objectively pro-fascist".
Comfort defended pacifism in an open letter/poem titled "Letter to an
American Visitor" under the pseudonym Obadiah Hornbrooke.

### Nuclear Disarmament Movement

Comfort was among the first to denounce the atomic bombing of
"<a   href="Hiroshima.md" class="wikilink" title="Hiroshima">"Hiroshima</a> and
became a leading figure in the nuclear disarmament movement. He was an
active member of the "<a   href="Peace_Pledge_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peace Pledge Union">"Peace Pledge Union</a> and later the
"<a   href="Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament.md" class="wikilink"
title="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament">"Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament</a>.

At the 1958 CND launch meeting, he declared: "The people must take
over... The issue is one for direct action."

As an original member of the "<a   href="Committee_of_100.md" class="wikilink"
title="Committee of 100">"Committee of 100</a>, Comfort was sentenced to
a month's imprisonment alongside
"<a   href="Bertrand_Russell.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bertrand Russell">"Bertrand Russell</a> and other activists for
organising the Trafalgar Square sit-down demonstration in September
1961. He regularly appeared on the pirate radio station Voice of Nuclear
Disarmament and authored anti-nuclear songs, including the collection
*Are You Sitting Comfortably?*

### Literary and Intellectual Work

Comfort published his first book, *The Silver River*, in 1938 while
still at school. His literary career included novels such as *No Such
Liberty* (1941), *The Power House* (1944), and *On This Side Nothing*
(1949), as well as several volumes of poetry.

His key anarchist works include:

- *Art and Social Responsibility* (1946)
- *Peace and Disobedience* (1946)
- *Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State* (1950)

*Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State*, subtitled "A
criminological approach to the problem of power", is considered
Comfort's most important contribution to anarchist thought. The work
argues that both democratic and totalitarian societies tend to select
potentially anti-social individuals for positions of power, and that
"obedience in modern societies is more often a hideous vice than a
Christian virtue".

### Sexual Liberation and *The Joy of Sex*

*The Joy of Sex* (1972) brought Comfort international fame and earned
him \$3 million, though he was ambivalent about being known as "Dr. Sex"
rather than for his other work. The book was revolutionary in its
approach to sexuality, emphasising mutual respect, communication, and
the removal of guilt and violence from sexual relationships.

Comfort's approach to sexuality was deeply connected to his anarchism.
He argued that sex was "one of the most basic and profoundly formative
ways that we can achieve sociality" and that healthy sexual
relationships taught people to "share power in relationships rather than
compete for it".

His moral code regarding sexuality consisted of two principles: "Thou
shalt not exploit another person's feelings" and "Thou shalt under no
circumstances cause the birth of an unwanted child."

### Personal Life

After the success of *The Joy of Sex*, Comfort divorced his wife of
thirty years and married Jane Henderson in 1973. The couple moved to
"<a   href="Santa_Barbara,_California.md" class="wikilink"
title="Santa Barbara, California">"Santa Barbara, California</a>, where
Comfort worked at the
"<a   href="Center_for_the_Study_of_Democratic_Institutions.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions">"Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions</a>.

They frequented the "<a   href="Sandstone_Retreat.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sandstone Retreat">"Sandstone Retreat</a>, a clothing-optional
community promoting open sexuality. In 1985, they returned to England,
where they lived in
"<a   href="Kent.md" class="wikilink" title="Kent">"Kent</a>.

## Death

Comfort suffered a severe cerebral haemorrhage in 1991, after which his
son from his first marriage became his caretaker. Jane Henderson died
soon after the haemorrhage. Comfort died on 26 March 2000 at age eighty.

One of his final public acts was writing to
*"<a   href="The_Guardian.md" class="wikilink" title="The Guardian">"The
