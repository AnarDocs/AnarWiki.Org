![](Dailyworker.jpg "Dailyworker.jpg") From Colin Ward, Anarchy in
Action [^1]:

> Between June and October of \[1946\] 40,000 homeless people in England
> and Wales, acting on their own initiative, occupied over 1,000 army
> camps. They organised every kind of communal service in the attempt to
> make these bleak huts more like home - communal cooking, laundering
> and nursery facilities, for instance. They also federated into a
> Squatters' Protection Society. One feature of these squatter
> communities was that they were formed from people who had very little
> in common beyond their homelessness - they included tinkers and
> university dons...
>
> The 1946 campaign was based on the large-scale seizure of army camps
> emptied at the end of the war. It started in May of that year when
> some homeless families in Lincolnshire occupied an empty camp, and it
> spread like wildfire until hundreds of camps were seized in every part
> of Britain. By October 1,038 camps had been occupied by 40,000
> families in England and Wales, and another 5,000 families in Scotland.
> That month, Aneurin Bevan, the Minister of Health who was responsible
> for the government's housing programme, accused the squatters of
> 'jumping their place in the housing queue'. In fact, of course, they
> were jumping right out of the queue by moving into buildings which
> would not otherwise have been used for housing purposes. Then suddenly
> the Ministry of Works, which had previously declared itself not
> interested, found it possible to offer the Ministry of Health 850
> former service camps, and squatting became 'official'.
>
> Some of the original squatter communities lasted for years. Over a
> hundred families, who in 1946 occupied a camp known as Field Farm in
> Oxfordshire, stayed together and twelve years later were finally
> rehoused in the new village of Berinsfield on the same site.
>
> A very revealing account of the differences between the 'official' and
> the 'unofficial' squatters comes from a newspaper account of a camp in
> Lancashire after the first winter:
>
> > There are two camps within the camp - the official squatters (that
> > is the people placed in the huts after the first invasion) and the
> > unofficial squatters (the veterans, who have been allowed to remain
> > on sufferance). Both pay the same rent of lOs a week - but there the
> > similarity ends. Although one would have imagined that the
> > acceptance of rent from both should accord them identical
> > privileges, in fact, it does not. Workmen have put up partitions in
> > the huts of the official squatters and have put in sinks and other
> > numerous conveniences. These are the sheep; the goats have perforce
> > to fend for themselves.
> >
> > A commentary on the situation was made by one of the young welfare
> > officers attached to the housing department. On her visit of
> > inspection she found that the goats had set to work with a will,
> > impro­vising partitions, running up curtains, distempering, painting
> > and using initiative, The official squatters, on the other hand, sat
> > about glumly without using initiative or lending a hand to help
> > themselves and bemoaning their fate, even though might have been
> > removed from the most appalling slum property. Until the overworked
> > corporation workmen got around to them they would not attempt to
> > improve affairs themselves.[^2]
>
> This story reveals a great deal about the state of mind that is
> induced by free and independent action, and that which is induced by
> dependence and inertia: the difference between people who initiate
> things and act for themselves and people to whom things just happen.
