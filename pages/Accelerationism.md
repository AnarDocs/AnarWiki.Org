# Accelerationism

## Overview

**Accelerationism** is a range of political and philosophical positions
that call for the intensification of capitalism and technological
development as a means to create radical social transformations. While
originating in post-Marxist philosophy, accelerationism has been subject
to extensive critique and reappropriation by
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>
and "<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="left-libertarians">"left-libertarians</a>, who have both
criticized its authoritarian tendencies and attempted to develop
distinctly anti-authoritarian variants.

The term was coined by Benjamin Noys in 2010 to describe trajectories in
post-structuralist thought, particularly the work of
"<a   href="Gilles_Deleuze.md" class="wikilink" title="Gilles Deleuze">"Gilles
Deleuze</a> and
"<a   href="Félix_Guattari.md" class="wikilink" title="Félix Guattari">"Félix
Guattari</a>, who in *"<a   href="Anti-Oedipus.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Oedipus">"Anti-Oedipus</a>* wrote: "perhaps the flows are not
yet deterritorialized enough, not decoded enough, from the viewpoint of
a theory and a practice of a highly schizophrenic character. Not to
withdraw from the process, but to go further, to 'accelerate the
process.'"[^1]

Accelerationism divides into several variants: right-accelerationism
associated with
"<a   href="Nick_Land.md" class="wikilink" title="Nick Land">"Nick Land</a>
that celebrates capitalist deterritorialization; left-accelerationism
associated with Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams that seeks to repurpose
capitalist infrastructure for
"<a   href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialism">"socialism</a>;
and unconditional accelerationism (u/acc) which attempts to move beyond
left-right distinctions. Each has faced significant criticism from
anarchist theorists.

## Anarchist Critiques

### The False Dialectic

Anarchist theorist Andrew Culp has articulated a fundamental critique of
accelerationist dialectics, identifying three main problematic
approaches within accelerationist thought: "the boomerang pattern of the
rebound, the fascist addiction to speed, and the techno-scientific dream
of a technological fix."[^2]

The "rebound" position argues that conditions must worsen before they
can improve - that only after "hitting rock bottom" can society rise up.
Culp dismisses this as the domain of "contrarian provocateurs" whose
shock value wears off quickly. This strategy of pursuing
"<a   href="immiseration.md" class="wikilink"
title="immiseration">"immiseration</a> to raise consciousness is
critiqued as historically bankrupt, having failed repeatedly when
applied to actual oppression.[^3]

The fascist worship of speed, exemplified by Italian Futurism and Nazi
"<a   href="blitzkrieg.md" class="wikilink" title="blitzkrieg">"blitzkrieg</a>
tactics, represents another dangerous accelerationist tendency. Culp
notes that when asked about his amphetamine-fueled writings, Nick Land
attributed them to "the clawed embrace of the undead amphetamine god,"
downplaying the explicitly fascistic elements of speed-worship.[^4]

The technocratic "technological fix" represents perhaps the most
insidious variant, as it recapitulates authoritarian Marxist fantasies
of scientific management. Culp traces this from Edward Bellamy's
socialist utopia of automated labor through Soviet modernization
projects to contemporary "socialism with Chinese characteristics."[^5]

### The Authoritarian Turn

Anarchist writer William Gillis provides perhaps the most scathing
critique of left-accelerationism in his review of the *Manifesto for an
Accelerationist Politics* (MAP). Gillis argues that accelerationism
"fails to accurately diagnose the root forces driving progress within
society today as immediately liberatory and thus it poses a false or
confused tension whereby 'the bad' must be intensified for progress to
be made."[^6]

More damningly, Gillis identifies an explicitly authoritarian agenda
within left-accelerationism. The MAP declares: "Secrecy, verticality,
and exclusion all have their place as well in effective political
action... We need to posit a collectively controlled legitimate vertical
authority in addition to distributed horizontal forms of sociality."[^7]
This represents a fundamental betrayal of anti-authoritarian principles,
rejecting "<a   href="horizontalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="horizontalism">"horizontalism</a> and
"<a   href="decentralization.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralization">"decentralization</a> in favor of vanguardist
technocracy.

Gillis notes the absurdity of left-accelerationists positively citing
Project Cybersyn - Salvador Allende's failed experiment in
"<a   href="cybernetic.md" class="wikilink" title="cybernetic">"cybernetic</a>
central planning - as a model for future socialism. He characterizes
this as "science denialism" that ignores the fundamental computational
complexity problems that make centralized planning impossible: "You
can't simply shuffle around matters of information and calculation and
pretend they're no longer a problem."[^8]

The MAP's call for "government funded think tanks" and an "intellectual
infrastructure" reveals its true character as an academic elite seeking
to establish themselves as a technocratic vanguard. Gillis argues this
represents not a break with "<a   href="primitivism.md" class="wikilink"
title="primitivism">"primitivism</a> but rather "the same old antiquated
Marxist and Continental garbage. A mixture of insular elitism and the
very anti-intellectual currents of localism and immediacy."[^9]

### The Market Question

A central anarchist critique concerns accelerationism's conflation of
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
and "<a   href="free_market.md" class="wikilink" title="markets">"markets</a>.
Gillis argues that "capitalism — in the sense of macroscopic tendencies
of capital accumulation, normalized wage labor and attendant dynamics —
is if anything radically opposed to innovation and meaningful growth.
It's not a matter of capitalism having internal contradictions so much
as capitalism and the market being radically different creatures."[^10]

This distinction, central to
"<a   href="left-wing_market_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="left-wing market anarchism">"left-wing market anarchism</a>,
allows for a very different analysis than that offered by
accelerationists. Markets represent deterritorializing forces that
undermine hierarchies through distributed decision-making and
information processing. Capitalism represents reterritorializing forces
that concentrate power and wealth. The two are "often separable dynamics
or in serious conflict."[^11]

From this perspective, what should be accelerated is not capitalism but
rather the market forces that work against it - the underground
economies, the
"<a   href="commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">"commons</a>, the
decentralized technologies, and the alternative institutions that route
around capitalist power structures.

## Anarcho-Accelerationism

### Defining the Position

In response to both left and right accelerationism, some anarchist
theorists have attempted to formulate distinctly anti-authoritarian
variants. Writer Black Cat has proposed "anarcho-accelerationism" (a/acc
or an/acc) as a synthesis of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a> and
unconditional accelerationist concepts.[^12]

Black Cat argues that "anarchism is really the maximization of Exit" -
the ability to leave oppressive systems and create alternative
institutions.[^13] This reframes anarchism not as the abolition of
hierarchy per se, but as the proliferation of alternatives that allow
people to route around hierarchical systems.

Drawing on unconditional accelerationism, anarcho-accelerationism
emphasizes:

- Fighting "the war against the imagination" through creation of new
  possibilities[^14]
- Recognizing individual insignificance while seeking personal freedom
  rather than attempting to change the entire world[^15]
- Questioning "<a   href="universalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="universalism">"universalism</a> as a form of totalitarianism
- Celebrating diverse "safe spaces" and alternative societies rather
  than imposing uniform systems[^16]

### Stateless Patchwork

A key concept in anarcho-accelerationism is "stateless Patchwork" - the
proliferation of alternative institutions and communities with different
norms, rather than geographically-defined territories. Black Cat argues
that "there is no such thing as a 'staton' particle that could be
measured in a lab" - states are merely abstractions over collections of
individuals.[^17]

This stateless Patchwork already exists in actually-existing alternative
institutions: "gay bars, autism support groups, whisper networks,
fraternities, punk scenes, goths, anarchists, etc."[^18] These spaces
offer exit to different norms and social relations without requiring
territorial control.

Black Cat connects this to
"<a   href="agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="agorism">"agorism</a>: "Whether
you create a non-state Patch, or do a market insurrection, you are doing
the same thing: creating an alternate institution, to route around the
undesirable institutions and norms of the status quo."[^19]

### Post-Truth and Hyperstition

Anarcho-accelerationism embraces a controversial position on truth.
Black Cat argues that in a truly pluralistic society, "there will be
less and less that everyone agrees is true" because different
communities will have "their own set of basic beliefs about the
world."[^20]

This connects to the accelerationist concept of
"<a   href="hyperstition.md" class="wikilink"
title="hyperstition">"hyperstition</a> - ideas that make themselves real
through being believed. Using the example of "gri-gri" (magical
bullet-proofing) in Sub-Saharan African resistance movements, Black Cat
argues that beliefs spread not primarily on their provability but on
their evolutionary fitness: "If a belief causes a Patch to be
successful, it will likely continue and likely be copied by other
similar Patches."[^21]

While controversial, this position argues that diverse epistemologies
enable diverse social experiments: "By embracing post-truth, we will
enable a world of much more varied institutions."[^22]

## Market Insurrection

### Insurrectionary Accelerationism

Several anarchist theorists have connected accelerationist concepts to
"<a   href="insurrectionary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionary anarchism">"insurrectionary anarchism</a>. Culp
distinguishes revolutionary from insurrectionary anarchism:
revolutionary anarchism sees transition away from statism as "a clearly
defined event" of formal battle, while insurrectionary anarchism sees it
as "happening in a continuous and distributed manner" through "many
different constantly-operating small-scale rebellions."[^23]

Applied to accelerationism, this suggests that "the system itself" is
insurrecting - that capitalism contains forces that undermine it. As
Mark Fisher argued, "For Deleuze and Guattari, capitalism is defined by
the way it simultaneously engenders and inhibits processes of
destratification... It does not mean accelerating any or everything in
capitalism willy-nilly... Rather, it means accelerating the processes of
destratification that capitalism cannot but obstruct."[^24]

From this perspective, anarchist praxis involves "amplifying the
system's counter-system tendencies" - supporting and creating
"institutions that run counter to the interests of capitalism" including
"theft rings, squatter's support groups, homeless camps, assassination
markets, market spaces likely to facilitate illegal transactions, and
technological supports for these."[^25]

### Agorism and Actually Existing Acceleration

Black Cat connects accelerationism to
"<a   href="agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="agorism">"agorism</a> - the
strategy of building "<a   href="counter-economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="counter-economic">"counter-economic</a> institutions in the black
and grey markets to deprive the state of revenue and build alternative
social relations. Significantly, Black Cat notes that "a lot of people
really do this in real life — for non-ideological reasons. The poorest
sections of the working class already are engaged in agorism, they just
don't call it that."[^26]

This insight reveals "Actually Existing Agorism" - the ways marginalized
people already live "semi-statelessly in the ostensible midst of the
state." This shows that "direct action" need not look political or even
be particularly intentional, and that "the 'new society, built in the
cracks of the old' might not be best represented by the activities of
activists."[^27]

The technological developments of recent decades represent a form of
market insurrection: "Torrenting has eroded IP, crowdfunding has eroded
publishing, crypto has eroded state-issued monetary systems, the
internet has (at least to some extent, before state- and
corporate-driven reterritorialization) eroded the centralization of
speech."[^28]

## Complexity and Computation

### Against Artificial Simplicity

Gillis argues that a proper break with primitivism requires embracing
rather than fleeing from complexity. The left has "systematically
disregarded computational complexity" and instead "embraced
simplicity" - critiquing systems as "too complex" to understand while
simultaneously deriding them as insufficiently organic.[^29]

But "the only substantive distinction between the mechanical and the
organic is one of fluidic complexity." As social systems become more
complex - more organic - they become harder for power structures to
control: "We should be deepening the vibrant, rich, lush complexities of
human interrelation in the internet era, not just because as we do this
power structures like the state and silicon valley tech giants falter
and find themselves less and less capable of control, but because such
complexity is inextricably tied to expressions and experiences of
liberation."[^30]

This suggests that what appears as the tyranny of incomprehensible
systems is actually the growing complexity that makes authoritarian
control increasingly impossible. The proper anarchist response is to
intensify this complexity rather than retreat to artificially simple
solutions like "<a   href="universal_basic_income.md" class="wikilink"
title="universal basic income">"universal basic income</a> or centralized
planning.

### Information Theory and Liberation

Gillis argues that accelerationism fails by not centering
information-theoretical constraints: "Just as you can't shuffle around
carbon costs and pretend to have erased them, you can't simply shuffle
around matters of information and calculation and pretend they're no
longer a problem."[^31]

The market's computational power - its ability to process vastly
distributed information through price signals and competition -
represents not capitalist death but organic life struggling against the
mechanical impositions of capital accumulation and state planning. Power
"abhors complexity" and increasingly attacks the internet, cryptography,
and distributed technologies that enable complex coordination without
centralized control.[^32]

From this perspective, the crisis of contemporary capitalism is
precisely that "capitalism is decidedly not succeeding at
reterritorializing. The complexities of our world are growing ever more
out of control."[^33] The proper accelerationist strategy is therefore
to intensify these complexities - to build more robust cryptographic
systems, more resilient distributed networks, more diverse alternative
institutions.

### Against Political Solutions

Culp argues that accelerationism should reject the project of politics
itself in favor of what Deleuze and Guattari called the "nomad war
machine." Where politics offers solutions and manages existing power
relations, the partisan war machine "presents itself as challenge to
politics because it appears in a way that politics itself is not able to
resolve."[^34]

This distinction maps onto the difference between tools and weapons.
"Tools are introceptive, as they centripetally draw forces inward toward
the center like a net" while "weapons are projective, as they send
forces outward and away like a missile."[^35] Politics transforms
everything into tools for work and control, while the war machine
transforms tools into weapons for liberation.[^36]

The partisan perspective refuses universalism and the "world picture" of
accelerationist politics. Instead it promises "a future so different
that it no longer resembles the present."[^37] This connects to
"<a   href="insurrectionary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionary anarchism">"insurrectionary anarchism</a>'s
slogan: "don't smash the state, erode it."[^38]

### The Problem of Prometheanism

Culp critiques the "Prometheanism" common to many accelerationists - the
belief that problems stem from insufficient mastery over nature and
society. He notes the strangeness of invoking Prometheus, whose myth is
"not one of heroic mastery but a cautionary tale of hubris."[^39]

In Hesiod's version, Prometheus's theft of fire leads Zeus to create
Pandora, who releases all evils into the world. The lesson, Culp argues,
is that "every technical advancement comes at a cost."[^40] Even Donna
Haraway's celebrated cyborg is "a creature of compromise, fashioned from
techniques born from the military, patriarchal capitalism, and
authoritarian socialism."[^41]

This critique challenges the accelerationist assumption that more
technology and rationality will straightforwardly solve problems,
suggesting instead a more cautious and critical relationship to
technological development.

## Gay Bars and Alternative Modernity

=

### Example of Actually Existing Patchwork

Black Cat offers gay bars as perhaps "one of the most accessible
examples of Actually Existing Patchwork" due to their success and
visibility.[^42] Facing a hostile, unchangeable society where they were
inevitably a minority, queer people did "the only thing that they could
do: they created queer communities, and they retreated to them."[^43]

In these communities, different norms emerged - heteronormativity was
exchanged for alternative frameworks. Different institutions were
created through "new sacred games" and "new festivals: drag queens,
flags, celebrations of their own 'gay icons', their own remembrances of
fallen heroes."[^44]

Importantly, "the gay bars were not at all first. It was the growth of
queer communities that allowed the gay bars to come into being — the
market niche was created through the creation of a community."[^45] This
demonstrates how alternative institutions emerge from alternative
communities rather than being imposed top-down.

### Spreading the Outside

The system attempted to suppress this alternative modernity but failed.
The "queerness within the gay community spread out into the world, in
pride parades, into mass media, in the form of civil rights legislation
and rulings."[^46]

Crucially, "this was never intended" - no one at the first gay bar "saw
the grand checkmate that they would achieve." Once alternative spaces
were created "with their alternate beliefs, institutions, and norms —
the dynamics of the system were out of the hands of their
creators."[^47]

This example demonstrates how "any form of Exit... has a tendency to let
the Outside in. The ability to access external possibilities inevitably
affects the imagination and desires of those who remain within
mainstream society."[^48] Alternative institutions don't just provide
escape - they transform the broader society by proving other
possibilities exist.

## Criticism

### The Nihilist Trap

Multiple critics have identified nihilism as a core problem with
accelerationism. Gillis argues that nihilism acts as "a cognitive stop,
a get-out-of-thinking-free excuse" that either forms arbitrary feedback
loops or leads to reactionary positions.[^49]

The claim that "there is no escape" from capitalism can become an excuse
for surrendering critical analysis. Gillis notes that "the truth is
there may very well be an escape from the present situation in localist,
luddite, or anti-rationalist terms, and that escape towards primitivism
is what power wants."[^50] The ruling class often prefers subjects who
accept simplification and crisis over those demanding complexity and
possibility.

Black Cat, while more sympathetic to accelerationist concepts,
acknowledges the danger of "anti-praxis" - the idea that since the
system is totalizing, all actions ultimately serve it. Against this,
anarcho-accelerationism argues that desire can still exist partially
outside systemic control, making genuine resistance possible.[^51]

### Class and Academic Elitism

Gillis delivers perhaps the harshest critique regarding class politics:
"Accelerationism is — we must address the elephant in the room —
fundamentally an academic position. Unintelligible outside a discourse
of continental philosophy that is inextricably an expression of
class."[^52]

The continental philosophical tradition from which accelerationism
emerges "has encouraged the enfranchising of new hierarchies, new
ecologies of power relations, competitive games of positioning via
masturbatory clouds of language utterly attenuated from anything
rooted."[^53] It creates "artificial economies of intellectual capital"
that exclude non-academics.

Gillis argues that "the people presently blazing the future are not
continental academics and humanities majors at rich private liberal arts
colleges. They're anarchist hackers and direct actionists. Or scientists
and engineers."[^54] The academic discourse of accelerationism has had
"absolutely zero impact on the ground."[^55]

The hunger for "government funded think tanks" and technocratic
leadership reveals left-accelerationism's fundamentally elitist
character - "the bourgeois twentysomething trending bohemian and looking
for opinions to champion at dinner parties."[^56]

### Failure of Imagination

Culp and others argue that accelerationism ultimately represents a
failure of imagination despite its revolutionary pretensions. By
accepting capitalism's self-characterization as inevitable or necessary,
accelerationism forecloses alternatives that don't pass through
capitalist intensification.

Culp notes the importance of Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed*,
which imagines a world where "the cost of freedom from capitalism is
life on a barren moon."[^57] The novel's subtitle - "an ambiguous
utopia" - challenges the accelerationist assumption that advanced
technology is necessary for liberation: "Its science and technology are
not hyper-advanced, for such communism does not require incredible
sophistication."[^58]

This suggests that accelerationism's fixation on technological
development may itself be a form of capitalist realism - an inability to
imagine social transformation that doesn't follow capitalism's own
metrics of progress.
