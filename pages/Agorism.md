I'll integrate Carson's valuable perspective on counter-economics from
an anarchist standpoint. Here's the revised article:

# Agorism

## Overview

**Agorism** is a market-based political philosophy developed by Samuel
Edward Konkin III that advocates achieving a stateless society through
counter-economics - participation in black and grey markets that operate
outside state control.[^1] The term derives from the Greek word "agora,"
meaning marketplace. While originating from right-libertarian circles
and sharing significant ideological overlap with
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">"anarcho-capitalism</a>, agorism distinguishes
itself through its revolutionary strategy of building alternative
economic systems rather than gradual reform or violent insurrection.

From an
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
perspective, agorism presents a contradictory position: while its
counter-economic tactics of evading state control through black markets
resemble
"<a   href="illegalism.md" class="wikilink" title="illegalism">"illegalism</a>
and may offer practical value, its retention of
"<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">"private property</a>, wage labor, and market
fundamentalism make it incompatible with anarchist principles of
collective liberation and the abolition of all hierarchies.

## Origins

Agorism emerged in the 1970s within the American libertarian movement.
Samuel Edward Konkin III first presented the theory at a conference
organized by J. Neil Schulman in 1974 in Cheshire, Massachusetts. The
philosophy was subsequently detailed in Konkin's *New Libertarian
Manifesto* (1980) and popularized through Schulman's novel *Alongside
Night* (1979), which portrayed counter-economics in fictional form.[^2]

Konkin developed agorism during a period of intense debate within
libertarian circles about tactical approaches to achieving a stateless
society. Rejecting both electoral politics (which he termed
"partyarchy") and violent revolution, Konkin proposed counter-economics
as a third path - what he called "revolution through market
processes."[^3]

The philosophy explicitly built on
"<a   href="Austrian_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Austrian School">"Austrian School</a> economics, particularly the
work of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. However, Konkin positioned
agorism as "to the left" of Rothbard, seeking alliance with the anti-war
New Left and distinguishing his movement from conservative
libertarianism. He founded the Movement of the Libertarian Left to
emphasize this positioning.[^4]

## Core Principles

### Counter-Economics

The central strategy of agorism is **counter-economics**, defined by
Konkin as "the study and/or practice of all peaceful human action which
is forbidden by the State."[^5] This encompasses what Konkin categorized
as:

- **Black markets** - Activities that are illegal but non-violent (drug
  trade, unlicensed services, tax evasion)
- **Grey markets** - Legal goods and services obtained or distributed in
  ways prohibited by the state
- **White markets** - State-approved economic activity (to be avoided or
  minimized)
- **Red markets** - Violence and theft not approved by the state
  (explicitly rejected)

Counter-economic activities include bartering, alternative currencies,
illegal immigration, tax evasion, unlicensed businesses, drug
trafficking, prostitution, smuggling, and other voluntary exchanges
prohibited by state regulation.[^6] Agorists view these activities as
simultaneously providing immediate liberation from state control while
gradually building the infrastructure to replace state services.

The strategy operates on two levels identified by Per Bylund:[^7]

- **Vertical/introverted** - Building decentralized local infrastructure
  through neighborhood networks, community technology, and self-reliance
  systems
- **Horizontal/extroverted** - Creating black market networks using
  personal connections, online platforms, and expanding beyond local
  communities

### Agorist Class Theory

Agorism employs a three-part class analysis that distinguishes between
types of capital holders:[^8]

- **Entrepreneurs/innovators** - Risk-takers and producers who are the
  "strength of the free market" (positive)
- **Non-statist capitalists** - Holders of capital who are "relatively
  drone-like non-innovators" (neutral)
- **Statist capitalists** - Those who benefit from state privileges and
  regulations (negative - "the main Evil")

Konkin argued this differs from anarcho-capitalist analysis, which
conflates the first two categories, and from Marxist analysis, which
conflates all three. Agorists view the state as protecting statist
capitalists from market competition, with the counter-economy gradually
eroding these privileges.

### Property and Organization

Agorists maintain a propertarian position based on self-ownership and
"<a   href="Homestead_Principle.md" class="wikilink"
title="homesteading">"homesteading</a>. While opposing state-granted
corporate privileges (particularly limited liability), they support
private ownership of means of production and voluntary employment
relationships.

Konkin stated he had "no 'moral' opposition to 'hierarchy' in the
workplace" but preferred promoting a society of independent contractors
and entrepreneurs as optimal for eliminating state power.[^9] This
represents a significant departure from anarchist principles of
workplace democracy and workers' self-management.

## Relationship to Anarchism

### Tactical Utility for Anarchists

Some anarchists, particularly those influenced by
"<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">"mutualism</a> and
market-oriented approaches, have identified potential tactical value in
counter-economics while rejecting agorism's capitalist framework.

**Left-Market Anarchist Adaptations** - Writers like Kevin Carson have
argued that counter-economics as a strategy can be separated from
Konkin's narrow definition and propertarian ideology. Carson critiques
Konkin for viewing "illegality as a means to an end" rather than
recognizing that "evading the state is not an end in itself; it is,
rather, a means of accomplishing what we would want to accomplish for
its own sake, even if the state never existed."[^10]

From this anarchist perspective, counter-economics becomes synonymous
with building "<a   href="counter-institutions.md" class="wikilink"
title="counter-institutions">"counter-institutions</a>,
"<a   href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">"dual power</a>,
and "building the foundation of the new society within the shell of the
old" - focusing on creating the kind of society desired rather than
simply evading state regulation.[^11]

**Barter Networks and Local Currencies** -
"<a   href="LETS.md" class="wikilink" title="LETS">"LETS</a> (Local Exchange
Trading Systems), time banks, and local currency systems like Ithaca
Hours represent counter-economic tools that anarchists can employ. These
enable producers to exchange goods and services directly outside the
corporate-state nexus and wage system. During economic depressions, such
systems have historically allowed unemployed workers to continue
producing for each other when conventional money dried up - examples
include Owenite Labour Notes, the Wörgl local currency system during the
Great Depression, and California's Unemployed Cooperative Relief
Organization.[^12]

However, as Ted Trainer notes, local currency systems alone are
insufficient if they merely become discount programs for conventional
businesses rather than enabling actual counter-economic production. The
key is empowering workers to produce directly for barter networks rather
than simply exchanging wage-earned money for local scrip.[^13]

**Household Microenterprises** - Counter-economic production using
ordinary household capital goods represents a low-overhead alternative
to wage labor: home-based microbakeries using kitchen ovens, unlicensed
transportation using family vehicles, neighborhood childcare facilities
operated from homes, home-sewing businesses. These enterprises can
operate through barter networks with minimal capital outlay and no
pressure to scale up, allowing incremental shifts from wage employment
to self-employment.[^14]

State licensing requirements and health codes function precisely to
prevent such microenterprises by mandating industrial-scale equipment
and overhead that force people into wage employment. Counter-economic
circumvention of these regulations directly challenges the barriers that
concentrate economic power.

**Direct Exchange Benefits** - When workers exchange services directly
through barter networks rather than hiring each other's labor through
employers, they avoid the overhead costs extracted by capitalist
middlemen. An electrician and plumber exchanging services directly need
only work one hour each to obtain an hour of the other's labor, rather
than working two and a half hours of wage labor to hire the other
through conventional employment.[^15]

**Agora-Syndicalism** - This represents an attempted synthesis between
agorist counter-economics and "<a   href="syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalist">"syndicalist</a> organizing. The approach proposes
using counter-economic strategies alongside labor union organization to
transform enterprises into worker-run cooperatives, combining agorist
tax evasion and regulatory circumvention with syndicalist workplace
takeovers.[^16]

**Cooperative Agorism** - This variant integrates counter-economic
strategies with "<a   href="workers&#39;_cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; cooperatives">"workers' cooperatives</a>, mutual
banks, and
"<a   href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">"dual power</a>
organizing. It emphasizes building counter-economic institutions based
on cooperative principles rather than individual entrepreneurship,
potentially incorporating collective ownership and democratic governance
into counter-economic activity.[^17]

### Fundamental Incompatibilities

Despite tactical overlaps, most anarchists reject agorism for several
fundamental reasons:

**Private Property** - Agorism's commitment to private ownership of
productive property contradicts anarchist opposition to property as
theft and exploitation. As one anarchist critique states: "They don't
want to abolish private property, money, the free market and other
hierarchies. Capitalism won't go away by fueling it more via illegal
markets."[^18]

While counter-economic microenterprises might reduce dependence on large
corporations, they still perpetuate private ownership and potentially
recreate class divisions between those who own productive equipment and
those who do not.

**Hierarchy** - Agorism's acceptance of workplace hierarchy and wage
labor conflicts with anarchist principles of non-hierarchy and workers'
self-management. Agorists fail to explain how capitalist
authoritarianism will fail to arise from a society based on private
property and commercial markets.

Even if individual entrepreneurship reduces direct employer control, the
logic of market competition and property accumulation tends toward
recreating hierarchical economic structures.

**Market Fundamentalism** - Agorists view markets as natural and optimal
organizing principles, whereas most anarchists see markets as
potentially useful tools that must be subordinated to principles of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>,
solidarity, and collective well-being. Konkin's dismissal of communes
and communism as "defying the only enforceable law – the law of nature"
demonstrates this market fundamentalism that anarchists reject.

**Class Analysis** - The agorist class theory focuses on relationship to
the state rather than productive relations. Anarchists argue this
obscures exploitation inherent in wage labor and capital accumulation,
even in "free" markets. By distinguishing "good" entrepreneurs from
"bad" state capitalists while accepting "neutral" private capitalists,
agorism fails to challenge the fundamental dynamics of capitalist
accumulation.

**Limited Scope** - Agorism addresses only state oppression while
ignoring or accepting other forms of domination including patriarchy,
white supremacy, and ecological destruction. Most anarchist tendencies
embrace "thick" liberation that addresses all systems of oppression, not
merely state intervention.

**Individualism vs. Solidarity** - Agorism's emphasis on individual
entrepreneurship and profit-seeking contrasts with anarchist traditions
of collective organizing, mutual support, and solidarity economics. The
counter-economy envisioned by Konkin consists primarily of individual
entrepreneurs competing in markets, not workers cooperating through
mutual aid.

**Means and Ends** - Carson argues that Konkin confused means with ends
by making illegality definitional to counter-economics rather than
focusing on building desired social relations. Anarchists emphasize that
counter-economic activity should embody the values of the society being
created - cooperation, equality, solidarity - not simply evade state
regulation while perpetuating capitalist social relations.

## Anarchist Alternative Approaches

Anarchists pursuing similar goals of building alternative economies
emphasize fundamentally different principles and practices:

**Collective Ownership** -
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="Workers&#39; cooperatives">"Workers' cooperatives</a>,
"<a   href="commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">"commons</a>,
community land trusts, and collective workshops replace individual
entrepreneurship and private ownership of means of production.

**Gift Economies and Mutual Aid** -
"<a   href="Mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">"Mutual aid</a>
networks, "<a   href="Really_Really_Free_Markets.md" class="wikilink"
title="Really Really Free Markets">"Really Really Free Markets</a>, food
sharing programs, and gift economy practices replace market exchange and
profit-seeking as organizing principles.

**Direct Action and Solidarity Organizing** - Labor organizing, tenant
unions, community defense networks, and coordinated resistance
supplement or replace individual market participation as strategies for
building power.

**Solidarity Economics** - Economic activity explicitly rejects profit
maximization in favor of meeting community needs, democratic
decision-making, and equitable distribution.

**Ecological Sustainability** - Counter-institutions prioritize
ecological limits and regenerative practices rather than economic growth
or expansion of production.

**Counter-Institutions** - Following the Wobbly principle of "building
the new world in the shell of the old," anarchists create
"<a   href="free_schools.md" class="wikilink" title="free schools">"free
schools</a>, community health clinics, autonomous social centers, and
other institutions that prefigure desired social relations while meeting
immediate needs.

**Security Through Mutual Support** - Rather than achieving security
through individual entrepreneurship and market participation, anarchists
emphasize that genuine security comes from robust networks of mutual aid
where community members support each other regardless of ability to pay
or produce marketable goods.

As Carson notes, if counter-economic barter networks are merely "another
yuppified 'buy local' program for the Main Street establishment," they
offer little transformative potential. However, if reimagined as tools
for "ordinary working people to achieve independence from the corporate
state" through collective self-organization, mutual aid, and building
alternative institutions based on cooperation rather than competition,
counter-economic strategies could serve anarchist goals - but only by
fundamentally rejecting agorism's capitalist framework.

## Criticism

### From Anarchist Perspectives

Anarchists criticize agorism as essentially
"<a   href="anarcho-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">"anarcho-capitalism</a> "with extra steps" -
retaining capitalism's exploitative relations while claiming
revolutionary credentials through black market activity. The focus on
individual profit-seeking, even in counter-economic contexts,
perpetuates competitive rather than cooperative social relations.

The agorist strategy of "starving the state" through tax evasion may
simply shift exploitation from state to private actors without
fundamentally transforming social relations. Without challenging private
property and hierarchy, agorist "revolution" would likely reproduce
capitalist power structures in new forms - potentially creating even
more precarious conditions for workers operating in unregulated markets
without labor protections.

Agorism's rejection of collective action beyond market exchanges ignores
the necessity of solidarity organizing, mutual aid networks, and
coordinated resistance to capitalism. Its focus on entrepreneurship may
appeal primarily to those with resources to establish businesses rather
than offering liberation to the working class who lack capital for even
microenterprises.

The emphasis on individual risk-taking and entrepreneurship obscures how
collective action and solidarity provide more effective paths to
working-class power. A society of competing individual entrepreneurs,
even operating in black markets, still pits workers against each other
rather than building the solidarity necessary for genuine social
transformation.

### From Left-Market Anarchist Perspectives

Even sympathetic left-market anarchists like Carson critique Konkin's
formulation. By defining counter-economics primarily through illegality
and state-evasion, Konkin "define\[d\] our efforts in terms of the state
rather than in terms of our own self-derived goals." The state's
regulations exist largely "to prevent us from supporting ourselves in
comfort, independently of the corporate-state nexus and wage employment,
and from receiving the full product of our labor."[^19]

Therefore counter-economics should focus on building desired economic
relationships - cooperative production, direct exchange, mutual aid -
rather than on illegality per se. The goal is creating "the kind of
society and economy we want right now," not simply evading state
control.[^20]

Additionally, Konkin's vision remains limited to individual and
small-scale entrepreneurship. Without mechanisms for collective
ownership of larger-scale productive equipment, coordinated production
planning through federations or assemblies, or explicit solidarity
between producers and consumers, agorist counter-economics risks
recreating inequality and hierarchy even while operating outside state
regulation.
