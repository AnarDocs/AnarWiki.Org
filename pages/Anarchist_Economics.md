# Anarchist Economics

Anarchist economics encompasses diverse approaches to organizing
production, distribution, and exchange without hierarchical control,
private property in the means of production, or state authority.
Challenging the assumption that capitalism and state socialism are the
only viable economic systems, anarchist economic theory draws on both
historical practice and contemporary experiments to demonstrate
alternative ways of coordinating human needs and resources.

These systems range from gift economies that have sustained human
societies for millennia, to worker-controlled collectives, to
sophisticated proposals for cybernetic coordination that could leverage
modern technology for decentralised planning. Rather than accepting the
artificial scarcity and wealth concentration inherent in capitalism, or
the bureaucratic inefficiency of state planning, anarchist economics
explores how communities can democratically manage resources through
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
<a href="federation" class="wikilink" title="federation">federation</a>,
and direct participation.

The systems detailed below represent both theoretical frameworks
developed by anarchist thinkers and real-world implementations that have
successfully organised economic life — from the anarcho-syndicalist
collectives of <a href="Revolutionary_Catalonia" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a> to
contemporary cooperatives, time banks, and the gift economies of
open-source software communities.

## Shared Principles

Across the diversity of anarchist economic thought, several principles
recur as foundational commitments regardless of the specific system
proposed.

**Needs-based production** holds that economic activity should be
oriented toward meeting human needs rather than generating profit.
Rather than asking what can be sold, anarchist economics asks what
people require to live well — food, shelter, care, creative work,
meaningful participation — and organises production accordingly. This
stands in direct contrast to capitalist production, which generates
goods only when doing so returns profit to owners, leaving genuine needs
unmet while producing waste and superfluity.

**Decommodification** means removing goods, services, and human
relationships from the logic of market exchange. Under capitalism,
almost everything — labour, housing, healthcare, knowledge, water — is
transformed into a commodity to be bought and sold. Anarchist economics
seeks to withdraw necessities from this logic, making them available on
the basis of need rather than purchasing power. This does not require
the abolition of all exchange, but it does require that the basics of a
dignified life not be contingent on one's position in the market.

**Horizontal organisation** rejects the hierarchical structures through
which economic decisions are made under both capitalism and state
socialism. Rather than concentrating authority in owners, managers, or
central planners, anarchist economics distributes decision-making among
those directly affected — workers in their workplaces, communities in
their localities, users of shared resources. This does not mean the
absence of coordination or structure, but that such structure arises
from below through voluntary participation rather than being imposed
from above.

**Federation** addresses the question of scale. Horizontal organisation
at the level of a single workplace or commune must be connected across
wider territories to coordinate production, share resources, and address
collective needs. Anarchist economics proposes achieving this through
voluntary federation — networks of autonomous units coordinating with
one another without subordinating themselves to a central authority. The
federated model allows local autonomy while enabling the kind of
large-scale coordination that complex economies require.

These four principles — production for need, decommodification,
horizontal decision-making, and federated coordination — provide the
common ground across the otherwise varied landscape of anarchist
economic thought.

## Anarchist Economic Systems

- **<a href="Gift_Economy" class="wikilink" title="Gift Economy">Gift
  Economy</a>** (30,000+ years ago) — Distribution of goods and services
  without explicit agreement for future returns, based on reciprocity
  and social bonds rather than market exchange. Needs are met through
  voluntary contribution; surplus circulates freely rather than being
  accumulated.

  the full product of their labour.

Many of these systems do not use

mechanisms, or exchange at all; others use some form of tracking needs,
wants, or resources contributed and required. Several have been
implemented successfully in practice.
