# Anarchist Economics

Anarchist economics encompasses diverse approaches to organizing
production, distribution, and exchange without hierarchical control,
private property in the means of production, or state authority.
Challenging the assumption that capitalism and state socialism are the
only viable economic systems, anarchist economic theory draws on both
historical practice and contemporary experiments to demonstrate
alternative ways of coordinating human needs and resources.

These systems range from gift economies that have sustained human
societies for millennia, to worker-controlled collectives, to
sophisticated proposals for cybernetic coordination that could leverage
modern technology for decentralized planning. Rather than accepting the
artificial scarcity and wealth concentration inherent in capitalism, or
the bureaucratic inefficiency of state planning, anarchist economics
explores how communities can democratically manage resources through
mutual aid, federation, and direct participation.

The systems detailed below represent both theoretical frameworks
developed by anarchist thinkers and real-world implementations that have
successfully organized economic life—from the anarcho-syndicalist
collectives of Revolutionary Catalonia to contemporary cooperatives,
time banks, and the gift economies of open-source software communities.
