The <a href="Wikipedia:Shramik_Mukti_Dal" class="wikilink"
title="Shamrik Mukti Dal">Shamrik Mukti Dal</a> is a
“post-traditionalist communist” movement formed in rural Maharashta,
India in the 1980s. The movement's manifesto calls for “a new
ecologically balanced, prosperous, non-exploitative society” and
replacing the state with a “network of decentralized and ecologically
balanced agro-industrial centers.” The manifesto describes their
strategy as “striking one blow after another against the roots of the
established capitalist, casteist, patriarchal, socioeconomic
structure.”[^1]
