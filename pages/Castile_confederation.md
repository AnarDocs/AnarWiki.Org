# Castile Confederation

## History

### Origins

The **Castile Confederation** emerged in 1520 as a revolutionary
movement against the Spanish Crown's unfavorable tax policies. The
uprising began when Toledo's city council called upon all the cities
represented in the
<a href="Cortes.md" class="wikilink" title="Cortes">Cortes</a> to establish
a common front against the royal government.[^1]

City after city in Castile went into full-scale revolt, organizing civic
militias and democratizing their municipal governments. A national
junta—the equivalent of a confederal council—was established, with
delegates from all the Cortes cities, constituting a dual power in
opposition to the royal administration.[^2]

The movement was driven by the **comuneros** (commoners), who sought to
replace the monarchical State with a municipal confederation. Mustering
an army of citizens and adding professional soldiers, this *comunero*
junta won military victories that threatened the established royal
order.

### Current Status

The Castile Confederation was defeated in 1521 when the king militarily
defeated the popular *comuneros* after a demanding conflict that
included a siege of Toledo. The State ultimately prevailed over the
confederation, ending this experiment in

## Organisation

The confederation operated through a remarkably decentralized structure
that embodied principles of <a href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and
<a href="municipal_autonomy.md" class="wikilink"
title="municipal autonomy">municipal autonomy</a>. Political power
rested with the communes, which held assemblies much like "town
meetings" and would give their assent or opposition to proposed courses
of action by referendum.

The concrete aims of the *comunero* movement were **municipal
democracy** and a Cortes composed of city delegations that would greatly
limit royal authority. The movement's Valladolid articles demanded that
Cortes delegates be chosen with the consent of the parishes—that is, by
assemblies of the people—rather than by city councils.

These delegates were to be guided by the **mandate of their electors**
and were obligated to take their instructions from their home cities.
The Cortes was expected to meet regularly and address all grievances
before closing, establishing a system of
<a href="delegate_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="delegate democracy">delegate democracy</a> rather than
representative government.

The communes themselves decided upon matters of war and peace, as well
as domestic issues. They controlled their own judicial and economic
affairs, along with local police and military forces. The only central
"government" in the confederation was a commission with severely limited
powers, while the communes—that is, the citizens themselves, in
assembly—retained great authority.

## Economy

The confederation functioned along surprisingly **communistic lines**,
using local resources in ways that approximated
<a href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">collective ownership</a>. For example, they
privileged the right to graze cattle communally. In a pastoral economy,
common grazing such as they practiced amounted to overriding
<a href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> and negating private land
ownership.

This represented a practical implementation of
<a href="commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a>-based
resource management that challenged the prevailing feudal property
relations of the time.

## Criticism

The Castile Confederation faced opposition from the
<a href="Council_of_Castile.md" class="wikilink"
title="Council of Castile">Council of Castile</a>, which had been
established in 1480 as the chief administrative body of the realm.
Representatives of Valladolid's radical parishes blamed the Council's
"bad government" for the kingdom's troubles, highlighting the conflict
between centralized royal authority and the confederal democratic
experiment.

The Royal Council led the royalist forces against the rebels during the
uprising, with figures like Antonio de Rojas Manrique advocating for
vigorous punishment against the confederal rebels.
