"Mumbai turns out to be a pretty good place to be a dog," the *New York
Times* reported on 27 September 2017.[^1] In the Indian city, people
band together to feed stray dogs and make sure they receive medical
care: "The poorest people living on the streets barely have enough food
themselves, but they feed strays. And the rich, well, some go completely
overboard."[^2] Some people refer to dogs as "community dogs" instead of
stray dogs.

In 2017, photos went viral of Mumbai's dogs turning blue as a result of
a clothing company's dye polluting a river where dogs played. Neighbors
rallied to the dogs' assistance. A captured blue dog was given
veterinarian care and released. Near a factory, residents rescued a dog
from a ditch full of nitric acid. That dog became mostly blind, but
neighbors continued to care for it.[^3]

Refusing to kill stray dogs, the Indian government has enacted
sterlization as an alternative:

> The result in Mumbai, animal welfare experts say, is a virtuous cycle.
>
> Sterilized dogs, which don’t have puppies or prowl around for mates,
> tend to be more relaxed, which makes people less fearful of them,
> which makes the dogs friendlier, which makes people even more
> accepting of them.
