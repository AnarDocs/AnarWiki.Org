# State Formation

**State formation** is the process by which centralized political
authorities with monopolies on legitimate violence emerge and
consolidate control over defined territories and populations. This
process has occurred independently in multiple regions throughout human
history, following different pathways shaped by geography, culture,
warfare, economics, and ideology. How states formed remains contested,
with significant implications for theories about political organization,
social change, and the possibility of stateless societies.

No single theory adequately explains all instances of state formation.
Archaeological and anthropological evidence shows that states emerged
under varied conditions—sometimes from internal stratification,
sometimes through external conquest, and sometimes not at all despite
apparent preconditions. This diversity challenges unilinear evolutionary
models and demonstrates that state formation represents one possible
trajectory among many, rather than an inevitable stage of human social
development.

## Origins

### Marxist Historical Materialism

<a href="Friedrich_Engels" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> argued that states arise
from irreconcilable class antagonisms. As societies develop surplus
production beyond subsistence, classes with conflicting economic
interests emerge. The state appears as an instrument allowing the
economically dominant class to maintain control through 'special bodies
of armed men'. Engels proposed a universal sequence: primitive communism
→ surplus production → class divisions → state formation.[^1]

This theory profoundly influenced revolutionary movements worldwide but
faces substantial critiques. Anthropological evidence shows many
societies with surplus production that never formed states—Northwest
Coast Indigenous peoples had elaborate salmon economies, hereditary
slavery, and complex property systems yet remained stateless.
Conversely, some early states like Uruk emerged before substantial
agricultural surplus or clearly defined economic classes.

The theory's Eurocentrism becomes evident in
<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Marx">Marx</a>'s
characterization of non-European civilizations as stagnant and despotic
under an 'Asiatic mode of production'. The proposed universal sequence
derives from European historical experience and fails to describe
development in most of the world. Historical materialism cannot explain
colonial state formation, where European powers imposed state structures
on societies without internal class development—a pattern affecting the
majority of contemporary states.

Marx's views about state formation came largely from the documented
histories of European feudalism, Mediterranean antiquity, and Morgan's
ethnographic work on the Iroquois (which Marx selectively interpreted).
Studies of Northwest Coast Indigenous societies with elaborate class
systems but no states, Zomian populations deliberately evading state
incorporation for millennia, Aboriginal Australian societies maintaining
stability for 65,000 years without agriculture or centralized authority,
and archaeological evidence of monumental architecture preceding surplus
agriculture (such as Göbekli Tepe) have since demonstrated that his
assumptions were not universally true. This led to incorrect conclusions
that one could generalize from European development to universal human
history, that economic factors alone explained political structures,
that state formation was inevitable and irreversible, and that
resistance to centralization indicated backwardness rather than
conscious political choice. However, his insights about how exploitation
operates, how ruling classes use ideology to maintain power, and how
economic interests shape political institutions remain valuable for
understanding states once they exist.

### Social Contract Theories

Enlightenment philosophers proposed that states formed through rational
agreement.
<a href="Thomas_Hobbes" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas
Hobbes</a> argued individuals in a 'state of nature'—characterized by a
'war of all against all'—consented to surrender freedoms to a sovereign
in exchange for security.
<a href="John_Locke" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>
offered a more limited justification: individuals contracted to create
government protecting pre-existing rights to life, liberty, and
property. <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> proposed
legitimate states form when communities collectively agree to be
governed by the 'general will'.

These theories shaped modern political philosophy and constitutional
design. However, as explanations for how states actually formed
historically, they are deeply problematic. Archaeological and historical
evidence suggests conquest and coercion were far more common than
consent. Most documented state formations involved military subjugation,
colonial imposition, or consolidation of power by emerging elites—not
rational deliberation among equals.

Social contract theories are better understood as normative arguments
about how states ought to claim legitimacy rather than empirical
descriptions of how they actually formed. This matters because it
reveals how states legitimate themselves through origin myths—claiming
consent or divine mandate—whilst actually arising through conquest and
coercion.

### Ideological and Religious Theories

Some scholars emphasize ideology's independent role in state formation,
challenging economically deterministic accounts. Many early states
legitimized authority through cosmological claims—divine kingship in
Egypt, the mandate of heaven in China, priestly mediation with gods in
Mesopotamia. Rather than these ideologies merely reflecting underlying
economic relations, religious institutions and beliefs sometimes drove
political centralization.

<a href="David_Graeber" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a>'s **primordial debt theory** proposes that states exploited
pre-existing theological concepts about cosmic indebtedness. In many
cultures, humans supposedly owed debts to gods for creation or
sustenance. Priest-kings positioned themselves as intermediaries who
could manage this debt through tribute, sacrifice, and obedience. This
ideological mechanism preceded and shaped economic extraction rather
than merely justifying it after the fact.[^2]

Graeber's work with
<a href="David_Wengrow" class="wikilink" title="David Wengrow">David
Wengrow</a> in *The Dawn of Everything* challenges the entire enterprise
of seeking single-cause explanations. They document enormous diversity
in how human societies organized themselves historically, with groups
consciously experimenting with different political forms. Rather than
inevitable evolutionary stages, state formation represents contingent
outcomes of specific choices, conflicts, and circumstances.[^3]

This perspective suggests ideology and culture possess genuine causal
autonomy—they don't merely reflect material conditions but actively
shape what becomes possible. If different belief systems enable
different politics, then ideological transformation becomes as important
as economic change for understanding both state formation and potential
alternatives.

### Voluntarist and Agency-Based Theories

<a href="Pierre_Clastres" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre Clastres">Pierre Clastres</a> fundamentally inverted
conventional narratives by arguing many societies actively organized to
**prevent** state formation. Rather than states emerging inevitably from
social complexity, statelessness often required sophisticated social
technologies to maintain.

His studies of Amazonian peoples revealed specific mechanisms: chiefs
who became demanding faced ridicule and mockery; generosity was enforced
through social pressure to prevent wealth concentration; leadership
roles were divided so no individual controlled multiple functions
simultaneously. Most controversially, Clastres argued that low-level
warfare between groups served as deliberate fragmentation, preventing
consolidation of larger political units where chiefs might accumulate
real power.[^4]

Clastres called this the 'refusal of work'. These societies weren't
economically 'underdeveloped'—they produced what they needed with
relatively little labour and consciously rejected intensification that
would require surplus extraction and permanent coordination. The absence
of agriculture or surplus storage wasn't backwardness but political
choice, maintaining autonomy by avoiding dependencies.

<a href="James_C._Scott" class="wikilink" title="James C. Scott">James
C. Scott</a> extended this framework by documenting populations that
deliberately evaded state incorporation. His work on Zomia—the mainland
Southeast Asian highlands—shows how for over two millennia, upland
populations practiced 'escape agriculture' specifically because it
resisted state control. Swidden cultivation and root crops produce less
surplus and are harder to tax than valley rice farming. These peoples
maintained oral rather than written cultures because literacy enables
census-taking and tax records. They practiced geographic mobility and
egalitarian social structures.[^5]

Scott demonstrates that valley states created their own peripheries
through slave-raiding and extraction. Many 'hill tribes' fled from
lowland states in historically documented migrations. These weren't
isolated groups unaware of states—they lived alongside kingdoms, traded
with them, and fully understood state organization. Their statelessness
represented informed choice and continuous effort, not ignorance.

This voluntarist perspective transforms how we understand both state
formation and its absence. States didn't emerge wherever conditions
permitted; they formed in some places and were successfully resisted in
others through conscious social organization. The question becomes what
social technologies enable resistance, and under what conditions they
succeed or fail.

## Historical Examples

### Early State Formation

The earliest known states emerged around 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia (Uruk),
followed by Egypt, the Indus Valley, Shang China, and Mesoamerica. Each
followed different pathways—Mesopotamia through temple economies and
inter-city warfare, Egypt through divine kingship, Mesoamerica through
ceremonial centers and astronomical knowledge. This diversity suggests
multiple sufficient conditions rather than single necessary causes.

Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey (9500 BCE) complicates narratives further.
This massive complex predates agriculture and permanent settlement,
demonstrating that hunter-gatherers could coordinate large-scale
projects without centralized states, challenging the assumed sequence:
agriculture → surplus → complexity → states.

### State Collapse and Reversibility

States have collapsed repeatedly throughout history with populations
surviving and reorganizing. The Bronze Age collapse (circa 1200 BCE),
Maya city abandonment (800-900 CE), and Rome's fall all saw populations
adapt successfully, often with improved health and reduced inequality.
Medieval Europe functioned for centuries with weak or absent central
states, demonstrating that complex coordination doesn't require state
structures.

This reversibility matters theoretically. States require constant
reproduction through institutions, ideology, and violence. When those
maintenance systems fail, statelessness returns as a viable option,
suggesting states are more fragile and contingent than they appear.

### Persistent Stateless Societies

Australian Aboriginal societies maintained diverse organizational
systems for over 65,000 years without developing agriculture, surplus
storage, or states. They practiced sophisticated land management,
maintained continent-spanning trade networks, and created rich
ceremonial traditions—the longest continuous cultural development in
human history, achieved entirely without state structures.

The <a href="Haudenosaunee" class="wikilink"
title="Haudenosaunee">Haudenosaunee</a> (Iroquois) Confederacy
coordinated five (later six) nations through a sophisticated federal
system. Women's councils held veto power, consensus-based
decision-making required unanimous agreement for major decisions, and no
permanent coercive authority existed. The system maintained peace for
centuries, demonstrating that complex political coordination needn't
involve state monopolies on violence.

Northwest Coast Indigenous peoples combined substantial surplus, clear
social stratification including slavery, and complex property systems,
yet centralized states never emerged. This directly contradicts
predictions that surplus plus class divisions necessitate state
enforcement.

### Colonial Imposition

The majority of contemporary states formed through colonial imposition
rather than internal development. European powers drew borders (often
deliberately dividing ethnic groups), installed administrative systems,
and created centralized authorities. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885
partitioned Africa with no African input, creating artificial states
bearing no relationship to existing social organization.

Post-colonial states inherited these structures almost entirely intact,
contributing to ongoing legitimacy crises. This historical reality
cannot be explained by theories emphasizing internal economic
development or evolutionary stages—these states formed through external
conquest for extraction.

## Tendencies

Current scholarship increasingly rejects unilinear evolutionary models
in favor of multilinear approaches recognizing diverse pathways. The
question has shifted from 'how do states form?' to 'under what varied
conditions do states sometimes form, and why do they sometimes not form
or collapse?'

Debates continue over material versus ideological factors, with evidence
for both positions in different cases. The tension between voluntarism
and determinism remains unresolved. Most scholars now adopt middle
positions: agency operates within structural constraints, but those
constraints are looser and less deterministic than previously assumed.

David Graeber and David Wengrow argue for fundamental indeterminacy.
They document such enormous variation in how human societies organized
themselves—groups consciously experimenting with different political
forms, sometimes alternating seasonally between hierarchical and
egalitarian structures—that generalizations become suspect. Their
conclusion is that humans have always possessed political
self-consciousness and creativity, making specific choices whose
outcomes depended on particular circumstances rather than evolutionary
laws.

This theoretical pluralism reflects empirical complexity but creates
challenges for political practice. If no general theory explains state
formation, diverse contexts require diverse approaches, with no
universal formula. Understanding multiple pathways of state formation
suggests multiple pathways of resistance and abolition, adapted to
specific material, cultural, and historical circumstances.

## Criticism

From an anarchist perspective, theories of state formation that present
states as inevitable or beneficial obscure the reality of how states
actually emerged and function. Social contract theories serve as
legitimating myths rather than historical explanations. Even materialist
theories that correctly identify exploitation often assume state
structures are necessary for complex coordination, ignoring extensive
evidence of sophisticated stateless societies.

The focus on explaining how states formed can itself be problematic,
suggesting they represent a natural or necessary development. Anarchist
analysis emphasizes that states formed through violence and coercion,
require constant maintenance through ideology and force, and have
repeatedly collapsed without catastrophic consequences. The relevant
questions are not why states formed, but how they maintain themselves
and how they can be abolished.
