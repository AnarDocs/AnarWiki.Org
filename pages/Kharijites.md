Currents of the Islamic sect of the Kharijites have historically opposed
state rule, leading people to compare them to anarchists. For example,
Patricia Crone included the Kharijite subsect of the Najdiyya in a *Past
and Present* article titled "Ninth-Century Muslim Anarchists."[^1]
*Wikipedia* claims, "An early example of anti-authoritarianism in Islam
is the movement of the Khawarij."[^2] On social issues such as gender
and sexuality, the Kharijites were not necessarily any more egalitarian
than were other Muslims, Jews, and Christians of their time. And their
historic "fanatical" opposition to all other Muslims has led mainstream
sheikhs to liken them to present-day far-right groups such as Daesh
(ISIS) and Al Qaeda.[^3] However, this comparison overlooks the fact
that the Najdiyya subsect of ninth-century Iraqi Kharijism, at least,
opposed all forms of government. Moreover, despite their theoretically
intolerant views, the Najdiyya "seem to have lived in perfect amity with
their so-called infidel neighbors."[^4]

Kharijites were known for their intense piety, and the historian Fred M.
Donner argues that the Kharijites "represented the survival in its
purest form of the original pietistic impetus" of Muhammad's original
followers.[^5]

Kharijites emerged in the seventh century CE during the First Civil War
between believers in Muhammad's teachings (that crystallized at some
point into the religion of Islam). When the prophet Muhammad died, he
was succeeded by the first Caliph (Islamic ruler) Abu Bakr, then by the
second Caliph Umar, and by a third Caliph Uthman. Uthman was accused of
corruption and was assassinated in 656 CE, sparking a Civil War over the
question of who should be the next Caliph. The side that favored
Muawiyah became known as Sunnis, and the side that favored Ali,
Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, became known as Shiites. A much
smaller sect, the Kharijites, meaning seceders, broke off from the
Shiites. They may have been disillusioned in Ali's reported intentions
to negotiate with Muawiyah. In any case, the Kharijites opposed both
sides of the Civil War, and members launched assassination attempts
against both Muawiyah and Ali. They did kill Ali, bringing the Civil War
to an end in 661.[^6]

# Najdiyya

The Najdiyya subsect of Kharijism appear to be the first Muslim group to
collectively reject the necessity of a state. Emerging in revolt in the
seventh-century, they argued that full consensus among a community was
impossible and that no state could be legitimate. They said that even
the first caliph Abu Bakr had been illegitimate since he was not
universally supported. They also opposed contemporary post-caliphate
local rulers known as imams. Because the Najdiyya considered large-scale
consensus (*ijma*) impossible, they rejected law itself since no
community could be expected to reach full consensus over any set of
laws. Patricia Crone summarizes, "Najdite Islam was a do-it-yourself
religion. Politically *and* intellectually a Najdite would have no
master apart from God."[^7]
