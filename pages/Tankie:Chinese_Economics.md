  they are capitalist / neoliberal
- Keywords to search: "996 work culture", "Foxconn Suicides", "農民工",
  "低端人口", "三和大神"
- “This person does not grasp class struggle; he has never referred to
  this key link. Still his theme of ‘white cat, black cat,’ making no
  distinction between imperialism and Marxism.”- Mao Zedong on Deng
  Xiaoping
