# Kyriarchy

## Overview

**Kyriarchy** is a framework for understanding interlocking systems of
domination —
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>,
white supremacy, <a href="heteronormativity" class="wikilink"
title="heteronormativity">heteronormativity</a>, cisnormativity,
ableism, and others — not as separate problems but as a single
interconnected structure of hierarchy. The term was coined by feminist
theologian <a href="Elisabeth_Schüssler_Fiorenza" class="wikilink"
title="Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza">Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza</a> in
1992, derived from the Greek *kyrios* (lord, master) and *archō* (to
rule). Where
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
names only the domination of men over women, kyriarchy describes a
"complex pyramidal system" in which any individual may be privileged
within one hierarchy while oppressed within another, and in which those
at the base of the pyramid bear the combined weight of multiple,
mutually reinforcing oppressions.[^1]

From an anarchist perspective, kyriarchy is not simply a useful academic
term — it names what anarchists have long argued: that no single axis of
domination can be fought in isolation, and that any genuinely liberatory
project must take on the whole structure of hierarchical power, not
merely one face of it.

The concept overlaps substantially with what writer and philosopher
<a href="Terence_McKenna" class="wikilink"
title="Terence McKenna">Terence McKenna</a> called **dominator culture**
— a term he drew from
<a href="Riane_Eisler" class="wikilink" title="Riane Eisler">Riane
Eisler</a>'s work to describe a society organised around fear, force,
and the imperative to control, as opposed to what Eisler called the
partnership model.

## Origins

### Schüssler Fiorenza and feminist theology

Schüssler Fiorenza developed kyriarchy as a corrective to the term
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>,
which she found too narrow. Patriarchy names a system in which men
dominate women, but it does not adequately account for the ways that
race, class, sexuality, religion, and age also structure relations of
domination. A wealthy white woman dominates in some relationships; a
poor Black man is oppressed in most. Kyriarchy describes the full
pyramid: a system in which privilege and oppression are distributed
unevenly across multiple axes, where positions of relative power become
the lens through which other oppressions are experienced, and where the
whole structure is held in place by "education, socialisation, and brute
violence."[^2]

Crucially, Schüssler Fiorenza describes kyriarchy not as a fixed
hierarchy with a single point of domination, but as a system that
reproduces itself through
<a href="internalized_oppression" class="wikilink"
title="internalized oppression">internalized oppression</a> — those with
relative power tend to stay there, those without tend to remain
excluded, and the structures of oppression amplify one another.

### Riane Eisler and dominator culture

Independently of Schüssler Fiorenza,
<a href="Riane_Eisler" class="wikilink" title="Riane Eisler">Riane
Eisler</a> developed the concept of **dominator culture** in her 1987
book *The Chalice and the Blade*.[^3] Eisler contrasts dominator culture
with what she calls the partnership model. Dominator societies are
organised around authoritarian structures, rigid hierarchies, high
tolerance for violence, and belief systems that naturalise all of the
above. Partnership societies, by contrast, are democratic, non-violent,
and built on genuine equality rather than enforced submission.

Eisler argued that dominator culture is not an eternal feature of human
society. Archaeological evidence, she contended, points to extensive
Neolithic partnership societies that preceded the emergence of
patriarchal and warlike social formations. Domination, on this reading,
is not human nature — it is a social technology imposed and maintained
by force.

<a href="Terence_McKenna" class="wikilink"
title="Terence McKenna">Terence McKenna</a> took up Eisler's framework
and extended it into a broader cultural critique, arguing that Western
civilisation as a whole operates as a dominator culture: alienated from
nature, from each other, and from the deeper possibilities of human
experience. For McKenna, dominator culture "is based upon our alienation
from nature, from ourselves, and from each other."[^4]

### The anarchist adoption of intersectionality

The concept of <a href="intersectionality" class="wikilink"
title="intersectionality">intersectionality</a> — developed by Kimberlé
Crenshaw,
<a href="bell_hooks" class="wikilink" title="bell hooks">bell hooks</a>,
Audre Lorde, and others — is the theoretical companion to kyriarchy.
Where kyriarchy names the system, intersectionality describes how
individuals experience it: each person sits at the intersection of
multiple hierarchies, privileged by some and oppressed by others, with
those positions shaping each other in specific ways.

The <a href="Anarchist_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist Federation">Anarchist Federation</a> (UK) has argued
that kyriarchy is particularly useful for anarchists precisely because
it allows class struggle to remain central without treating other
oppressions as secondary or derivative. As their Women's Caucus put it:
"Just as sexism and racism divide class struggle, capitalism and racism
divide gender struggles, and sexism and capitalism divide race
struggles. All systems of oppression divide the struggles against all
the other systems that they intersect with."[^5]

## Tendencies

### Kyriarchy and anarchist class analysis

A recurring tension within anarchist thought is how to hold economic
class analysis alongside other axes of oppression without either
collapsing one into the other or treating them as simply parallel. The
kyriarchy framework offers one answer: capitalism operates differently
from patriarchy or white supremacy in that the ruling class is an
active, necessary oppressor — it cannot benefit from exploitation
passively or unwillingly in the way that, say, a white person may
benefit from white privilege without choosing to. The ruling class must
be an active oppressor to remain the ruling class. This means that while
kyriarchy names all oppressions as interconnected, class struggle
retains a specific character: it is not about dismantling a cultural
identity but about seizing the means of production from those who use
them to exploit everyone else.

However — and this is the anarchist contribution — this does not make
economic class *primary* and the others *secondary*.
<a href="Patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="Patriarchy">Patriarchy</a>
pre-dates capitalism. A post-capitalist society could still be sexist,
racist, and heteronormative. The AF's analysis is direct on this point:
"anarchists are opposed to all systems of oppression... other
oppressions won't melt away 'after the revolution'."[^6] If the
revolution is built on a movement that reproduces the oppressions it
claims to oppose, the result will not be liberation.

### The mega-machine and kyriarchal creorder

Daniel Baryon, in *A Modern Anarchism*, extends the kyriarchal analysis
through the concept of the **mega-machine** — the interlocking apparatus
of state, capital, and cultural domination that organises society in the
interests of those at the top. Drawing on Bichler and Nitzan's theory of
Capital as Power, Baryon argues that the goal of hierarchical power is
not simply profit but *differential accumulation*: maintaining and
expanding power relative to all rivals, which requires constantly
reordering society — what they call **creorder** — to keep the
gatekeepers in place.[^7]

On this reading, kyriarchy is not a collection of separate prejudices
but a unified creordering force. Each hierarchy — racial, gendered,
economic, national — serves the function of simplifying and stratifying
social reality to keep it legible and manageable to those at the top,
while the complexity and autonomy of those at the bottom is
systematically suppressed. James C. Scott's observation that states
necessarily simplify and flatten the societies they govern applies here:
hierarchical power demands legibility, and legibility means reducing
human lives to categories the machine can process and control.[^8]

Baryon argues that kyriarchal systems do not merely oppress — they
actively seek to transform the desires of those they dominate, so that
people come to want their own subjugation and participate in the
domination of others. This is why dismantling the system requires more
than changing policies or removing individual bad actors: it requires
rebuilding social relations from the ground up.

### Privilege, not guilt

The <a href="Anarchist_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist Federation">Anarchist Federation</a>'s analysis of
privilege is worth dwelling on, because it addresses a common objection.
Acknowledging privilege is not about guilt. You are not responsible for
the system that grants you advantages you did not ask for. What you are
responsible for is how you respond to it. Privileged groups — with the
exception of the ruling class, who are active oppressors — have a
genuine and necessary role in struggles against the systems that
privilege them. That role is not leadership. It is solidarity:
listening, following the lead of those most affected, and working to
dismantle the structures that divide us.

The AF is also clear that privilege theory does not require abandoning
class struggle — it requires doing class struggle better. "The more we
can make alliances over the oppressions that have been used to divide
us, the more we can unite against the forces that exploit us all."[^9]

### Autonomous organisation

One practical implication of the kyriarchy framework is the necessity of
autonomous organisation by oppressed groups. This is not separatism for
its own sake — it is a recognition that the presence of privilege within
a group, however unintentional, shapes what can be said, heard, and
acted upon. People need spaces free from the dynamics of their own
oppression in order to think and organise clearly. The AF's Aims and
Principles acknowledge this: autonomous organisation within oppressed
groups is not a retreat from solidarity but a precondition for it.

## Criticism

### From within anarchism

Some anarchists, particularly those with a more orthodox class-struggle
focus, have argued that the language of privilege can obscure structural
analysis by shifting attention from systems to identities. The concern
is that privilege theory, in liberal hands, tends toward individual
consciousness-raising rather than collective action — producing what
might be called an endless audit of personal complicity rather than a
movement that challenges power.

The AF's response to this is direct: privilege theory does not come with
compulsory liberalism any more than class struggle comes with compulsory
Leninism. The framework is a tool, and its use depends on who wields it
and toward what ends. Radical class struggle anarchists can and should
use it to build stronger, more united movements — not to substitute
identity politics for structural analysis, but to ensure that structural
analysis does not reproduce the hierarchies it claims to oppose.

### From liberal feminism

Kyriarchy has also been used in liberal and reformist contexts in ways
that anarchists find inadequate. When corporations promote diversity
initiatives, or when states appoint women and people of colour to
positions of power within fundamentally exploitative institutions, they
invoke the language of intersectionality without challenging any of the
underlying structures. A woman prime minister does no more for
working-class women than a male prime minister does for working-class
men. Tokenism within hierarchy is not liberation from hierarchy.

### The "Oppression Olympics" objection

A persistent objection to intersectional analysis is that it creates a
ranking of oppressions — that naming multiple axes of domination leads
to competition over who is most oppressed, and thus who has the most
legitimate voice. The kyriarchy framework explicitly rejects this. There
is no points system. The value of intersectional analysis is not that it
establishes a hierarchy of suffering but that it reveals how different
forms of oppression interact, where struggles connect, and where the
most effective interventions can be made. As Selma James put it: "Our
purpose here is not parallels. We are seeking to describe that complex
interweaving of forces which is the working class."[^10]
