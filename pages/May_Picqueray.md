from 1974 to 1983.

## Family

A feminist before her time, May Picqueray lived as an independent woman
without depriving herself of having a family. She therefore raised her
three children, born of three different fathers, alone. Married in
<a href="Saint-Nazaire" class="wikilink"
title="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> on 22 July 1916, to Fred
Schneyder, of Dutch nationality, she separated three weeks later. In
1923, she gave birth to a daughter, Sonia, conceived during her trip to
the Soviet Union with Lucien Chevalier, federal secretary of the Metal
Federation. Then in August 1930, she married François Niel and had a
son, Lucien. Finally, in 1941, in the midst of the war, she gave birth
to a daughter, Marie-May, whom she conceived with Isaac Gilman, a
Biel-Russian Jew who had taken refuge in Toulouse.

## Early Life

Attracted in her youth to revolutionary circles, May Picqueray left
France for <a href="Moscow" class="wikilink" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>,
<a href="Russia" class="wikilink" title="Russia">Russia</a>, in 1922, as
a delegate of the Metalworkers union, which was at the time part of the
<a href="Profintern" class="wikilink"
title="Red Trade Union International">Red Trade Union International</a>.
While she was in Moscow, she notably climbed on the table to denounce
union congregants eating while the common people starved.[^1] She also
visited <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, who was already weakened by
the disease that eventually killed him. Because of
<a href="Leon_Trotsky" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a>'s responsibility in the crushing of the
<a href="Kronstadt_rebellion" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, and his perceived
betrayal of
<a href="Nestor_Makhno" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a>, she refused to shake his hand when she met him, even as she
asked him to release the anarchists locked in prison by the
<a href="Bolsheviks" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>.[^2]

In 1924, she made the punch at the meeting of the Grange-aux-Belles
during which the communists killed two anarchist workers with revolvers.
Her friendship with
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> and <a href="Alexander_Berkman" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> as well as her trip to
the USSR confirmed the dictatorial character of the communist regime,
even though
<a href="Joseph_Stalin" class="wikilink" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> was
not yet at the head of the country.

## Adulthood

In 1921, two anarchists of Italian origin,
<a href="Sacco_and_Vanzetti" class="wikilink"
title="Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti">Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo
Vanzetti</a>, were condemned to death by the American justice system,
while shouting their innocence. Despite the mobilization of the
left-wing circles, the French press remained silent. To trigger the
press campaign, May Picqueray sent a parcel bomb containing a defensive
grenade and leaflets to the American embassy. This "initiative"
succeeded in mobilizing the journalists, without causing any damage
other than material. Despite the magnitude of the worldwide
demonstrations in their favor, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in
1927 - and rehabilitated in 1978.

Picqueray joined the "Spanish Children's Aid Committee" where her
activity consisted of transporting Spanish orphans and reuniting the
scattered family members separated by the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink" title="Spanish war">Spanish
war</a>. She was in
<a href="Toulouse" class="wikilink" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> at the
time of the Debacle where she was in charge of welcoming refugees. Then
she was in charge of supplying the French concentration camps of
<a href="Camp_de_Noé" class="wikilink" title="Noé">Noé</a> and
<a href="Camp_Vernet" class="wikilink" title="Vernet">Vernet</a>, from
where she managed to escape nine internees. Her resistance activity
consisted mainly in making false papers, in association with

title="Madeleine Lamberet">Madeleine Lamberet</a>, for all those who
needed them.

A friend of
<a href="Louis_Lecoin" class="wikilink" title="Louis Lecoin">Louis

life as an activist after his death.

An enthusiastic participant in the

service.[^3]
