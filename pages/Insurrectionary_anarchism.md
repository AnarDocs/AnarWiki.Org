# Insurrectionary Anarchism

## Overview

**Insurrectionary anarchism** (also known as **insurrectionism**) is a
revolutionary theory and practice within the
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
movement that distinguishes itself from other anarchist tendencies
primarily through its approach to struggle rather than through distinct
ideological positions. While sharing the fundamental anarchist
opposition to
<a href="hierarchy" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>,
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
and the <a href="state" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>,
insurrectionary anarchism is characterized by its emphasis on immediate
action, rejection of formal organization, and focus on attack as a
method of resistance.[^1]

Insurrectionary anarchism is associated with several key practices and
concepts: the critique of formal organization, advocacy of informal
organization through <a href="affinity_groups" class="wikilink"
title="affinity groups">affinity groups</a>, emphasis on attack and
direct action, commitment to permanent
<a href="class_conflict" class="wikilink" title="class conflict">class

<a href="illegalism" class="wikilink" title="illegalism">illegalism</a>,
and refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.[^2]

## Origins

### The Stirnerite Foundation

The theoretical foundation of insurrectionary anarchism can be traced to
<a href="Max_Stirner" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">Max
Stirner</a>'s 1845 work *<a href="The_Ego_and_Its_Own" class="wikilink"
title="The Ego and Its Own">The Ego and Its Own</a>*, which presented a
crucial distinction between "revolution" and "insurrection":

> "Revolution and insurrection must not be looked upon as synonymous.
> The former consists in an overturning of conditions, of the
> established condition or status, the State or society, and is
> accordingly a political or social act; the latter has indeed for its
> unavoidable consequence a transformation of circumstances, yet does
> not start from it but from men's discontent with themselves, is not an
> armed rising, but a rising of individuals, a getting up, without
> regard to the arrangements that spring from it. The Revolution aimed
> at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves
> be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets no glittering hopes on
> "institutions."[^3]

For Stirner, revolution seeks to establish new social arrangements
through state power, while insurrection begins with individual
discontent and the refusal to be arranged by others. This distinction
became foundational to insurrectionary anarchist thought, emphasizing
immediate practice over future-oriented revolutionary waiting.

### Propaganda of the Deed

During the 1870s, <a href="Anarchism_in_Italy" class="wikilink"
title="Italian anarchists">Italian anarchists</a> developed the concept
of "<a href="propaganda_of_the_deed" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>" - the idea
that small
<a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
actions</a> could inspire others to carry out their own acts of
insurrection. Insurrectionists viewed every riot or rebellion as
"revolutionary gymnastics" that could lead to generalized
<a href="social_revolution" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a>.[^4]

This theory drove a wave of high-profile political assassinations during
the 1890s by Italian individualist anarchists, including the killings of
French President
<a href="Sadi_Carnot" class="wikilink" title="Sadi Carnot">Sadi

## Historical Development

### The Galleanist Movement

<a href="Luigi_Galleani" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Galleani">Luigi
Galleani</a>, an Italian immigrant to the United States, became a major
proponent of insurrectionary anarchism in North America through his
newspaper *<a href="Cronaca_Sovversiva" class="wikilink"
title="Cronaca Sovversiva">Cronaca Sovversiva</a>*. Galleani was a
staunch anti-organizationalist who opposed anarchist participation in
labor unions, which he viewed as displaying reformist tendencies and
susceptibility to corruption.[^5]

Galleani merged
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>'s concept of
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
with a commitment to unfettered insurgency, defending
<a href="anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> against
<a href="authoritarian_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian socialism">authoritarian socialism</a> and
reformism while emphasizing spontaneity, autonomy, direct action and
self-determination. He saw no contradiction between individual and
social struggle, nor between communism and anarchism - firmly opposing
the authoritarian collectivism that would subordinate individuals to
organized collectives.[^6]

The <a href="Galleanisti" class="wikilink"
title="Galleanisti">Galleanisti</a> (Galleani's followers) organized in
small, close-knit cells and carried out various acts of propaganda by
the deed, including bombing campaigns. Following
<a href="World_War_I" class="wikilink" title="World War I">World War
I</a> and during the
<a href="First_Red_Scare" class="wikilink" title="First Red Scare">First
Red Scare</a>, Galleanist groups conducted a
<a href="1919_United_States_anarchist_bombings" class="wikilink"
title="bombing campaign">bombing campaign</a> that sent letter bombs to
various industrialists, politicians and lawyers, though most failed to
reach their targets.[^7]

### Italian Resurgence

Insurrectionary anarchism re-emerged within the Italian anarchist
movement during the <a href="Years_of_Lead_(Italy)" class="wikilink"
title="Years of Lead">Years of Lead</a> in the 1970s. In 1977,
<a href="Alfredo_Bonanno" class="wikilink"
title="Alfredo Bonanno">Alfredo Bonanno</a> published *Armed Joy*, which
advocated revolutionary violence, critiqued wage labor, and emphasized
joy in struggle. Despite imprisonment and state orders to destroy all
copies, Bonanno continued producing insurrectionist texts.[^8]

During the 1980s and 1990s, Italian insurrectionary anarchists began
carrying out attacks on infrastructure, escalating from vandalism to
bombings and assaults. Between 1999 and 2003, four insurrectionist
groups merged to form the
<a href="Informal_Anarchist_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Informal Anarchist Federation">Informal Anarchist Federation</a>
(FAI), which has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks across
Italy and internationally.[^9]

### Contemporary Practice

The Italian insurrectionary anarchist scene exists as an informal
network centered around occupied spaces and publications, distinguishing
itself from platformist organizations like the Italian Anarchist
Federation. Similar movements developed in Greece, notably the
<a href="Conspiracy_of_Cells_of_Fire" class="wikilink"
title="Conspiracy of Cells of Fire">Conspiracy of Cells of Fire</a>,
which joined with the FAI to form what they called the "Black
International."[^10]

In the United States, insurrectionary anarchist ideas influenced groups
like <a href="Up_Against_the_Wall_Motherfucker" class="wikilink"
title="Up Against the Wall Motherfucker">Up Against the Wall
Motherfucker</a> and later informed anarchist participation in the
<a href="Occupy_movement" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy movement">Occupy movement</a>, though often creating
tensions with activists promoting
<a href="civil_disobedience" class="wikilink"
title="civil disobedience">civil disobedience</a> and
<a href="prefigurative_politics" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a>.[^11]

## Theory and Practice

### Critique of Formal Organization

Insurrectionary anarchists reject formal organizations - including
anarchist federations, political parties, and traditional labor unions -
viewing them as tending toward hierarchy, bureaucracy, and the
alienation of power from those in struggle. They critique the way
permanent organizations develop their own institutional interests in
self-preservation, causing the organization itself to become an end
rather than a means.[^12]

The emergence of "organizers" who speak for the "masses" represents a
fundamental problem in formal organization. These organizers position
themselves above those they claim to represent, transforming active
participants into a passive mass to be mobilized. Decision-making power
moves from the moment of action into organizational structures, stifling
initiative and autonomous action.[^13]

### Informal Organization

Rather than formal structures, insurrectionary anarchists advocate
informal organization based on
<a href="affinity_groups" class="wikilink"
title="affinity groups">affinity groups</a> - small, voluntary
associations of individuals who know and trust each other through shared
analysis and practical experience in struggle. These groups form and
dissolve as needed, without permanent structures or official
membership.[^14]

Informal organization is characterized by:

- **Autonomy** - Decisions made by those involved in action at the
  moment they are needed, rather than predetermined by organizational
  bodies
- **No Compromise** - Refusal to negotiate with or accept concessions
  from institutions of domination
- **Permanent Conflict** - Maintaining antagonistic stance toward the
  existing order without mediation
- **Affinity** - Unity built through practical collaboration and
  political clarity rather than formal programs[^15]

This organizational model is sometimes compared to "leaderless
resistance," though insurrectionary anarchists emphasize
self-organization in struggle rather than isolated individual action.
The model resists infiltration through its compartmentalized structure
but can face challenges of isolation and the development of informal
hierarchies.[^16]

### Attack and Direct Action

Insurrectionary anarchism places particular importance on attack -
immediate destructive action against structures of domination rather
than defensive or reactive struggle. Attack can take various forms, from
vandalism of infrastructure to targeted actions against specific
institutions or individuals.[^17]

The practice of attack is not viewed merely as instrumental but also as
a source of joy and a means of self-empowerment. Insurrectionary
anarchists describe participation in direct action as moments of fully
realized life, breaking free from the constrained existence imposed by
capitalism and the state.[^18]

However, the strength of insurrection is understood as social rather
than military. The measure of success is not armed confrontation but the
extent of disruption to normal capitalist functioning - strikes,
occupations, and the paralysis of economic activity prove more powerful
than spectacular violence.[^19]

### Intermediate Struggles

While revolution remains the constant reference point, insurrectionary
anarchists recognize the importance of "intermediate struggles" -
circumscribed conflicts with specific objectives arising from particular
problems. These might include resistance to prison construction,
military bases, genetically modified crops, high-speed rail projects, or
other specific capitalist developments.[^20]

The key is that such struggles must:

- Spread autonomously rather than being managed by organizations
- Maintain permanent conflict without negotiation
- Remain self-managed by participants
- Focus on attack rather than defense of interests[^21]

The transition from intermediate struggles to revolution cannot be
guaranteed in advance, but even limited conflicts can have unexpected
consequences and contribute to building insurrectionary capacity.

### Revolutionary Solidarity

Revolutionary solidarity goes beyond symbolic support or fundraising to
involve active attack against common enemies. When comrades face
repression or when communities resist domination, insurrectionary
anarchists practice solidarity through direct action against the
institutions responsible.[^22]

This creates links between geographically separated struggles,
demonstrates common interests across different contexts, and takes local
struggles to an international level. Revolutionary solidarity is itself
a form of attack that multiplies the active powers of all involved.

## Relationship to Social Anarchism

The debate between insurrectionary anarchists and social anarchists
(including <a href="platformism" class="wikilink"
title="platformists">platformists</a> and
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalists">anarcho-syndicalists</a>) has sometimes
been characterized as a conflict between individualism and collectivism,
or between anti-organizationalism and organization. However, this
framing misrepresents both positions.[^23]

Insurrectionary anarchists are not opposed to organization as such -
they organize extensively through affinity groups, coordinated actions,
and informal networks. The disagreement concerns the means and forms of
organization rather than its principle. As
<a href="Errico_Malatesta" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> argued, even anarchists
most hostile to organization "organise just like the rest of us and
often more effectively" when they want to accomplish something.[^24]

Similarly, the tension between individual and social struggle is often
overstated.
<a href="Luigi_Galleani" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Galleani">Luigi
Galleani</a> saw no contradiction between the two, understanding that
individual desires for self-determination necessarily lead to social
struggle against the collective structures of domination. The
insurrectional project grows from individual desire to live free but
must confront the existing social order that prevents this freedom.[^25]

### Autonomous Base Nuclei

When intervening in mass struggles, insurrectionary anarchists encourage
the formation of autonomous base nuclei - self-managed grassroots
organizations independent from political parties and union
bureaucracies. These autonomous structures embody the principles of
direct action, permanent conflict, and workers' self-management.[^26]

Historical examples include the self-managed leagues created to fight
the U.S. missile base in Comiso, Sicily, and the Autonomous Movement of
Railway Workers in Turin. These organizations differ from union front
groups in that they remain genuinely autonomous, with anarchists
participating as equals rather than as vanguard leaders.[^27]

This approach shares similarities with contemporary "direct unionism"
and "solidarity network" models that organize workers to fight their own
struggles outside traditional union structures.

## Critique of Syndicalism

Insurrectionary anarchists offer a radical critique of syndicalist
methods, viewing labor unions and anarcho-syndicalist organizations as
historically trapped in reformism despite revolutionary rhetoric.
However, this does not translate to a project of destroying existing
unions or avoiding them entirely.[^28]

As <a href="Alfredo_Bonanno" class="wikilink"
title="Alfredo Bonanno">Alfredo Bonanno</a> argued, rather than
expending energy on destructive campaigns against unions,
insurrectionary anarchists should bring their radical critique into
union spaces and work toward building more class-wide structures that
transcend workplace-only organizing. The goal is not to abandon mass
organization but to develop forms that maintain autonomy, refuse
compromise, and focus on attack rather than defense.[^29]

## Criticisms and Debates

Insurrectionary anarchism has faced various criticisms from other
anarchist tendencies:

- **Isolation** - The emphasis on small affinity groups and informal
  organization can lead to insularity and difficulty scaling up struggle
- **Substitutionism** - Critics argue that small group actions can
  substitute for mass movements rather than contributing to their
  development
- **Adventurism** - The focus on immediate attack is sometimes
  criticized as prioritizing spectacular actions over sustained
  organizing
- **Anti-organizational dogmatism** - Some insurrectionary anarchists
  are accused of treating informal organization as an ideological
  principle rather than a practical choice[^30]

Defenders respond that these criticisms often misunderstand
insurrectionary practice. Informal organization is meant to be chosen
based on effectiveness for specific goals, not applied dogmatically. The
focus on immediate action aims to develop capacity for insurrection
through practice rather than waiting for ideal conditions. And small
group actions are intended to inspire and spread, not to substitute for
broader social movements.[^31]

## Contemporary Relevance

Insurrectionary anarchist ideas and practices have influenced various
contemporary movements:

- Anti-globalization protests and
  <a href="black_bloc" class="wikilink" title="black bloc">black bloc</a>
  tactics
- <a href="Occupy_movement" class="wikilink"
  title="Occupy movement">Occupy movement</a> practices of autonomous
  direct action
- Resistance to ecological destruction through groups like
  <a href="Earth_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
  title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a>
- Anti-fascist organizing emphasizing immediate confrontation
- Prison abolition movements focusing on attack rather than reform[^32]

The emphasis on immediate practice, rejection of mediation, autonomous
organization, and permanent conflict continues to resonate with
anarchists seeking alternatives to both authoritarian party politics and
reformist activism.
