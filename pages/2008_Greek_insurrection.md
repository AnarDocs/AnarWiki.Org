On 6 December 2008, 15 year-old anarchist Alexis Grigoropoulos was
confronted and killed by two cops in Exarcheia, Athens, the stronghold
of the country's anarchist movement. Within an hour, anarchists began
clashing with the police, and attacking banks and luxury shops. Riots
spread across the country. Universities were occupied for a month. The
Void Network's Tasos Sagris estimates that more than 100,000 people
participated in the December insurrection.[^1] A majority of
participants were anarchists, and around 30 percent were first-time
rioters. Thousands were students, migrants, and Romani residents.[^2]

Insurrectionists were organized in hundreds of tightly-knit affinity
groups and some belonged to organizations including the
Antiauthoritarian Movement. Coordination largely took place through
mobile phones, and *Indymedia* served as an important hub for
announcements.[^3]

Despite being prompted by a police murder, the uprising targeted much
more than the police, focusing on the State and the entire capitalist
world-system. A statement in the Greek anarchist magazine *Flesh
Machine* evaluated: "This revolt was, in fact, a rebellion against
property and alienation. A revolt of the gift against the sovereignty of
money. An insurrection of anarchy, of use value against the democracy of
exchange value. A spontaneous rising of collective freedom against the
rationality of individual discipline."[^4] "We will not dialogue with
the State, we will not sit down to chat with Capital. We will not tell
them what we want because they already know: we want them to die," wrote
A.G. Schwarz in a defense of the movement's refusal to make demands.[^5]

At the student occupation of Polytechnic University, people made
decisions at a general assembly. Occupiers opened the kitchen and dining
hall and served meals to anyone who came to eat. Groups went out every
day to expropriate food from supermarkets and bring it to the
kitchen.[^6]

The insurrection set off many more years of protest. People around the
country set up social centers and community gardens. Riots continued. A
dog named Loukaninos, known as the "riot dog," ran alongside the
protesters at many demonstrations, barking at riot police and, according
to some reports, even kicking tear gas canisters back at them.[^7]

At Greece's Skouries forest, anarchists and other community members
established a blockade against the Canadian gold-mining company Eldorado
Gold, which planned to clear-cut old-growth forest and build a massive
open-pit gold and copper mine, an underground mine, and a processing
mine. Mining trucks and bulldozers were torched.[^8]

In January 2015, the country elected the social democratic political
party SYRIZA, which had participated in the protests. Upon taking power,
this party quickly bowed to the interest of neoliberal capitalism. In a
referendum held on 5 July 2015, Greeks voted against accepting austerity
policies that the European Union wanted to impose on Greece. A week
later, the SYRIZA government agreed to a deal similar to the one voters
had just rejected. Observing the undemocratic result and Syriza's
recuperation of the insurrection, the social theorist John Holloway
argued once a movement enters government, "the conflicts move from the
cities to the state, from the streets to the closed rooms of inter-state
negotiation."[^9] Although the SYRIZA government temporarily banned the
gold mining at Skouries, a Greek court decision in the autumn of 2015
allowed the mining to resume.[^10] The government has since come to
support the mining. According to *Vice*, "The current left-wing Syriza
government was in staunch opposition to any mine expansions when it came
into power in 2015, but had to change its tune as the International
Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and European Commission, or
troika, forced Greece to streamline investment processes, including
environmental assessments."[^11]

On 22 May 2017, the *New York Times* reported that, "Anarchists Fill
Services Void Left by Faltering Greek Governance." Anarchists were
running some 250 community centers, providing homes to Syrian refugees,
distributing food and medicine, and patrolling neighborhoods to stop
drug sales.[^12]

# Critique

John Holloway suggests that the Greek insurrection's hyper-focus on
resistance in the years since 2008 may have been less effective than a
focus on reconstruction. That's because the state has largely come to
ignore insurrectionary violence, according to this theory:

> If you think of Greece in 2011 and the extraordinary demonstrations
> there, in which so many buildings in the center were burned down – the
> state just carries on regardless. I think it’s very interesting and
> possibly very important in terms of future directions, because the
> power of attraction of state-centered politics and protests really
> depends upon the state having some sort of room for negotiation with
> the trade unions and with people protesting. If the state feels there
> is no longer any room for negotiation, or simply gets into the habit
> of saying ‘we will absolutely not negotiate’, then that closes down
> the margin for state-centered Left politics and pushes people more
> towards the idea that, really, trying to do things through the state
> is absolutely hopeless. So perhaps we can hope that non-state oriented
> politics will become more and more common and more widespread
> throughout society.[^13]

Gelderloos reflects:

> In Greece, after the 2008 insurrection when people burned every police
> station and bank in the country, in the following years social
> movements took advantage of the change in the balance of powers to
> create hundreds of autonomous spaces, to improve people’s access to
> healthcare and encourage neighborhood self-organization against rising
> rents, and help refugees survive the violence of borders and
> criminalization. The progressive political party Syriza also took
> advantage of the situation to win the elections, while the combined
> forces of the European Central Bank and the IMF did their best to
> destroy the Greek economy and force the country into poverty in an
> attempt to crush the social movements with precarity, using the weapon
> of debt restructuring they had honed over the prior decades in the
> Global South. When Syriza promised to reject the austerity measures if

> never trusting governments and keeping political parties at a safe
> distance. All those people got their hopes up, and hope is one of the
> most valuable things in a revolutionary movement. The option to reject
> the austerity measures won the referendum and, predictably, Syriza did
> not keep their promise. Once you’re a political party in power, making
> enemies with banks and other states just doesn’t make sense. Their
> hopes dashed, the social movements deflated, the rightwing came into
> power, and austerity became the order of the day in Greece.[^14]
