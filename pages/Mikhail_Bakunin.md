**Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin** (30 May 1814 – 1 July 1876) was one of
the most influential figures in the history and development of
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>,
often referred to as the 'father of anarchism'. He linked the anarchist
movement to

complicated by his expressions of racism and antisemitism, which
anarchists have struggled with ever since.

## Biography

### Family

According to legend, the Bakunin dynasty was founded in 1492 by one of
three brothers of the noble Báthory family who left Hungary to serve
under Vasili III of Russia. The first documented ancestor was a Moscow
dyak (clerk) Nikifor Evdokimov, nicknamed Bakunya (from the Russian
*bakunya*, *bakulya* meaning "chatterbox, phrase monger") who lived
during the 17th century.

Mikhail was the son of Alexander Mikhailovich Bakunin, a diplomat who
served in Italy and France before retiring to a feudal estate of 500
serfs (where Mikhail was born). His grandmother, knyazna Lubov Petrovna
Myshetskaya, belonged to the impoverished Upper Oka Principalities
branch of the Rurik dynasty founded by Mikhail Yurievich Tarussky,
grandson of Michael of Chernigov.

In 1810, Alexander Bakunin married Varvara Alexandrovna Muravyova
(1792-1864), who was 24 years younger. She came from the ancient noble
Muravyov family founded during the 15th century by the Ryazan boyar Ivan
Vasilievich Alapovsky, nicknamed Muravey (meaning "ant"), who was
granted lands in Veliky Novgorod. Among her second cousins were Nikita
Muravyov and Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, key figures of the Decembrist
revolt.

Alexander's commitment to liberal ideas led to his involvement with one
of the Decembrist clubs. After Nicolas I became Emperor, he abandoned
politics and devoted himself to the estate and his children—five girls
and five boys, the oldest of whom was Mikhail.

### Youth

At 14, Bakunin left for Saint Petersburg and trained as an artillery
officer, going to serve in Minsk in 1833. He did not enjoy army life
and, having considerable free time, devoted himself to self-education.
He left the army in 1835, hoping to study philosophy in Moscow.

In Moscow, he met and befriended several former university students,
notably Nikolay Stankevich, Konstantin Aksakov, Piotr Chaadaev,
Alexander Herzen, and Nikolay Ogarev. They studied the philosophies of
Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Goethe, Hoffman, and Hegel. Bakunin translated
many of these works into Russian and began advocating for a unified
Slavic nation.

He left for Berlin in 1840, desiring to become a university philosophy
professor. There he encountered many Young Hegelians and Berlin's
socialist movement. He moved to Dresden, befriended Arnold Ruge, and
became an avowed socialist, abandoning his professorial ambitions to
dedicate himself to promoting revolution.

This led to troubles with the Russian government, which ordered his
return. When he refused, they confiscated his property, leading him to
move to Switzerland in 1842. He stayed in Zürich, befriended Wilhelm
Weitling, and began calling himself a communist, authoring articles for
communist newspapers. He moved to Geneva shortly before Weitling's
arrest, leading to investigation by Swiss police.

Once again ordered to return to Russia, he instead left for Belgium,
meeting many German and Polish radicals in exile, notably Joachim
Lelewel, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels in Brussels. He came into
conflict with his nationalist friends as he began supporting liberty for
all people and the liberation of the peasantry.

In 1844, Bakunin went to Paris and established contact with Karl Marx
and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who greatly impressed him and with whom he
formed a personal bond. He was stripped of his nobility, his Russian
land was confiscated, and he was condemned to exile in Siberia—though he
refused to go and instead traveled through Europe, advocating a joint
revolution of Polish and Russian people against the Russian Empire.

### Revolution, Arrest and Exile

Bakunin participated enthusiastically in the 1848 Revolution in Europe,
obtaining funding from the Provisional Government for the liberation of
Slavs in the Prussian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires. He
traveled through Germany attempting to join the insurrection in Baden,
leading to conflict with Karl Marx. Refused entry to Poland, he traveled
to Leipzig, Breslau, and Prague, where he participated in the First Pan
Slav Congress, leading to his involvement in the May Conspiracy and the
May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. He helped organize the defense of the
barricades against Prussian troops alongside Richard Wagner and Wilhelm
Heine.

Bakunin was captured in Chemnitz and held for thirteen months before
being condemned to death by the government of Saxony. He was saved and
extradited to Austria, where he was again sentenced to death, but then
extradited to Russia and taken to the underground dungeons of the Peter
and Paul Fortress. He spent another four years in the castle of
Shlisselburg, where he suffered from scurvy and all his teeth fell out
due to the diet. He later recounted finding some relief in mentally
re-enacting the legend of Prometheus. His continuing imprisonment in
these conditions led him to consider suicide by consuming smuggled
poison.

Pleas from his noble family led to his release from prison, allowing him
to go into exile in Tomsk, Siberia. He married Antonina Kwiatkowska, the
daughter of a Polish merchant whom he had been teaching French. He
obtained a job with the Amur Development Agency through his second
cousin, the liberal governor in Eastern Siberia. Mikhail proposed the
construction of a United States of Siberia, modeled on the
<a href="United_States_of_America" class="wikilink"
title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. He quit
his job and received a pension from the state. His second cousin was
forced to resign over fears of a Siberian revolution and was replaced by
the new and more liberal governor Korsakov, who gave Bakunin free
passage on all ships in the Amur river provided he returned to Irkutsk
in winter.

### Escape from Exile

On 5 June 1861, Mikhail began his escape from Russia by claiming he was
on a business trip to Nikolaevsk. He took the Russian warship *Strelok*
to the port city of Olga, where he boarded an American ship to Japan. By
chance, he befriended a group of Europeans in Japan and took a ship to
San Francisco, then to Panama, and then to New York, where he went to
Boston and found a group of exiled European revolutionaries. He then
left for Europe, moving to England.

He attempted to join the Polish Insurrection in 1863 but became stuck in
Copenhagen. With the insurrection's failure, he met his wife in
Stockholm and moved through London, Brussels, Paris, and Switzerland to
Italy to create a new revolutionary force in the new country—the
Alliance of Revolutionary Socialists.

By 1866, his secret society had grown to have members in most of
Europe's countries and began to oppose the very existence of the
<a href="State_(Polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>. He
met Giuseppe Fanelli and later sponsored him to travel to Barcelona to
share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the
International Workingmen's Association. He began advocating for the
anarchism of Proudhon and attended IWA conferences yearly.

During 1867–1868, Bakunin responded to Émile Acollas's call and became
involved in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), for which he wrote
the lengthy essay *Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism*. Here he
advocated federalist socialism, drawing on Proudhon's work. He supported
freedom of association and the right of secession for each unit of the
federation, but emphasized that this freedom must be joined with
socialism: "liberty without socialism is privilege, injustice; socialism
without liberty is slavery and brutality".[^1]

Bakunin played a prominent role in the Geneva Conference (September
1867) and joined the Central Committee. The founding conference was
attended by 6,000 people. At the Bern Congress of the League (1868),
Bakunin and other socialists (Élisée Reclus, Aristide Rey, Jaclard,
Giuseppe Fanelli, N. Joukovsky, V. Mratchkovsky) found themselves in a
minority. They seceded from the League, establishing their own
International Alliance of Socialist Democracy, which adopted a
revolutionary socialist program.

### First International and the Rise of the Anarchist Movement

In 1868, Bakunin joined the Geneva section of the First International,
remaining very active until his expulsion by Karl Marx and his followers
at the Hague Congress in 1872. Bakunin was instrumental in establishing
branches of the International in Italy and Spain.

In 1869, the Social Democratic Alliance was refused entry to the First
International on the grounds that it was an international organization
in itself, and only national organizations were permitted membership.
The Alliance dissolved and the various groups comprising it joined the
International separately.

Between 1869 and 1870, Bakunin became involved with the Russian
revolutionary Sergey Nechayev in clandestine projects. However, Bakunin
publicly broke with Nechaev over what he described as the latter's
"Jesuit" methods, by which all means were justified to achieve
revolutionary ends, though he privately attempted to maintain contact.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in Lyon based on principles later
exemplified by the Paris Commune, calling for a general uprising in
response to the collapse of the French government during the
Franco-Prussian War, seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into
social revolution. In his *Letters to A Frenchman on the Present
Crisis*, he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working
class and peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected
officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces,
and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action.

These ideas corresponded strikingly with the program of the Paris
Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (the Marxist and Blanquist factions had voted for
confrontation with the army while the Proudhonists supported a truce).
Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally
suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a
"rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting
not only the State but also revolutionary dictatorship. In a series of
powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International
against the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, winning over many
Italian republicans to the International and revolutionary socialism.

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the Marx party's attempt
to expel him at the Hague Congress, illustrated the growing divergence
between the "anti-authoritarian" sections of the International—which
advocated direct revolutionary action and organization of workers and
peasants to abolish the state and capitalism—and the sections allied
with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the
working class. Bakunin was "Marx's flamboyant chief opponent" and
"presciently warned against the emergence of a communist
authoritarianism that would take power over working people".

### Personal Life

In 1874, Bakunin retired with his young wife Antonia Kwiatkowska and
three children to Minusio (near Locarno in Switzerland), in a villa
called *La Baronata* that the leader of the Italian anarchists Carlo
Cafiero had bought for him by selling his own estates in his native town
Barletta (Apulia). His daughter Maria Bakunin (1873-1960) became a
chemist and biologist. His daughter Sofia was the mother of Italian
mathematician Renato Caccioppoli.

Bakunin died in Bern on 1 July 1876. His grave can be found in
Bremgarten Cemetery of Bern, box 9201, grave 68. His original epitaph
reads: "Remember those who sacrificed everything for the freedom of
their country". In 2015, the commemorative plate was replaced with a
bronze portrait of Bakunin by Swiss artist Daniel Garbade containing
Bakunin's quote: "By striving to do the impossible, man has always
achieved what is possible". It was sponsored by the Dadaists of Cabaret
Voltaire Zurich, who adopted Bakunin posthumously.

### Freemasonry

Bakunin joined the Scottish Lodge of the Grand Orient de France in 1845.
However, his involvement with freemasonry lapsed until he was in
Florence in summer 1864. Garibaldi had attended the first real Italian
Masonic Constituent Assembly in Florence in May of that year and been
elected Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy. Here the local head
of the Mazzinist party was also grand master of the local lodge.

Although he soon dismissed freemasonry, it was in this period that he
abandoned his previous belief in a god and embraced atheism. He
formulated the phrase "God exists, therefore man is a slave. Man is
free, therefore there is no God. Escape this dilemma who can!" which
appeared in his unpublished *Catechism of a Freemason*. Indeed, it was
during this period that he established the International Revolutionary
Association with Italian revolutionaries who had broken with Mazzini
because they rejected his Deism as well as his purely 'political'
conception of revolution, which they saw as bourgeois with no element of
social revolution.

## Ideas and Contributions

### Core Anarchist Philosophy

Bakunin's anarchism centered on the abolition of all forms of authority
and hierarchy. He argued that the state, church, and capitalism were
interconnected systems of domination that must be destroyed
simultaneously. Unlike Marx, who advocated for a transitional
"dictatorship of the proletariat," Bakunin insisted that any
transitional state would simply become a new form of tyranny.

His famous prediction about Marxist states—that they would become
dictatorships ruled by a new class of bureaucrats claiming to act in the
name of the workers—proved tragically accurate with the rise of the
Soviet Union and other authoritarian communist regimes. This prescience
has vindicated anarchist critiques of state socialism.

### Federalism and Free Association

Bakunin advocated for a federalist organization of society based on free
association. He envisioned a world organized from the bottom up, where
workers and peasants would form voluntary associations and communes that
would freely federate with each other. This stood in sharp contrast to
centralized state planning.

He believed that revolution must be made by the masses themselves, not
by a vanguard party acting on their behalf. The revolutionary
organization should inspire and coordinate, but never command or take
power for itself.

### Critique of Marxism

Bakunin's conflict with Marx went beyond personal animosity to
fundamental theoretical disagreements. He argued that Marx's focus on
industrial workers in advanced countries ignored the revolutionary
potential of peasants and the dispossessed. He warned that Marx's
insistence on centralized party organization and state control would
lead to a new ruling class—the "Red bureaucracy"—exploiting workers in
the name of socialism.

His critique of the authoritarian tendencies within Marxism anticipated
the totalitarian nature of 20th-century communist states. As Noam
Chomsky noted, Bakunin's prediction that Marxist regimes would become
dictatorships was "one of the few predictions in the social sciences
that actually came true".

### Internationalism

Bakunin was a committed internationalist who rejected nationalism as a
tool of state power. While he initially supported Slavic liberation
movements, he came to see that national liberation alone, without social
revolution, would simply replace one ruling class with another. He
advocated for the international solidarity of workers and oppressed
peoples against all states and ruling classes.

## The Problem of Bakunin's Prejudices

### Antisemitism and Racism

Bakunin's legacy is severely compromised by his expressions of
antisemitism and racism, particularly in his polemics against Marx and
in his writings on Slavic peoples. His antisemitic statements were not
mere products of his era—they were actively harmful and contradicted his
professed egalitarian principles.

Bakunin deployed antisemitic tropes about Jewish financial control and
characterized Marx's ideas as expressions of "Jewish" authoritarianism.
He wrote disparagingly about Germans and Jews in ways that invoked
racial stereotypes.

While some defenders note that such prejudices were common among
19th-century European radicals (Marx himself made antisemitic statements
despite his Jewish heritage), and that Bakunin's antisemitism was not
central to his anarchist theory, this provides no excuse. The
contradiction between Bakunin's stated commitment to universal human
freedom and his ethnic prejudices reveals a profound failure to live up
to his own principles.

### The Anarchist Response

Contemporary anarchists have grappled with this legacy in various ways.
Some, like biographer Mark Leier and scholar Eirik Eiglad, argue that
while Bakunin's antisemitism was real and wrong, his anarchist ideas can
be separated from these prejudices—that people come to anarchism for its
vision of freedom and equality, not for Bakunin's ethnic hatreds.

Others contend that we must confront this contradiction directly: a
movement dedicated to universal human liberation cannot make excuses for
racism and antisemitism, even from its foundational figures. The
anarchist principle of opposing all hierarchy and domination must extend
to challenging racism, antisemitism, and all forms of bigotry, including
when they appear in our own history.

This tension remains relevant because it reminds anarchists that
revolutionary theory means nothing without revolutionary practice in all
aspects of life. Bakunin's failure to extend his critique of hierarchy
to his own ethnic prejudices demonstrates that liberation must be
intersectional—that we cannot fight only the forms of oppression we
personally experience while perpetuating others.

## Influence and Legacy

Despite these serious flaws, Bakunin's anarchist ideas profoundly
influenced revolutionary movements worldwide. His emphasis on direct
action, workers' self-management, and opposition to state socialism
inspired the anarchist movements in Spain, Italy, and Russia. The
Spanish anarchists who fought fascism in the 1930s drew heavily on
Bakuninist ideas of workers' councils and collectivization.

His writings influenced major anarchist thinkers including Peter
Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Emma Goldman, and Rudolf Rocker. His
critique of authoritarianism resonated with the New Left of the 1960s
and continues to influence contemporary anti-authoritarian movements.

Bakunin's prediction that Marxist-Leninist states would become
dictatorships has been vindicated by history. His insistence that means
and ends must be consistent—that you cannot create freedom through
authoritarian methods—remains a vital anarchist principle.

However, his legacy must be approached critically. Anarchism has evolved
beyond Bakunin, incorporating feminist critiques, anti-racist analysis,
and ecological consciousness that were absent or contradicted in his
work. Modern anarchism builds on his anti-authoritarian insights while
rejecting his prejudices and expanding the struggle for liberation to
all forms of hierarchy and oppression.

## Selected Quotes

"Freedom, the realization of freedom: who can deny that this is what
today heads the agenda of history? We must not only act politically, but
in our politics act religiously, religiously in the sense of freedom, of
which the one true expression is justice and love."[^2]

"The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"[^3]

"We are convinced that liberty without socialism is privilege and
injustice; and that socialism without liberty is slavery and
brutality."[^4]

"Political Freedom without economic equality is a pretense, a fraud, a
lie; and the workers want no lying."[^5]

"I am a fanatic lover of liberty, considering it as the unique condition
under which intelligence, dignity and human happiness can develop and
grow; not the purely formal liberty conceded, measured out and regulated
by the State, an eternal lie which in reality represents nothing more
than the privilege of some founded on the slavery of the rest."[^6]

"To revolt is a natural tendency of life. Even a worm turns against the
foot that crushes it. In general, the vitality and relative dignity of
an animal can be measured by the intensity of its instinct to
revolt."[^7]

"If there is a State, there must be domination of one class by another
and, as a result, slavery; the State without slavery is unthinkable—and
this is why we are the enemies of the State."[^8]

"When the people are being beaten with a stick, they are not much
happier if it is called 'the People's Stick.'"[^9]

"By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is
possible. Those who have cautiously done no more than they believed
possible have never taken a single step forward."[^10]

"I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally
free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my
freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and
confirmation."[^11]
