# Historical Materialism

## Overview

**Historical materialism** is the **Marxist** theory that human
societies develop through inevitable stages driven by changes in their
**mode of production** - the way they organize labor and distribute
resources. **Karl Marx** and **Friedrich Engels** argued that the
economic base (relations of production) determines the political and
ideological superstructure (law, government, culture, ideas), and that
internal contradictions within each economic system inevitably drive
transition to the next stage.

While anarchists share Marx's emphasis on **material conditions** and
**class struggle**, they have developed substantial critiques of
historical materialism's core assumptions, particularly its **economic
determinism**, **stage theory**, and the priority it assigns to economic
over political domination.

## Core Tenets

Historical materialism proposes that all societies progress through a
series of stages:

- **Primitive communism** - Pre-class societies with common ownership
- **Slave society** - Production based on chattel slavery (ancient
  world)
- **Feudalism** - Production based on serfdom and land tenure
- **Capitalism** - Production based on wage labor and private ownership
  of means of production
- **Socialism** - Transitional stage with workers' control of state
- **Communism** - Classless, stateless society

Marx argued these transitions occur when the **forces of production**
(technology, knowledge, skills) come into conflict with existing
**relations of production** (property systems, class structures). Each
system contains the seeds of its own destruction through internal
contradictions - most importantly, capitalism creates the working class
that will eventually overthrow it.

Crucially, Marx insisted these stages could not be skipped. Societies
must develop capitalism and a mature working class before socialist
revolution becomes possible.

## Historical Materialism and Stagism

Marx's theory of inevitable historical stages depends partly on the
assumption that **commodity exchange emerges naturally** from human
economic activity. Marx largely accepted the conventional economic
narrative that money arose from barter trade - that primitive peoples
naturally began exchanging goods, encountered the "double coincidence of
wants" problem, and invented money to facilitate trade.[^1]

If money arose naturally from barter, then markets and eventually
capitalism represent a kind of natural evolution that societies must
pass through. However, **David Graeber** comprehensively demonstrated in
*Debt: The First 5000 Years* that the barter origin story has no basis
in historical or anthropological evidence. Anthropologist **Caroline
Humphrey** concluded that "no example of a barter economy, pure and
simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of
money."[^2]

Instead, money emerged from:

- **State temple bureaucracies** managing thousands of workers in
  ancient Mesopotamia
- **Legal systems** for regulating violence and compensation (wergeld,
  blood money)
- **Military provisioning** - coinage to pay soldiers in standing armies
- **Debt and violence** - using monetary debt to dislodge people from
  traditional social relations

If Graeber is correct that money was **imposed through state
bureaucracies, military conquest, and violence** rather than emerging
naturally from exchange, then Marx's stages are not inevitable at all.
This supports **Mikhail Bakunin's** argument that societies could skip
stages and move directly to anarchism, which Marx furiously rejected.

Marx insisted peasant societies like Russia needed to develop capitalism
first before revolution was possible. Bakunin (correctly, as it turned
out) predicted revolution would come from "recently proletarianized
peasants and artisans" rather than advanced industrial workers.[^3] The
major communist revolutions of the twentieth century - Russia, China,
Cuba, Vietnam - all occurred in predominantly peasant societies, not in
the advanced industrial nations Marx predicted.

## The Priority of the State vs. Economics

If money and markets are **products of state power** rather than natural
human behaviors that states later regulated, this fundamentally
undermines Marx's **economic determinism** - the idea that the economic
base determines the political/legal superstructure.

Anarchists have always argued that **domination and hierarchy**
(primarily embodied in the state) are the fundamental problem, with
economic exploitation as one manifestation. **Pierre-Joseph Proudhon**,
**Mikhail Bakunin**, and **Peter Kropotkin** all insisted that political
power could not be reduced to economic relations, and that the state
itself was a primary source of oppression rather than merely
capitalism's enforcer.

The historical evidence supports this anarchist position. Money itself
emerges from:

- **State temple bureaucracies** - Mesopotamian temples created the
  first systems of money as accounting units to manage worker rations
  and production
- **Legal systems for regulating violence** - Medieval wergeld systems
  assigned monetary values to injuries and deaths to prevent blood feuds
- **Military provisioning** - Coinage was invented primarily to pay
  soldiers in standing armies

If these origins are correct, then **political power is more primary
than economic relations**, which is exactly what anarchists claim. The
state is not just capitalism's enforcer - it is the **creator of the
conditions for capitalism** to exist.

Graeber's research on English wage labor demonstrates this dramatically.
The transformation of medieval service relations into modern wage labor
required massive **state intervention**:

- **Enclosure movements** driving peasants from common lands
- **Vagrancy laws** criminalizing masterless people
- **Settlement Acts** forcing workers into yearly service contracts
- **Masters and Servants Laws** imposing fines and imprisonment for
  workers who quit
- **Legal redefinition** of creditor-debtor relations to subordinate
  workers to employers

The **open-ended duty of obedience** characteristic of modern employment
did not emerge naturally from market competition. It was **legally
imposed** through centuries of state violence and judicial
intervention.[^4]

## The Nature of Human Nature

The barter myth assumes humans are naturally **calculating,
self-interested exchangers** (homo economicus). Marx accepted this
anthropology to some degree, seeing it as the reality under capitalism
even if historically produced. This led him to believe:

- People need material incentives to work
- Some form of accounting and compensation is necessary (hence "labor
  vouchers" in early socialism)
- Immediate communism is impossible without a transitional period

But **Peter Kropotkin** drew on actual anthropology showing that
**mutual aid, gift-giving, and cooperation** are more fundamental human
behaviors than competition or calculated exchange.[^5] Anthropological
evidence demonstrates that:

- Non-monetary societies operate through systems of **informal credit
  and obligation**, not barter
- **Gift economies** create ongoing social bonds rather than ending
  obligations
- People give freely to neighbors, expecting reciprocity over time
  without calculation
- **Communal provisioning** existed in many societies without money or
  formal accounting

If anarchists are right about human nature, then:

- Marx's "scientific" gradualism is unnecessary
- Immediate anarchist communism becomes plausible
- Workers' instincts about freedom and equality are more trustworthy
  than vanguard intellectuals' "science"

## Vanguardism and Worker Consciousness

Marx's belief that workers need **scientific socialist leadership** to
understand history's inevitable direction depends on there being an
inevitable direction. If economic forms arise from **violence and
imposition** rather than natural development, then:

- There is no scientific "law" of history to understand
- Workers' own direct experiences of domination are better guides than
  theoretical analysis
- **Direct action** and immediate resistance (anarchist approach) make
  more sense than patient education about historical stages

This relates to why Marx was hostile to **Proudhon's** empirical
approach. Proudhon observed actual working-class practices - **mutual
credit**, **cooperatives**, **workers' associations** - and attempted to
systematize them. Marx dismissed this as utopian tinkering. But if money
is not a natural evolution and capitalism required state violence to
create, then **workers' own experiments** might be more valuable than
Marx's "scientific" analysis.

**Bakunin** argued that workers already understood their oppression
through lived experience and did not need an intellectual vanguard to
explain it to them. The role of revolutionaries was to support workers'
own organizations and initiatives, not to lead them according to a
predetermined historical script.

## Dialectics and Contradiction

Marx's **dialectical method** assumes systems develop internal
contradictions that transform them into their opposites - that
capitalism contains the seeds of communism within itself. But if
capitalism required **massive state violence** to create through
enclosures, vagrancy laws, colonial conquest, and chattel slavery, then:

- It is not an inevitable stage but an **imposed system**
- Its contradictions will not naturally resolve themselves
- **Smashing the state** (anarchist approach) rather than capturing it
  (Marxist approach) becomes more logical

Graeber's research shows how English wage labor required **deliberate
legal transformation** of master-servant relations. Medieval servants
had mutual obligations with masters - if the master had no work, he
still had to feed and house the servant. The transition to modern
employment systematically eliminated the master's obligations while
reinforcing the worker's **open-ended duty of obedience**. This was not
dialectical evolution but **juridical imposition**.[^6]

Anarchists argue that if the state created the conditions for capitalism
through violence, then the state remains the **primary enemy**.
Capturing state power to transition to communism (Marx's strategy) means
using the very instrument that created capitalism to supposedly abolish
it. This is why **Bakunin** insisted the state must be **immediately
destroyed** during revolution, not temporarily maintained as a
"dictatorship of the proletariat."

## Revolution: Capture or Abolish the State?

The debate over historical materialism connects directly to the central
**Marx-Bakunin split** in the First International. If state power
**created** markets and money through bureaucracy and violence, then:

- **Marx's position** - Capturing state power to manage the transition
  to communism - makes little sense, as it preserves the instrument that
  created capitalism
- **Bakunin's position** - The state must be immediately destroyed
  because it is the **source** of economic exploitation, not just its
  protector

Marx argued Bakunin was naive about power, that society needs a
transitional "dictatorship of the proletariat" to suppress
counter-revolution and organize production. But historical experience
has largely vindicated anarchist concerns:

- Communist revolutions occurred in **peasant societies** (Russia,
  China, Cuba) not advanced industrial ones, as Bakunin predicted and
  Marx denied
- **Socialist states never withered away** but became new forms of
  domination, often more totalitarian than the capitalist states they
  replaced
- The most successful worker movements were often **syndicalist and
  anarchist** ones emphasizing direct action (Spanish CNT-FAI, early
  IWW, Revolutionary Ukraine)
- State socialist economies replicated many capitalist problems,
  including meaningless work and worker alienation

## Anarchist Alternatives to Historical Materialism

Anarchists do not reject **materialism** or the importance of **economic
conditions**. Rather, they reject the specific claims that:

- Economic relations determine political structures (rather than
  co-constituting each other)
- History progresses through inevitable stages
- Societies must develop capitalism before communism is possible
- A transitional state is necessary

### Bakunin's Approach

**Mikhail Bakunin** emphasized that **political domination and economic
exploitation** are intertwined but neither fully determines the other.
The state and capitalism emerged together and must be destroyed
together. He argued for:

- **Immediate revolutionary transformation** rather than gradual
  development
- **Workers' associations** and **federations** organizing production
  without states or capitalists
- Trust in workers' own **spontaneous revolutionary instincts** rather
  than vanguard leadership

### Kropotkin's Mutual Aid

**Peter Kropotkin** provided an alternative historical account
emphasizing **cooperation over competition**. Drawing on biology,
anthropology, and history, he demonstrated that:

- **Mutual aid** is as important as competition in evolution
- Societies that cooperate most effectively tend to flourish
- Humans have powerful instincts toward cooperation and solidarity
- These instincts are suppressed by capitalism and the state but remain
  latent

This suggests that communist social relations need not develop from
capitalism but can emerge from humans' own cooperative nature once
domination is removed.[^7]

### Proudhon's Empiricism

**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon** rejected grand historical theories in favor
of **observing actual working-class practices**:

- Workers already create **mutual aid societies**
- They establish **cooperatives** and **workers' associations**
- They develop **mutual credit systems** informally
- Revolution means expanding and systematizing what workers already do

From this perspective, revolutionary change comes not from understanding
history's inevitable direction but from **supporting workers' own
initiatives**.
