Çatalhöyük was a proto-city in Anatolia founded around 7500 BCE with a
population of as many as 8,000 people living on 34 acres.[^1] Ian
Hodder, a Stanford archeologist who has led the excavation of the site
since the 1990s, explains:

> “People lived with the principle of equality in Çatalhöyük, especially
> considering the hierarchy that appeared in other settlements in the
> Middle East. This makes Çatalhöyük different. There was no leader,
> government or administrative building; men and women were equal.[^2]

Çatalhöyük was part of a broader "Sesklo culture" which, according to
Marija Gimbutas, had an "absence of outstanding central buildings which
could suggest a hierarchy."[^3] Citing the archeologist James Mellaart's
work in the 1950s and 1960s Murray Bookchin writes:

As Catalhoyuk became less egalitarian, people abandoned the site.
Archeologist Henry Wright summarizes:

# Culture

With no elite class or gender hierarchy, the whole population
experienced lives full of feasts, music, dance, and mural painting.
Houses stood wall to wall with no space between them, forming what
Mellaart called a "honeycomb structure." People moved between houses by
walking across the rooftops.[^6]

People lived in nearly identical houses and were buried with roughly the
same quality and quantity of goods. Hodder argues these similarities
suggest <a href="compulsory_conformity" class="wikilink"
title="compulsory conformity">compulsory conformity</a>:

However, the wide diversity of burial goods suggests to Bernhard Brosius
that Çatalhöyük's society respected people's individuality:

> The burial objects found in the graves emphasize not only social

> differences between individuals than differences due to membership of
> different classes (Childe 1952: 143-144) [^8]

## Egalitarianism

Women and men were equal. As Hodder explains, "Thanks to modern
scientific techniques, we have seen that women and men were eating very
similar foods, lived similar lives and worked in similar works. The same
social stature was given to both men and women. We have learned that men
and women were equally approached".[^9]

Older houses had a somewhat greater density of prestigous objects such
as hunting trophies and a volcanic glass called obsidian. This suggests
to Graeber and Wengrow that "elders, and perhaps elder women in
particular, held positions of influence. But the more prestigious
households are distributed among the less and do not coalesce into elite
neighborhoods."[^10]

## Religion

The religion appears to have been non-hierarchical and based on a
Goddesses-centered cosmology. Of 41 excavated sculptures of deities, 33
were of a goddess and only 8 depicted of a masculine god. Although there
were priestesses, there was "no evidence of a hierarchical
organization."[^11] Temples are distributed among regular houses,
suggesting of religion with everyday life.[^12]

Çatalhöyük's Goddess was apparently in a symbol of life as well of
death. Symbolizing her powers of life, she was often depicted with wild
animals, plants, and piles of grain. Symbolizing her powers of death,
she was often accompanied by a bird of prey, perhaps a vulture. The care
of corpses suggested that the people of Çatalhöyük believed in an
afterlife. Artwork portraying life was often on the west side of
buildings and associated with the color red, while scenes portraying
death were on the east and contained black.[^13]

David Lewis-Williams and David Pierce speculate that the people of
Çatalhöyük believed in a tiered cosmos and modeled their city after it.
The houses' ladders and pillars represented contact between worlds. Bull
heads were often plastered on pillars, signifying the bull's role in the
interaction between the everyday and spirit worlds. Lewis-Williams and
Pierce also suggest that the ubiquitous handprints signified contact
with the spirit world and that the burials of bodies beneath the
residential floors allowed the dead into an underworld.[^14]

## Recreation

Feasts and festivals appear to have been frequent. Almost half of the
adult skeletons showed signs of alteration that may have resulted from
frequent dancing.[^15]

## Matrilinearity

Children were buried by women, not by men, and the women's burial
platform was larger and more elevated. Heide Goettner-Abendroth writes,
"Here again we can deduce that the house belonged to the woman and was
seen as the mother- house; the children were clearly affiliated with the
mother—-which indicates matrilineality."[^16]

Goettner-Abendroth also hypothesizes that Çatalhöyük residents believed
in rebirth through the mother's line:

> the skulls were always found beneath the sleeping platforms. This
> allowed the loved ones to speak as ancestral spirits to the living in

> Infants were buried in braided grass baskets near the sacred hearth,
> which was the woman’s place.146 The intention was probably to give
> children who had died young the greatest opportunity to be born
> again.[^17]

# Economy

Economic equality can be deduced from the facts that dwellings were all
roughly the same size, and burial goods were of roughly the same
quantity and quality.[^18] There is no evidence that Çatalhöyük had an
internal market economy.[^19]

Residents practiced flood-retreat farming which required minimal labor
or central management and no deforestation.[^20] Researchers estimate
that less than half of people's labor time focused on meeting people's
basic needs, and the other half focused on cultural production such as
organizing feasts, dances, rituals, education, and the painting of
murals.[^21]

At 29.8 years, women's life expectancy in Çatalhöyük was 1.6 years
longer than women's life expectancy had been in the European and
Mediterranean regions during the Upper Paleolithic period. Women's
slightly lower life expectancy than men's resulted from the rate of
death at childbirth.[^22] Çatalhöyük's lifespan surpassed the lifespan
of exploited populations for subsequent millennia until around 1750. A
small portion of the population lived to the ages of 60 to 70.[^23]

# Environment

Paintings of animals may have suggested a reverence for non-human life.
The combination of small farming, hunting, and gathering fed the society
that lasted about two millennia.[^24]

According to Lewis-Williams and Pierce, Catalhoyuk had a
“backwards-and-forwards (dialectic) process between the ‘wild’ and
humanity.” As examples, they point to images show women giving birth to
wild bulls and associate women and leopards.[^25]

## Cattle domestication

Çatalhöyük resisted domesticating cattle until around around 6000 BCE,
even though the Fertile crescent had domesticated them around 8000 BCE
and societies in Çatalhöyük's region kept cattle by 6500 BCE.[^26] It
therefore seems Çatalhöyük's rejection of cattle domestication was a
conscious choice. Although David Graeber and David Wengrow posit that
they rejected cattle domestication in order to preserve men's prestige
for hunting wild cattle,[^27] another reason might be that they wished
to preserve gender egalitarianism, since cattle rearing and cattle-based
ploughing has been linked with patriarchal attitudes.[^28]

Indeed, the eventual transition from hunting to cattle herding appears
to have coincided with a decline in egalitarianism and with
environmental problems caused by deforestation and overgrazing. In
*Discover Magazine*, Jennifer Hattam writes, "Ongoing research may link
the arrival of domesticated cattle with emerging inequality between
households, and increasingly individualistic behavior among Çatalhöyük
residents."[^29]

# Crime

Çatalhöyük residents were generally peaceful with each other, but they
had mechanisms for responding when crowded conditions encouraged
antisocial behavior. There were no signs of violent death among the many
hundreds of skeletons excavated by James Mellaart.[^30] But more
recently, excavation of skulls with nonfatal cranial fractures led some
archeologists in 2019 to conclude that "intragroup violence was present
among the inhabitants of the site, sporadically but continually."[^31]

Although there are many of images of hunting, Çatalhöyük's paintings do
not contain images of crime against humans. While people were buried
with goods, there is no evidence of grave robbery. Brosius speculates:

> Taken as a whole, these facts today seem as the archaeology of an
> utopia. However, we must understand that 10,000 people without central
> power could never have lived together in such density for such a long
> time if they had not possessed nonviolent methods for solving
> conflicts in the first place. If use of force had been part of the
> repertoire of strategies for conflict resolution, settlements such as
> Çatalhöyük would not have been able to survive for such a long time -
> no one could have prevented the settlement from dissolving. Another
> argument in favour of the absence of violence a priori is the above
> mentioned complete absence of destruction in the cultic area: people
> had developed images of the beyond which were just as peaceful as they
> themselves were.[^32]

# Neighboring Societies

Bernhard Brosius argues that Çatalhöyük existed in a context of
widespread non-patriarchal "neolithic communism" lasting for three
thousand years and spreading to all of Anatolia. There is evidence of a
social revolution in the city of
<a href="Cayonu" class="wikilink" title="Cayonu">Cayonu</a> in the year
7200 BCE that overthrew a violent class society and installed an
apparently egalitarian society more similar to Çatalhöyük.

However, Çatalhöyük's buildings and artifacts remained exceptionally
well-preserved compared to the neighboring cities and towns.[^33]
