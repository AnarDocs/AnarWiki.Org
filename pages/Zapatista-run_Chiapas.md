## Overview

In Mexico's southern-most state of Chiapas, indigenous Maya small
farmers rose up in 1994 and established an autonomous zone encompassing,
by 2018, about 300,000 residents.[^1] Without accepting any funds from
the Mexican government since 1996[^2], Zapatista-run communities have
built their own health clinics, schools, credit unions, community
centers, and hospitals. Starting in 2003, the Zapatistas governed their
own affairs with a direct democratic governance system, centered in each
zone’s administrative center called a *carcacol*, meaning “snail.” Their
struggle has profoundly influenced social movements around the world.

In 2017, even the *New York Times* acknowledged the movement's successes
at creating a functioning alternative society:

> "In the following years, the Zapatista-controlled territories
> exercised de facto autonomy, delivering broad access to education and
> health services. Organized crime has been unable to penetrate the
> area."[^3]

On 7 August 2019, the Zapatistas announced they were expanding their
territory with seven new caracoles and four new Autonomous
Municipalities. This brought the total number of caracoles to twelve and
the total number of Autonomous Municipalities to thirty-one.[^4]

In 2023, the Zapatistas announced they were suspending their
direct-democratic Good Government Councils and replacing them with a
more decentralized structure.[^5]

## Culture

The Zapatistas have sought to carry out “cultural resistance” to combat
consumerist and oppressive elements of mainstream society while both
preserving and revolutionizing the traditions of the Tojolabal, Tzotzil,
Tzeltal, Chol, Zoque and Castilian peoples in the Zapatista territories.
This has involved the preservation of local music, holidays and
languages.[^6]

As a result of the Zapatistas's 1994 Revolutionary Law of Women, women
have a right to work at any job they choose, to reproductive freedom,
and formal gender equality.[^7] Comandante Ramona, who drafted the
Revolutionary Law of Women, travelled to communities and recruited women
to the Zapatista struggle by promising to struggle against patriarchal
oppression. Ramona recounts, "The women finally understood that their
participation is important if this bad situation is to change. There is
no other way of seeking justice, and this is the interest of the
women."[^8]

> “Before, the women lived below the control of their fathers, and since
> we respected our fathers, they said if their daughters could work a
> job or not,” reports the Zapatista woman Eloísa. She notes,
> “Afterwards, when we arrived as our organization \[in 1994\] we began
> to see the distinct areas of work that we have as an organization of
> the \[Zapatista National Liberation Army, or EZLN,\] and we began to
> carry out different jobs as women.”[^9] Women make up about a quarter
> of the EZLN.[^10] The Good Government Board in the Zapatistas' region
> of La Realidad has seen an increase in women membership. The first
> term had only one woman out of the 24 members. The second term had 5
> women, and the third term had 12 women, or 50 percent.[^11]

One measure secured by the insistence of Zapatista women was a ban on
alcohol, to combat domestic violence. It was implemented throughout the
territories around the start of the 1994 uprising.[^12]

Sexist tendencies still persist in Zapatista communities, as the
anthropologist Neils Barmeyer has observed: “In any indigenous village
of Chiapas, women can be seen working from well before dawn until after
sunset. This often involves heavy labor such as carrying large bundles
of wood, scrubbing laundry, separating corn from the cob, or milling
pozól. In contrast, the men usually take the afternoon off after
returning from the \[corn fields\]. After their siesta they can be seen
standing around in groups, talking and smoking along the road.[^13]
However, reports indicate that the situation has been dramatically
improving. In *ROAR Magazine*, Leonidas Oikonomakis writes:

> A Basque friend I met in Chiapas a couple of years ago told me that
> what had impressed him the most during his last visit to the Zapatista
> communities was the position of women. The Basque comrade had come to
> Chiapas for the first time in 1996, two years after the uprising, and
> he could still vividly remember that women used to walk 100 meters
> behind their husbands, and whenever the husband would stop, they would
> stop as well to maintain their distance. Women would be exchanged for
> a cow or a corn field when they were married off—not always to the man
> of their choice. The situation has been very neatly depicted in the
> Zapatista movie *Corazon del Tiempo*.
>
> Almost 20 years later, my Basque friend returned to Chiapas for the

> education (teachers, that is), nurses and doctors; and they serve as
> members of the Good Government Councils, or Juntas de Buen Gobierno,
> and as guerrilleras.[^14]

The Zapatistas have declared an opposition to heterosexism and all other
forms of oppression. Their Sixth Declaration from the Lancondon Jungle
expresses solidarity with “women, young people, the indigenous,
homosexuals, lesbians, transsexual persons, migrants and many other
groups who exist all over the world but who we do not see until they
shout \[enough already\] of being despised”.[^15]

</figure>

From 2003 to 2023, the Zapatistas' autonomous governance had three
levels: the community, the autonomous municipality, and the region. By
2012, over a thousand communities confederated into 29 Autonomous
Municipalities, which confederate into five regions.[^16] In 2019, the
Zapatistas announced an expansion bringing the number of Autonomous
Municipalities to 31 and the number of regions to twelve.[^17]

In November 2023, the Zapatistas announced a new structure with three
levels. First, there are thousands of Local Autonomous Government.
Second, there are hundreds of Collectives of Zapatista Autonomous
Government which coordinates among the local governments on matters such
as "Health, Education, Agroecology, Justice, Commerce." Third, there are
Assemblies of Collectives of Zapatista Autonomous Governments which
"convenes and presides over zone assemblies, when necessary according to
the requests of" the two more local levels. "They are based in the
caracoles, but move between regions. In other words, they are mobile,
according to the towns demands for attention."[^18]

The rest of this section is based on the older structure prior to
November 2023.

## Communities

At the community level, people gather at general assemblies to make
decisions, elect community administrators, and elect delegates to higher
levels of government. Elections are made with a simple majority vote,
and anyone over 12 can vote. However, votes are rare, since assemblies
strive for consensus.[^19] Each community has 3 main administrative
structures: (1) the *commissariat*, in charge of day-to day
administration; (2) the *council for land control*, which deals with
forestry and disputes with neighboring communities; and (3) the
*agencia*, an elected, volunteer patrol. These three committees, along
with others, form each community's Council of Authorities.

Barmeyer observed that each community elects three main officials: (1)
the *comisariado*, a delegate to the commissariat; (2) the *consejo*, a
delegate to the council for land control; and (3) the *agente*, a
delegate to the police. A fourth official, the *responsible de la
organizaction*, is a representative of the Zapatista National Liberation
Army. Barmeyer reports, "At the time of my research, el responsable was
not democratically elected but but the guerilla movement's command
rather presented a community member it deemed suitable, who was then
endorsed by the assembly...this practice may or may not have changed
with the introduction of" the Good Government Boards in 2003.

In the community of San Emilano, Barmeyer observed the weekly, communal
assembly break into ten *asembleas chicas*. Each group was made of
people of the same age. Each asemblea chica would make a decision and
nominate a spokesperson called a *portavoz* to meet in a council of
spokes. The council--anarchists would call it a *spoke-council*--tried
to reach consensus. Barmeyer notes: "That this practice is not
necessarily democratic is exemplified by the case in San Emiliano, where
six men's groups faced only four larger ones made of women. In case of
disagreement along the gender divide, the men clearly had a structural
upper hand in the decision-making process."[^20] Decisions at community
assemblies include topics such as whether to by a tractor or a
truck,[^21] whether to establish a vegetable farm, and how to respond to
a land conflict with a nearby army camp.[^22]

## Autonomous Municipalities

The communities confederate into 29 autonomous municipalities. Staffed
by biannually elected, instantly recallable and unpaid delegates from
the base communities, the municiaplity-level government has a structure
very similar to the community-level government. There is (1) the
*comisariado*, similar to the community's commissariat; (2) the *consejo
de vigilancia*, similar to the community's consejo; and (3) the *agencia
municipal*, similar to the community's agencia. As the community has a
representative of the military, the municipality has one called the
*regional*.

Barmeyer ovserved several municipal assemblies in 20 de Febrero in 2001.
There were 30 to 40 delegatres from 20 communities, representing about
300 families. Each community was represented by its *consejo* and its
*responsible*. Decisions included whether to contribute to a new
production project, and whether to send new guards to a grocery store
that had been raided.[^23]

## Regions

In 2003, the Zapatistas established their regional level of government,
called the Good Government Boards. The name played off the term "bad
government," the communities' slang term for the Mexican state
government. The members of Good Government Boards serve only 15 days of
each month and for only three years. At first the Good Government Board
members received a salary, but the Zapatistas quickly abolished monetary
compensation to these delegates. Instead, Good Government Board members
receive food or some other non-monetary assistance from their
communities, such as help with their farmland while they are serving in
government. “\[W\]e realized that the conscience and the desire to serve
our community is what is greatest,” explains the Zapatista Lorena.[^24]
The Good Government Boards help redistribute resources and coordinate
regulations between different municipalities. The delegates at the
municipal and regional levels in the region of La Realidad work together
to coordinate three communal stores and use the profits to fund
region-wide mobilizations.

## Economy

The Zapatistas have built a largely self-reliant economy that, without
fully separating itself from the global capitalist system, has provided
space for local self-management and community control. Aspects of their
economy may be described as somewhere between mutualism and
collectivism, with a coordinated network of participatory communities,
communal stores, worker collectives and family farmers. Their autonomous
government provides low-interest loans, free education and low-cost
health care. Without any assistance from the Mexican government, the
Zapatistas have built two hospitals, 18 health clinics, and 800
community health houses since 1994. They run 300 schools, with 1,000
teachers, and a center for secondary education. [^25]

Hilary Klein describes the Zapatistas' 'solidarity economy' as an
alternative to capitalist economics:

> In addition to health care and education, the Zapatistas have also
> constructed an economic infrastructure designed to address the high
> level of poverty in their communities. Often called a 'solidarity
> economy', the Zapatistas' autonomous economy offers a grassroots
> alternative to global capitalism \[...\] Economic cooperatives
> generate resources that are invested back into the community. Because
> of the gendered division of labor, there are often men's and women's
> cooperatives. Men, for exxample, have coffee or cattle cooperatives,
> whereas women have artisan cooperatives, chicken-raising cooperatives,
> and collective vegetable gardens. Cooperative stores provide
> merchandise for community members at reasonable prices while also
> generating income. Money raised by the cooperatives is used to cover
> shared expenses, for example when the community's representatives
> travel to a regional meeting.[^26]

Zapatistas farm on communally-owned areas of land called “ejidos”. The
community collectively decides how to use the ejido, usually dividing it
up so there is a plot for each family. Gustavo Esteva, a former adviser
to the Zapatistas, explains, “One thing it’s important to mention is
there doesn’t exist private property in the Zapatista communities. In
each one of the communities, all of the land is property of the
community.” There is no hunger among the Zapatistas, since the
communities grow enough food for everyone, and surplus to sell to
outsiders. The Zapatistas sell \$44 million worth of goods to the world
market every year, Esteva reported in October of 2013.[^27]

Zapatistas in La Realidad make a living by growing corn, beans, coffee,
bananas, sugar, and raising cattle, chicken and pigs, and working at
clothing, food, convenience stores, schools and in health care. There
are also less common jobs such as veterinarians or blacksmiths. Many
work as part of a family unit, while others work in cooperatives
coordinated by the communities and by the municipalities.[^28] The Good
Government Boards coordinate cattle collectives, radio stations,
low-interest loans to help people’s health costs, and a fund called
BANAMAZ for women’s worker collectives.[^29]

Noting the Zapatista communites' impoverished conditions, Trotskyist
Louis Proyect unfavorably compares them to the Cuban revolutionaries,
and he asserts the Zapatistas would be better off if they had taken
state power and extracted their territory's natural resources to fund
social programs.[^30]

The anarchist Andrew Flood argues that the Zapatistas' economy cannot be
called anti-capitalist, since it has not abolished capitalist activity
in its territories:

> The revolutionary laws produced by the EZLN on January 1st 1994 \[30\]
> cannot be called anti-capitalist. They restrict but still very much
> allow for wage labour, rent and even multi national investment. For
> example the law states, "Foreign companies will pay their workers an
> hourly salary in national money equivalent to what would be payed in
> dollars outside the country." \[29\] while a big step forward for many
> Mexican workers hardly amounts to the abolition of capitalism.[^31]

Andrej Grubacic and Denis O'Hearn classify that the Zapatistas' economy
as a significant but incomplete exit from world capitalism:

> We describe the economic activities of the Zapatistas as
> *contradictory substantive practices*. They are not in direct
> antagonism to the capitalist law of value, but they are undoubtably
> transformative. They are capital and state resistant, as they prevent
> complete incorporation into world-capitalist institutions and
> processes. They are anti-capital in certain respects or at certain
> times, but sometimes supportive of capitalism, even
> simultaneously.[^32]

## Education

<figure>
<img src="La_Realidad_school.jpg" title="La_Realidad_school.jpg" />
<figcaption>La_Realidad_school.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>

The Zapatistas run 300 schools, with 1,000 teachers, and a center for
secondary education. [^33] On average, the Zapatistas have more schools
than the surrounding indigenous communities governed by the right-wing
PRI.[^34] In the Zapatista schools, children and their elders together
decide on a curriculum, and there are no grades. The schools operate
based on the principle, “Nobody educates anybody else, nobody is
educated alone”.[^35]

Subjects taught in the schools include "autonomy, history, agroecology
and veterinary medicine." Classes are taught in Spanish and in
Indigenous languages.[^36]

## Health Care

“The rebel Zapatista communities, although not all, are the only ones
that have free health services” in Chiapas's indigenous
communities.[^37] Residents of the Zapatistas' region of La Realidad
maintain that their hospital is better than the surrounding
non-Zapatista hospitals. Unlike the La Realidad hospital, surrounding
non-Zapatista hospitals lack an ultra-sound machine and have doctors
with racist attitudes toward indigenous people. Roel, a former member of
La Realidad's Good Government Board, notes, “The result is that people
go to the \[Mexican\] government's hospital and need to have an
ultrasound study, for example, or a laboratory analysis, and the doctors
send them to our hospital.”[^38]

Anya Rebrii writes:

> Most communities have a local volunteer—a health promoter—who receives
> training in both traditional and modern medicine in
> Zapatista-organized regional health centers. These volunteers provide
> basic services in a local casa de salud (house of health).
>
> More advanced treatment is available in clinics located in crossroads

> workshop, a dozen beds for admissions, and is equipped with
> ambulances. Health coordinating committees, just like the education
> ones, exist on each administrative level, which ensures participation
> of communities in administering the autonomous health system.[^39]

A 2007 study commissioned by the Health Systems Knowledge Network (at
the time, a part of the World Health Organization's Commission on the
Social Determinants of Health) praises the Zapatistas' health care
system. It notes improvements like a decline in maternal mortality at
two Zapatista clinics and concludes, “This is a model which has proved
able to have an impact on what one can call the primary level of health
care.”[^40] ![](IMG_0415.JPG "IMG_0415.JPG")

## Environment

The Zapatistas have struggled against the extraction of oil, uranium and
timber on their lands. The Zapatista's autonomous government has banned
pesticides and chemical fertilizers.[^41] In *Enemy of Nature*, the
eco-Marxist scholar Joel Kovel calls the Zapatista rebellion “the first
model of revolutionary ecosocialism on a bioregional scale.”[^42]

Many Zapatista communities sit on top of or near oil deposits, and the
Zapatistas have resisted the oil industry's extraction. On February 16,
1996, the Zapatistas and the Mexican government signed the San Andrés
Accords, which allow the Zapatistas to veto extraction projects, but the
Mexican government has often violated the treaty.[^43] From 1999 to
2000, the Zapatistas conducted a sixteen-month blockade that
successfully prevented the construction of a highway through Armador
Hernandez's Montes Azules bioreserve. The highway would have been used
for the extraction of timber, uranium and oil.[^44]

In 2006, the Zapatistas proposed declaring 103 hectares as the Zapatista
Community Ecological Reserve[^45], a “Zapatista community protected
natural area and ecological reserve.” The Huitepec-Alcanfores Nature
Reserve was established in 2006 by the Good Government Council (JBG,
Junta de Buen Gobierno) of Oventik.[^46]

Javier Sethness Castro, while defending the Zapatista rebellion and its
"ecological self-management," points out certain problems from an
ecological and animal liberationist perspective:

> A similar critical line of thinking could also bring to light the
> extensive deforestation which Zapatista communities have produced
> through their “autonomous” desire to raise cattle en masse in jungle
> environments, or it could criticize the Zapatistas’s drinking and
> selling of Coca-Cola and their generally non-vegetarian lifestyles—or
> at least the ambivalence Marcos expresses as regards the prospect of
> even discussing this latter point, for he declares vegetarian tactics
> of moral suasion to be an imposition to be disobeyed. As Mickey Z.
> Vegan could be expected to point out, the collective Zapatista
> butcher-shop from the Roberto Barrios region mentioned in volume III
> may not be the most liberating project to engage in, for either BAEZLN
> workers or the beasts themselves.[^47]

## Crime

Each community has an elected, volunteer patrol that's sometimes
referred to as a community police agency:

> "While Zapatistas still have police, it is quite distinct from how we
> are used to think of it. As Paulina Fernandez Christlieb documents,
> they are neither armed, uniformed, nor professional. Similar to other
> authorities, police are elected by their community; they are not
> remunerated and do not serve in this function permanently. Every
> community has its own police, while higher administrative levels—those
> of municipality and region—do not. Decentralized and
> deprofessionalized, police thus serve and are under control of the
> community that elects them."[^48]

Each community also has its own judicial council and, according to
Grubacic and O'Hearn, "has the freedom to decide on the specifics of the
punishment according to local context."[^49] Zapatistas say they almost
never imprison criminals. Instead, they generally assign community
service as a punishment. Neils Barmeyer has observed a prominent use of
fines as punishment in Zapatista communities.[^50]

There is an emphasis "on transformative rather than punitive justice.
The parties involved can negotiate on compensation, and when the
perpetrator has to take a loan from relatives to pay the fine, the
participation of the family helps prevent further transgressions."[^51]

Jails have not been abolished. However, "jail sentences normally do not
exceed several days" and "jail is usually just a locked room with a
partially open door so that people can stop by to chat and pass
food."[^52]

Gustavo Esteva argues that the Zapatista territories are “the safest
place in Mexico and perhaps one of the safest in the world.”[^53] In the
Zapatista communities, land is communally owned and no one goes hungry,
so one could argue that there is little to be gained from theft. With a
significant degree of control over their work, education, culture and
communities, the Zapatistas experience a comparably low level of
alienation. “There are only two men in jail in the whole of the
Zapatista area today,” Esteva said in a 2013 talk. “And these two guys
are in jail because they committed the worst possible crime. They were
cultivating marijuana. The problem in that case is not just the use of
marijuana. The problem is they can give the government a pretext to
attack the Zapatistas and to attack the communities.”.[^54]

## Revolution

Gloria Muñoz Ramírez maintains that since their public uprising in 1994,
the Zapatistas have combined popular organization with two alternating
strategies: fire and the word. Fire refers to “military actions,
preparations, battles, military movements.” The word refers to
“meetings, dialogues, communiqués”. According to Ramírez, the Zapatistas
primarily used fire from 1994-5, the word from 1996-7, fire in 1998 and
the word in 1999.[^55] The Zapatistas' refusal to take state power and
their commitment to a radically decentralized “world where many worlds
fit” signify a commitment to an anti-authoritarian strategy.

The results of the movement have been measurable from improved living
conditions at the local level to influencing politics at the national
and global level. As described above, the Zapatistas have constructed an
entire autonomous zone with significant libertarian leanings. At the
national level, the Zapatistas are widely credited as the cause of the
right-wing PRI's electoral loss in 2000, putting an end to the party's
consecutive seventy-one years of ruling Mexico.[^56]

The Zapatistas were instrumental in sparking and helping coordinate the
alter-globalization movement. At a 1998 conference the Zapatistas
organized in Barcelona, participants met and later went on to form
People's Global Action, the network that called for the mobilization
which shut down the 1999 World Trade Organization summit in Seattle. The
anthropologist and activist David Graeber argues in “The Shock of
Victory” that the alter-globalization movement helped bring about the
collapse of the Washington Consensus and defeated the ruling class’s
proposed Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.[^57]

Economists and some leftists contend that the Zapatista uprising helped
put the world economy into crisis in 1994-1995. *Wikipedia* explains
that "a violent uprising in the state of Chiapas, as well as the
assassination of the presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio,
resulted in political instability, causing investors to place an
increased risk premium on Mexican assets."[^58] Aldo Musacchio's Harvard
Business School working paper also lists the Zapatista rebellion as a
primary cause. In January of 1995, the United States government, IMF,
Bank for International Settlements and other banks spent a combined \$50
billion to bail out Mexico.[^59] Libertarian marxist John Holloway
concludes, "the impact of the Zapatista uprising on capital (through the
devaluation of the Mexican peso and the world financial upheaval of
1994-95, for example) makes it clear that the capacity to disrupt
capital accumulation does not depend necessarily on one's immediate
location in the process of production."[^60]

A 13 January 1995 Chase Bank memo displayed both the ruling class's
panic toward the Zapatistas and a willingness to violently "eliminate"
the movement:

> "While Chiapas, in our opinion, does not pose a fundamental threat to
> Mexican political stability, it is perceived to be so by many in the
> investment community. The government will need to eliminate the
> Zapatistas to demonstrate their effective control of the national
> territory and of security policy."[^61]

## 1994 Uprising

On January 1, 1994, thousands of armed Zapatistas occupied seven cities
in Chiapas, freed prisoners, burnerd down police headquarters, and took
over City Halls. Their army, commonly referred to by its Spanish
initials EZLN, issued a declaration of war against the Mexican state,
demanding “work, land, housing, food, health care, education,
independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace.”[^62] In the
uprising's first months, Zapatistas seized 1.2 to 1.7 million acres from
large landowners.[^63]

Although the Zapatistas declared themselves “the product of 500 years of
struggle”—a reference to indigenous people’s resistance since 1492—they
responded most immediately to the North American Free Trade Agreement,
or NAFTA. Taking effect that same day—January 1st, 1994—NAFTA promised
to devastate the peasant farmers’ livelihoods by flooding Mexico with
subsidized US corn. Worse, the negotiations leading to NAFTA compelled
Mexico to revoke Article 27 of its Constitution, which guaranteed
peasants a right to land for communally-owned farms called ejidos.
“Enough is enough,” they exclaimed in their declaration of war.[^64]

On January 6, the Zapatistas proposed a cease-fire. On January 12, hours
before 100,000 demonstrators filled Mexico City's central plaza
demanding an end to government hostilities, Mexico signed a peace treaty
with the Zapatistas.[^65] Since January 1994, the Zapatistas' struggle
has been almost entirely nonviolent. They retain a military and have
occasionally used it in self-defense, for example in San Juan in
1998.[^66]

## Encuentros

In 1996, the Zapatistas held a Continental Encuentro and then the First
Intercontinental Encuentro for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism, where
almost 5,000 people from 42 countries met to coordinate and advance the
global struggle against neoliberalism. “Encuentro” means encounter in
Spanish. [^67]

## Armador Hernandez

In the 1990s, the Mexican government wanted to build a highway in
Armador Hernandez through the Montes Azules bioreserve, which would be
used for the extraction of timber, uranium and oil. In August of 1999,
the Mexican army entered Armador Hernandez to enable the highway's
construction. For sixteen months, the Zapatistas kept up a
twenty-four-hour blockade, preventing construction. When Mexican
soldiers tried drowning out the protests with loud noise, the Zapatistas
“bombed” the military base with hundreds of paper airplanes. On December
22, 2000, the government ordered military withdrawal, and the highway
was defeated.[^68]

## Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee and the Zapatista National Liberation Army

The Zapatista National Liberation Army, (EZLN), receives orders from the
Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee (CCRI). Each Zapatista
community elects a *comite*, a civilian delegate to the CCRI. The local
CCRI delegates send representatives to the CCRI-General Command, which
has 70 to 80 members and is based near La Realidad.[^69] The CCRI does
not have the power to make major decisions over war and peace. These
decisions are made by a "consulta", a community-by-community discussion
referendum process that can take several months. Consultas have been
used to make decisions like proceeding with the 1994 uprising and
accepting the 1996 San Andrés Accords.[^70]

The EZLN itself is organized hierarchically, as Andrew Flood points out:

> The Zapatista military structure is not however internally democratic.
> Rather it is organised as a conventional army with officers apparently
> appointed from the top down. Some would argue that in a war situation
> a democratic structure is not possible. I would point to the
> Makhnovista of the Russian civil war and the anarchist militia of the
> Spanish Civil War as historical demonstrations that military systems
> where the rank and file select delegates to act as officers are
> feasible.[^71]

## Neighboring Societies

In violation of the 1996 San Andrés Accords, the Mexican government and
right-wing paramilitary groups have conducted a low-intensity terror
campaign against the Zapatistas and their supporters. In 1997, a
paramilitary group murdered 47 Zapatista supporters, mostly women and
children, in Acteal, with the tacit support of at least local levels of
government.[^72] In 2014, paramilitary members attacked La Realidad and
killed Zapatista community member Compañero Galeano.[^73]

Receiving no assistance from the Mexican government, the Zapaitstas have
heavily relied upon international solidarity. Peter Gelderloos writes,
“Thousands of volunteers and people with technical experience came from
around the world to help Zapatista communities build up their
infrastructure, and thousands of others continue to support the
Zapatistas by sending donations of money and equipment or buying
fair-trade goods produced in the autonomous territory. This assistance
is given in a spirit of solidarity; most importantly, it is on the
Zapatista’s own terms. This contrasts starkly with the model of
