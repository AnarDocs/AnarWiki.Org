## Origins

In response to "<a   href="Salvador_Allende.md" class="wikilink"
title="Salvador Allende&#39;s">"Salvador Allende's</a> efforts to
nationalise US-owned copper mines (to fund a larger
"<a   href="Welfare_State.md" class="wikilink" title="welfare state">"welfare
state</a>) and grassroots efforts to create
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">"workers' self-management</a>. The
US supported the military and a mass campaign of disinformation in order
to topple the government, killing Allende and imposing a new regime that
dissolved parliament, banned trade unions, censored the media and
unleashed a wave of brutal authoritarianism.[^1]

## Foreign Relations

## Crimes Against Humanity

The dictatorship committed numerous crimes against humanity and
instituted a reign of terror to purge Chile of leftists, killing between
2,000 and 30,000 people, 27,000 people being tortured (and survived) and
200,000 people were forced into exile (mainly to
"<a   href="Argentina.md" class="wikilink" title="Argentina">"Argentina</a>).
In other words, 2.2% of Chile's population (of 10.1 million) had their
lives ended or ruined by the dictatorship.[^2]

The [National
Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Nacional_Julio_Mart%C3%ADnez_Pr%C3%A1danos)
in Santiago was converted into a detention centre (one of 80 in
Santiago), over 40,000 people were held there over 17 years, with the
locker rooms and changing rooms were where prisoners were first to sleep
and torture and executions were performed in the velodrome (including
killing two American journalists,
"<a   href="Frank_Teruggi_Jr..md" class="wikilink"
title="Frank Teruggi Jr.">"Frank Teruggi Jr.</a> and
"<a   href="Charles_Horman.md" class="wikilink" title="Charles Horman">"Charles
Horman</a>). Other buildings were converted into secret detention
centres, and horrors occurred in all of them. Some of these horrors
include:

- Electrocution of open wounds and the genitals on a person tied up on a
  metal bed.[^3]
- Arresting entire families if a single member had leftist sympathies,
  and forcing family members to watch soldiers rape other members of
  their family, in other situations, families or close friends would
  have to listen to their beloved being tortured.[^4]
- Forcing prisoners to crawl on the ground and lick the dirt off the
  floors. If the prisoners complained or even collapsed from exhaustion,
  they were promptly executed.[^5]
- Forcing prisoners to swim in vats of 'excrement (shit) and eat and
  drink it.[^6]
- Forcing prisoners to stay awake for five days while lying down,
  threatening to kill their children if they didn't.
- Forcing prisoners to lie down and driving trucks and cars over their
  arms and legs, crushing their bones.[^7]
- Beating prisoners to the point that they'd either be deaf from being
  hit on the ears or have broken arms and legs, occasionally, amputation
  would be used as a torture technique.[^8]
- Pouring water over a cloth that covered prisons' faces and breathing
  passages, causing individuals to experience a drowning sensation, and
  a near-death experience and killing many through asphyxiation.[^9]
- Prisoners were hung upside-down with ropes, and they were dropped into
  a tank of water, headfirst. The water was contaminated (with poisonous
  chemicals, shit and piss) and filled with debris.[^10]
- Anal rape of prisoners by soldiers while soldiers insulted them to
  break their spirit.[^11]
- Using dogs to rape prisoners and inserting rats into prisoners anuses
  and vaginas.[^12]
- Forcing female prisoners to engage in sex with their brothers and
  fathers at gunpoint.[^13]
- Throwing dissidents from helicopters into the ocean, rivers, lakes or
  mountains where they would be instantly killed (and spend the last
  seconds of their live in absolute terror) and their bodies never
  found.[^14] This method of torture is continuously joked about in
  online right-wing spaces as their 'joking' plan for leftists.[^15]
- Many victims reported suffering from "<a   href="PTSD.md" class="wikilink"
  title="post traumatic stress disorder">"post traumatic stress
  disorder</a>, isolation, worthlessness,
  "<a   href="shame.md" class="wikilink" title="shame">"shame</a>,
  "<a   href="anxiety.md" class="wikilink" title="anxiety">"anxiety</a> and
  hopelessness.[^16]

## Resistance

Various organisations were set up to resist the dictatorship, notably
three main guerilla groups, the Lautaro Youth Movement (MJL), Manuel
Rodríguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) and Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR).
All three of these were strongly inspired by
"<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">"Marxist-Leninist</a> ideals. To give a short
(and incomplete) timeline of their actions:

- 1973: Leftists fight the army in the streets to return to the regime
  of Allende and defeat the coup, over 1,500 people die in the street
  fighting in the days after the coup (including using the airforce to
  bomb streets and buildings holding leftist guerillas). The stronghold
  at the University of Chile is sieged and eventually taken by the army.
- 1973: Leftist snipers kill 13 soldiers in the Chilean countryside near
  Alquihue in Valdivia.
- 1986: FPMR kidnap a police chief for 48 hours and send footage of his
  imprisonment to TV stations, leading to condemnation and the release
  of the police chief.
- 1986: FPMR attack Pinochet's car in an assassination attempt. Five of
  Pinochet's bodyguards were killed and eleven wounded. Pinochet,
  however, only suffered minor injuries.
- 1986: FPMR are caught smuggling numerous weapons into Chile, including
  plastic explosives, rocket launchers and over three thousand assault
  rifles.
- 1987: FPMR simultaneously assaulted the offices of Associated Press
  (AP) and eight radio stations in Santiago, killing an off-duty
  security guard.
- 1987: Leftists blow up a police car in Santiago, killing the two
  officers inside it.
- 1988: MIR bomb several banks across Santiago.
- 1988: FPMR kill a 41-year old Lieutenant-Colonel in a parking lot in
  San Joaquín, Santiago.
- 1988: Leftist militants bomb a church in Valparaíso, injuring three
  churchgoers.
- 1988: FPMR "<a   href="Chilean_Uprising_(1988).md" class="wikilink"
  title="takes control of four towns">"takes control of four towns</a> in
  the country, (Aguas Grandes, La Mora, Los Queñes and Pichipellahuén)
  and resists police and military efforts to take them back, but
  retreats after significant fighting.
- 1989: A 26-year old soldier is shot and killed at point blank range
  while guarding a building in Viña del Mar.
- 1989: MIR plans to kidnap 30 business executives in Chile of
  "<a   href="Brazil.md" class="wikilink" title="Brazilian">"Brazilian</a> and
  "<a   href="Canada.md" class="wikilink" title="Canadian">"Canadian</a>
  descent, but fails after it is detected by Canadian intelligence
  agencies.
