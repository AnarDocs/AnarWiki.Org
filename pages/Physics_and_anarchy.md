Physics, the science of matter and energy, has offered a range of
political implications as a discipline, from authoritarian to anarchist.
On the authoritarian end, classical physicists have employed mechanistic
philosophies to describe human and nonhuman nature as basically
manipulable machines. Modern physicists have developed technologies of
war and control, most notably the intertwined technologies of nuclear
weaponry and nuclear power. Today, some physicists work on other
catastrophic and authoritarian technologies such as geoengineering and
nanotechnology. Still, physics arguably has an anarchist side that finds
self-organization and cooperation embedded throughout the cosmos.

Some anarchists have found inspiration in findings in post-Newtonian
physics that suggest the universe may be much more self-organizing,
spontaneous, and interconnected than Newtonian physics suggested. The
theory of general relativity can be seen as a blow to the Newtonian
worldview of a dead, mechanistic universe that, as science historian
Carolyn Merchant has pointed out, helped capitalists rationalize the
exploitation and colonization of nature.[^1] Scientists have found
self-organization in the supposedly inanimate world, everywhere from
cloud formations to the formation of galaxies. The unpredictability of
quantum mechanics arguably provides a better grounding for free will
than predictable Newtonian mechanics did. Theories of a multiverse
(multiple universes) offer non-theistic explanations for why our solar
system and universe are so conveniently suited for life, without making
recourse to any Creator dominating over the cosmos. Chaos theory has
caught the attention of anarchists interested in the universe's
spontaneity and unpredictability. Such findings and theories in modern
physics provide compelling metaphors, at least, for those interested in
mutual aid, sustainability, and horizontal societies.

Social philosophies in every age draw from the physics of their time, as
the physicist Nick Herbert explains:

> In the Middle Ages, when virtually everyone believed the world to be
> the personal creation of a divine being, society mirrored the
> hierarchy that supposedly existed in the heavens. Dante's picture of
> the world...gave everything and everyone his proper place in the
> medieval scheme of things... Coincident with the rise of the Newtonian
> physics was the ascent of the modern democracy which stresses a 'rule
> of laws rather than men'...The Declaration of Independence, for
> example, 'we hold these truths to be self-evident' reads more like a
> mathematical theorem than a political document.[^2]

Peter Kropotkin thought that the Newtonian worldview had a certain
anarchistic potential, particularly in how in described the world
without recourse to religious concepts.[^3] However, Errico Malateta
criticized Kropotkin's argument as naive and unconvincing, since the
Newtonian conception of human beings as merely complicated machines did
not leave much room for free will and consequent ethical ideals of
freedom.[^4]

Before proceeding, it is important to note that there is a danger in
extrapolating social ideals from physics, a risk of anthropomorphizing
atoms and oversimplifying human societies, of finding false affinities
between very different phenomena. Rudolf Rocker implores in *Nationalism
and Culture* that society has no set of basic scientific laws akin to
those followed by basic particles of matter. “The assertion that the
destiny of social structures is determinable according to the laws of a
so-called 'social physics' is of no greater significance than the claim
of those wise women who pretend to be able to read the destinies of man
in tea cups or in the lines of the hands,” Rocker writes.[^5] Worse,
there is a tendency among some non-scientists to misrepresent physics in
order to derive mystical-sounding conclusions. The website *Rational
Wiki* warns that there is an entire industry of “quantum woo,” defined
as “the justification of irrational beliefs by an obfuscatory reference
to quantum physics”.[^6]

# Anarchist themes

"I almost want to say *freedom is the goal of the universe*," writes
Abdullah Öcalan. According to the incarcerated Kurdish freedom fighter,
the spontaneity and diversity of all things indicate a striving for
freedom throughout nature. He elaborates, "When I think of the
particle-energy duality that is the cornerstone of the universe, I would
without hesitation emphasize that energy is freedom \[...\] Can it be
denied that the flutter of the bird in a cage is a flutter for freedom?
What other concept could explain the twitter of a nightingale in a cage,
more beautiful than any symphony, but the desire for freedom? If we go a
step further, don't all of the sounds and colors of the universe make us
think of freedom? Can the struggle of women, the first and last slaves,
who have experienced the most profound slavery of human society, be
explained by anything other than their quest for freedom?"[^7]

Drawing on the science of ecology, the anarchist Murray Bookchin defines
“libertarian” with reference to principles he saw in nature: “unity in
diversity, spontaneity, and complementary relationships, free from all
hierarchy and domination”.[^8] Working from this definition, this
article asks whether the universe as understood by contemporary physics
displays tendencies that might be considered libertarian. Specifically,
it explores whether physics finds the universe to follow these
principles of unity in diversity, spontaneity, complementary
relationships, and freedom from hierarchy.

From the perspective of cosmologist Brian Swimme, the universe does
follow a similar set of principles. In his books *The Universe Story*
and *Journey of the Universe*--coauthored with Thomas Berry and Mary
Evelyn Tucker respectively, he says the universe is ordered by (1)
differentiation, (2) self-organization, and (3) communion.[^9] These
principles correspond to the first three enumerated above by Bookchin
and imply the fourth. The approach of Swimme, and some of the
complementary approaches discussed below, arguably presents a picture of
a fairly anarchistic universe.

## Diversity

According to Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry, the universe has tended to
move toward ever-increasing diversity of things and beings. First, there
was a "fireball." Then there emerged the universe, then stars, then
planets, then very simple life forms, then more complex life forms, then
human societies. There is tremendous diversity among galaxies, among
planets, among species, among communities. "There has never been a time
when the universe did not seek further differentiation."[^10]

The biologist Stuart Kauffman argues, in *Humanity in a Creative
Universe*, that the universe is nonergodic, or non-repeating, meaning
that the universe's physical and chemical particles assemble in
increasingly complex ways: "Briefly, as more complex things and linked
processes are created, and can combine with one another in ever more new
ways to make yet more complex amalgrams of things and processes, the
space of possible things and linked processes becomes vastly larger and
the universe has not had time to make all the possibilities."[^11]

## Spontaneity

The universe's physical structures self-organize, creating spontaneous
orders such as the oscillations of electromagnetic waves and the
formation of stars and planets. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a
central tenet of quantum mechanics, shows that events cannot be
definitively predicted in advance, and therefore, humans are never
entirely slaves to a predetermined destiny. Even at the level of
subatomic particles, the spontaenity of movement might suggest a sort of
freedom, as the physicist Richard Feynman reportedly noted, the electron
"does anything it likes."[^12] See the section below on quantum physics
for elaboration on these princples.

When subatomic particles collide, they often transform in bizarre and
creative ways. Attributing a playful creativity to these particles, the
physicist Fritjof Capra argues, "all matter, whether here on Earth or in
outer space, is involved in a continual cosmic dance."[^13]

Swimme and Mary Evelyn Tucker describe the universe's development as a
story of self-organization and increasing complexity, from the
spontaneous emergence of galaxies to the spontaneous evolution of life.
They write:

> Once a galactic system has been evoked, we can find self-organizing
> stars within the galaxy. And once we have stars, we can find
> self-assembling planets such as Earth, with its own organizing
> substructures such as hurricanes or whirlpools. Then and only then is
> there the possibility for a new self-organizing system, a living cell,
> to come forth.[^14]

Neil D. Theise and Menas C. Kafatos describe the entire universe as a
series of self-organizing networks, all the way down to the subatomic
scale. They assert that the universe follows of a logic of "quenched
disorder," meaning it exhibits a spontaneity that characterizes complex
systems as opposed to programmed machines, which *qua machines* do not
exemplify self-organization:

> \[M\]olecules in turn arise from self-organizing atoms (with quenched
> disorder now being supplied by quantum mechanical processes), atoms
> themselves arise from self-organizing subatomic particles and so on,
> down to the Planck scale where the smallest entities ("strings" or
> otherwise) do not arise from anything smaller, but appear and
> disappear from the energetic vacuum in a "quantum foam."[^15]

## Complementary Relationships

Rejecting hyper-individualistic social philosophies, anarchists
understand the individual self as embedded in community, and this
understanding leads anarchists to deepen their solidaristic connections
with the people and environments around them.[^16] Aspects of modern
physics suggest that everything is connected and that any particular
being or object is heavily shaped by its relationship to the physical
world.

Just moments after the Big Bang, particles began bonding and communing
with each other. This bonding between particles caused the development
of all complex structures in the universe. Swimme and Tucker observe,
“Even from the first moments, our universe moved toward creating
relationships \[...\] This bonding is at the heart of matter.”[^17]

As summarized by Freya Mathews, Einstein's General Relativity Theory
views the universe as "a single, cosmic field."[^18] For more, see the
section on "Holistic Implications of Relativity."

In the words of physicist David Bohm, “The inseparable quantum
interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental
reality.”[^19] Several strands of research, explored throughout this
article, support this view of interconnectedness. Particles on opposite
sides of the universe are sometimes “entangled” with each other, meaning
that the direction one spins affects the direction the other spins.
According to the Many-Worlds explanations of quantum physics, a
subatomic movement anywhere in the universe can instantly create a copy
of the rest of the universe. Path integral formation says that each
quantum-scale particle travels everywhere in space-time all the time,
creating a giant cosmic dance connecting all things to each other. The
uncertainty principle has convinced scientists that there is no way to
definitively determine where one object ends and another begins, and
thus the universe must be understood as an assortment of interrelated
processes rather than an assortment of separate things. Chaos theory
shows how small actions can have dramatic effects in distant places,
further demonstrating an interconnectedness of all things.

This relatedness of all things could have either authoritarian or
libertarian interpretations, depending on the type of relatedness. It is
authoritarian if it entirely merges the individual into the universe,
sacrificing individuality. It can be anti-authoritarian, however, if it
is based in unity in diversity and thus strengthens both the individual
and the whole at the same time.[^20] Contemporary physics, it could be
argued, represents the latter, libertarian possibility. The
interconnections of the universe do not imply a conformity of objects.
To the contrary, findings suggest that since the Big Bang, the
ever-expanding universe has constantly been forming different objects,
relations, and spawning a nearly infinite variety of parallel worlds.

## Freedom from Domination

Although there are a number of religious anti-authoritarian movements
and societies, Anarchists influenced by Bakunin often extend their
rejection of domination to a rejection of God, who, they say, should be
opposed like any other ruler. “\[I\]f God really existed, it would be
necessary to abolish him,” argued Bakunin.[^21] Newton had invoked a
creator, as explained above, to explain the formation of the universe.
Contemporary physics, however, offers explanations that seem to enable a
satisfying non-theistic physics much like natural selection enables a
non-theistic biology. Therefore, contemporary physics, moreso than
Newtonian physics, may portray nonhuman nature as lacking a cosmological
hierarchy and domination.

In many ways, the solar system and universe appear finely-tuned to
support intelligent life, and some have consequently argued that there
must have been a conscious creator. If the Earth's orbit were a little
less circular and more elliptical, then winter would get too cold and
summer too hot for life. If the sun were a little closer or bigger,
Earth would be too hot, and if the sun were a little farther or smaller,
then Earth would be too cold. Going further, the universe itself has
certain conditions that seem “tailor-made to support us,” according to
Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.[^22] Small changes in the forces
of nature would prevent carbon, the basis of life as we know it, from
forming inside stars and then being distributed through space when the
stars explode. If the universe’s strong nuclear force were changed by
0.5% or the electrical force changed by 4%, this would destroy either
nearly all carbon or all oxygen in every star. If the weak nuclear force
were weaker, all the hydrogen in early universe would have turned to
helium and there would be no normal stars. If it were much stronger,
exploding stars wouldn’t eject carbon through space.

Theories of contemporary physics--String theory, M theory, and the Many
Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics--have led many scientists to
believe that our universe is just one of many that exist in a
multiverse. Consequently, the existence of a planet "finely-tuned" for
life seems statistically likely given the nearly infinite number of
planets spread out over multiple universes. M theory says there are as
many as 10^500 different universes. As a result, it is much less
shocking that at least one solar system, ours, has the apparently
miraculous conditions that could support intelligent life. Since there
are many different universes and so many different solar systems within
each of them, it is more understandable that at least one of solar
system can support life, even if the vast majority do not. In response
to developments in M theory, Hawking has written, “It is not necessary
to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the Universe
going.”[^23] As Darwin's theory of natural selection provided biologists
with a non-theological explanation for the apparently unlikely existence
of complex life, the multiverse can provide physicists with an
explanation for the apparently unlikely existence of the physical
conditions necessary for life.

One parallel between contemporary physics and Anarchist theory involves
decentralization. Anarchists argue that society should be decentralized
so that each community can organize itself; while there is extensive
worldwide coordination and mutual aid in Anarchist visions, society has
no single center. Likewise, physicists' understanding of the existence
of many galaxies suggests that the universe is highly decentralized.
Swimme and Tucker explain, "For what we have come to realize is that
there is not one center, but millions. Each supercluster of galaxies is
at the very center of the expansion of the universe. We live in a
multicentered universe and are only now awakening to this new
discovery."[^24] Theories of the multiverse go even further and suggest
that our universe is just one of many. While some traditions may see a
particular city or country as the "center" of everything, contemporary
scientists' understanding challenges such views and present instead a
radically decentralized universe and multiverse.

# Self-organization

Self-organization is a process of spontaneous order self-created by the
components of a system. These systems can be seen as anarchistic, since
they are orderly without having any external governing body. The
physicist Hermann Haken lists examples of self-organizing physical
systems:

> ` * Formation of spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal patterns. We mention a few examples.`
>
> ` * Lasers: coherent light, self-organization of many atoms`
>
> ` * Nonlinear optics: coherent light, self-focusing, generation of harmonics, coherent Raman and Brillouin scattering, etc.`
>
> ` * Fluid dynamics, gas dynamics: cloud streets, convection instability, Taylor-Couette flow, roll patterns, hexagonal patterns (Bénard cells), weak turbulences, defects, etc.`

# Relativity

Relativity theory marked a shift from the Newtonian worldview of a
static, dead universe to a new view of a dynamic, expanding universe in
which space and time are interrelated with all the universe's bodies and
forces. As Stephen Hawking explains:

> Space and time are now dynamic quantities: when a body moves or a
> force acts, it affects the curvature of space and time—and in turn the
> structure of space-time affects the way in which bodies move and
> forces act. Space and time not only affect but also are affected by
> everything that happens in the universe.[^26]

Einstein's concept of relativity came in two parts, a “special theory of
relativity” in 1905 and a “general theory of relativity” in 1915. The
special theory of relativity responded to James Clerk Maxwell, who had
found light travels at the same speed for all observers. The problem
with Maxwell's finding was that it could not explain how different
people can observe a single beam of light travelling at different
speeds. Suppose someone turns on a flashlight on a moving train. A
person on the train will see the beam of light move merely from one end
of the car to another, but someone standing outside the train will see
the beam of light, along with the train, moving many times the length of
the car.

How can the speed of light be constant when the two observers saw the
same beam of light moving two different differences at apparently the
same time? One explanation was that empty space was full of a substance
called ether and that the speed of light should be measured in relation
to it. When the scientists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley tried to
test the ether theory, however, they found no evidence of any such
substance existing.

In 1905, Albert Einstein, a “hitherto unknown clerk in the Swiss patent
office” published his special theory of relativity, which asserted that
the laws of science for all freely moving observers are the same, no
matter their speed. One consequence of his theory was that there is no
such thing as absolute time. “\[I\]f the observer on the train shone a
flashlight, the two observers would disagree on the distance the light
travelled. Since speed is distance divided by time, if they disagree on
the distance the light has travelled, the only way for them to agree on
the speed is for them to also disagree about the time the trip has
taken,. In other words, the theory of relativity requires us to put an
end to the idea of absolute time! Instead, each observer must have his
own measure of time, as recorded by a clock carried with him, and
identical clocks carried by different observers need not agree.”[^27]

In 1915, Einstein published his general theory of relativity, which
unlike the special theory, applied to gravity. The main postulate of
Einstein's general theory of relativity was that in small enough regions
of space, it is impossible to tell whether you are at rest in a
gravitational field or uniformly accelerating in empty space. The
far-reaching impacts of this theory can be seen in the “twin paradox”.
Suppose one twin boards a spaceship that accelerates to nearly the speed
of light and the other twin stays on earth. When the first twin returns
from space, she will be younger than the twin who stayed on earth, since
she experienced less time than the person who stayed on earth. “Our
biological clocks are equally affected by these changes in the flow of
time,” explains Hawking.[^28]

Einstein's equations imply that the universe contained zero matter at
some point in the distant past, about 13.7 billion years ago. In
contrast to Newtonian physics, relativity theory implies that the
universe is expanding. For all its explanatory power, general relativity
could not explain the big bang, when the universe was reduced to a
single point. Scientists developed a new branch of physics, quantum
mechanics, to explain phenomenon occurring on the very smallest
scale.[^29]

## Holistic implications of relativity?

Freya Mathews summarizes that Einstein's scientific worldview saw the
universe as an "all-pervasive medium, a medium analogous to a fluid, in
which the currents and waves are ‘forces’ and the vortices are ‘matter’.
We ourselves are complex ripples propagating in its depths.[^30]

In a 1950 letter to a grieving father, Einstein himself indicated that
he saw the universe as holistic, although he did not specify whether or
how this view was related to his scientific research:

> A human being is a part of the whole, called by us "Universe", a part
> limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and
> feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical
> delusion of his consciousness. The striving to free oneself from this
> delusion is the one issue of true religion. Not to nourish the
> delusion but to try to overcome it is the way to reach the attainable
> measure of peace of mind.[^31]

The philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell thought relativity
theory should lead scientists to adopt a form of methodological holism,
understanding the world as a collection of processes rather than
entirely divisible objects:

> From all this it seems to follow that events, not particles, must be
> the 'stuff' of physics. What has been thought of as a particle will
> have to be thought of as a series of events....Thus 'matter' is not
> part of the ultimate material of the world, but merely a convenient
> way of collecting events into bundles.[^32]

# Quantum Mechanics

In 1900, the scientist Max Planc argued that light and other
electromagnetic waves consisted of packets called quanta. A branch of
physics called “quantum mechanics” emerged, which describes what occurs
at the smallest scale of the universe. One of the most startling aspects
of quantum mechanics is Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which
said that the position and velocity of a quantum-scale particle prior to
its measurement can never be determined. Heisenberg noted that in order
to measure the speed and velocity of any particle, you need to shine a
light on it. If you shine a light with a high wavelength, you can
measure the particle's velocity but you can't measure its precise
location. To find the precise position, you need to use a light with a
short wavelength. The problem is that when you shoot light at the
particle, the light affects the particle's velocity. The shorter the
wavelength, the more the light affects the particle's velocity. So, the
more accurately you measure the particle's position, the less accurately
you can measure what its velocity was. The uncertainty principle shows
that scientists cannot predict with certainty the movement of particles.
Hawking writes, “One of the revolutionary properties of quantum
mechanics is that it does not predict a single definite result for an
observation. Instead, it predicts a number of possible outcomes and
tells us how likely each of these is.”[^33]

It may be tempting to think that the particle actually has a definite
position and velocity all along and that the measurement merely disturbs
a particle which had a definite state prior to measurement. Nick Herbert
calls this view the “disturbance model”. However, phenomen such as
quantum entanglement contradict the disturbance model. The position and
velocity of objects are actually probabilistic in a way that has
required scientists to explore new conceptions of reality.[^34]

## Path integral formulation

One of the consequences of the uncertainty principle is the concept of
particle-wave duality. The tiniest bits of matter behave both like
particles and like waves. Fire electrons — normally thought of as
particles — at a wall with two slits, and the electrons will interfere
with each other as if they were waves of light. The screen on the other
side of the wall will show a pattern that looks like a wave was sent
through the two slits. Remarkably, the same result occurs if the
electrons are fired one at a time. Hawking and Mlodinow explains, "Each
electron, therefore, must be passing through both slits at the same time
and interfering with itself!"[^35]

Richard Feynman's “path integral formulation” theory provides a
framework for understanding how quantum objects can make up larger
bodies like basketballs and boomerangs that conform to to classical laws
of motion. According to Feynman, each particle takes every possible path
in the universe, including through both slits. Hawking and Mlodinow
summarize:

> “In the double-slit experiment Feynman's ideas mean that particles
> take paths that go through only one slit or the other; paths that
> thread through the first slit, back out through the second slit, and
> then through the first again; paths that visit the restaurant that
> serves that great curried shrimp, and then circle Jupiter a few times
> before heading home; even paths that go across the universe and
> back.[^36]

With larger objects, it turns out, paths tend to cancel each other out
except for the one predicted by Newtonian physics. Hence large objects
move just as Newton's theory predicts they will.[^37] Feynman's theory
implies that at every moment, you travel everywhere in the universe. In
the words of physicist Michio Kaku:

> \[A\]s odd as it may seem, every time you walk across the room,
> somehow your body 'sniffs out' all possible paths ahead of time, even
> those extending to the distant quasars and the big bang, and then adds
> them up... When I first learned of Feynman's point of view as a
> graduate student, it changed my entire mental picture of the
> universe...it was the idea that I am in some sense sniffing out paths
> that take me to Mars or to the distant stars as I walk across the room
> that altered my worldview. Suddenly, I had a strange new mental
> picture of myself living in a quantum world.[^38]

## Quantum Entanglement

Two quantum objects can become entangled, in such a way that when one
spins in one direction, the other instantly spins in the opposite
direction. In 1935, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen
made an argument against quantum mechanics, saying that if two particles
were entangled and then shot in opposite directions at a distance, one
would have to be able to somehow send information to the other faster
than the speed of light. Einstein ridiculed this communication as
impossible “spooky action at a distance.”

With “Bell's theorem,” physicist John Stewart Bell calculated that if
quantum mechanics were correct the two particles would be correlated one
way, while if Einstein and other skeptics were correct the particles
would be correlated another way. Experimentation with entangled
particles proved the quantum mechanicists correct and Einstein
wrong.[^39]

The entanglement of particles across the universe implies a much
stronger interconnectedness across galaxies than Newtonian physics
envisioned. As Kaku writes,

> There is a cosmic “entanglement” between every atom of our body and
> atoms that are light-years distant. Since all matter came from a
> single explosion, the big bang, in some sense the atoms of our body
> are linked with some atoms on the other side of the universe in some
> kind of cosmic quantum web. Entangled particles are somewhat like
> twins still joined by an umbilical cord (their wave function) which
> can be light-years across. What happens to one member automatically
> affects the other, and hence knowledge concerning one particle can
> instantly reveal knowledge about its pair. Entangled pairs act as if
> they were a single object, although they may be separated by a large
> distance. (More precisely, since the wave functions of the particles
> in the big bang were once connected and coherent, their wave functions
> might still be partially connected billions of years after the big
> bang, so that disturbances in one part of the wave function can
> influence another distant part of the wave function.)[^40]

According to Nick Herbert, “Bell's theorem shows that the holistic
grammar of the quantum formalism reflects the inseparable nature of
reality itself. Beneath phenomena, the world is a seamless whole.”[^41]
Herbert later concludes:

> “Religion assures us that we are all brothers and sisters, children of
> the same deity; biologists say that we are intertwined with all
> life-forms on this planet: our fortunes rise or fall with theirs. Now
> physicists have discovered that the very atoms of our bodies are woven
> out of a superliminal fabric.”[^42]

More cautiously, Richard Healey in the *Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy*, writes, “Superficially, such entanglement of systems
already demonstrates nonseparability. At a deeper level, it has been
maintained that the puzzling statistics that arise from measurements on
entangled quantum systems either demonstrate, or are explicable in terms
of, holism or nonseparability rather than any problematic action at a
distance”.[^43]

## Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics

The “Schrödinger's cat” thought experiment helps illustrate a number of
ways that quantum physicists understand reality. Suppose that inside of
a box, there is a cat, an atom of uranium, a Geiger counter, a hammer,
and a bottle of poison gas. If the atom decays, it sets off a Geiger
counter which launches the hammer, which breaks the bottle of poison
gas, killing the cat. There’s no way to predict ahead of time whether
the uranium will decay or not, since the decaying is a quantum event.
According to some interpretations, prior to measurement the cat exists
in a quantum state, or wavefunction, where it is both alive and dead at
the same time.[^44]

*Rational Wiki* warns, “It's best not to take the experiment literally
and at face value as that can lead to some extreme misconceptions about
quantum mechanics. At best, the superposition can represent our
uncertainty and our lack of knowledge about the state of the cat. So the
'dead and alive' interpretation is true only on a metaphysical and
probabilistic level—to mistake it as a physical reality for the cat is a
different matter entirely.”[^45] The article goes on to point out the
the cat itself, or even the Geiger counter, can be interpreted as an
“observer” that collapses the quantum state well before a scientist
opens the box.[^46]

## Many Worlds Interpretation

The Many Worlds Interpretation, proposed in 1957 by Hugh Everett III,
says “the cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into
two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is
alive. In fact, at each quantum juncture, the universe splits in half,
in a never-ending sequence of splitting universes.”[^47] Michael Clive
Price's *The Everett FAQ* describes the splitting of worlds during a
variation of the Schrodinger thought experiment:

> `A cat is placed in a sealed box with a device that releases a lethal does of cyanide if a certain radioactive decay is detected...According to many-worlds the device was split into two states (cyanide released or not) by the radioactive decay, which is a thermodynamically irreversible process...As the cyanide/no-cyanide interacts with the cat the cat is split into two states (dead or alive)...The investigator splits when they open the box.`[^48]

The advantage of the Many Worlds Interpretation is that it does not
require the wavefunction to collapse, making it simpler than competing
theories like the Copenhagen Interpretation.[^49]

Although Bell's theorem does not apply to the Many Worlds
Interpretation, Everett's worldview still implies an interconnectedness
of things across the universe. Nick Herbert elaborates:

> Any model of reality in which a tiny event in the Andromeda galaxy can
> instantly split my reality into thousands of Xerox copies cannot by
> any stretch of the imagination be called 'local.'[^50]

The Everett worldview has some poetic affinities with the Zapatistas'
concept of “a world where many worlds fit” and the alter-globalization
slogan “another world is possible”. It also allows for the *anthropic
principle* to explain plausibly how the universe developed the specific
conditions for life without divine intervention. See further discussion
on the multiverse in the section on “A multiverse without Gods or
masters” and in the section on M theory.

## Copenhagen Interpretation

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics says that “there is
no deep reality” prior to measurement and that it is the act of
measurement “collapses” the wavefunction of an object into a definite
state. It is measurement, then, that makes the cat either dead or
alive.[^51] N. David Mermin explains the implication, “we now know that
the moon is not there when nobody looks.”[^52]

In his 1975 book *The Tao of Physics*, physicist Fritjof Capra used the
Copenhagen interpretation to argue that everything in the universe is
connected. The core of his argument rests on the uncertainty principle.
Since no one object can exist in a non-quantum state without being
observed, Capra argues, no object can be understood in isolation from
other the observer.

> Quantum theory thus reveals an essential interconnectedness of the
> universe. It shows that we cannot decompose the world into
> independently existing smaller units. As we penetrate into matter, we
> find that it is made of particles, but these are not the 'basic
> building blocks' in the sense of Democritus and Newton. They are
> merely idealizations which are useful from a practical point of view,
> but have no fundamental significance. In the words of Neils Bohr,
> 'Isolated material particles are abstractions, their properties being
> definable and observable only through their interactions with other
> systems.[^53]

Capra's book is controversial among scientists. *Rational Wiki* gives a
literature review:

> Many who acknowledged Capra had described quantum physics fairly
> though his correlations between it and Buddhist mysticism were
> superficial and silly, and Peter Woit noted the book used quite a bit
> of out-of-date physics. Physicist John Gribbin described The Tao of
> Physics as the only purveyor of quantum-based mysticism that had any
> genuine grasp of quantum physics at all, although the book's physics
> has been severely criticized by Victor Stenger.[^54]

Contrary to Capra, the physicist Steven Weinberg argues the Copenhagen
does not preclude a deterministic view of the universe. Even though the
position and velocity of a particle cannot be known, Weinberg writes,
the wave function can be known: "By repeating measurements many times
for the same initial state, you can work out what the wave function in
the state must be and use the results to check your theories....Any
system is in a definite state *whether any humans are observing it or
not*' the state is not described by a position or a momentum but by a
wave function."[^55]

However, many quantum physicists appear to share Capra's commitment to a
methodology that recognizes the impossibility of reducing the universe
into separate, definite objects. Hawking and Mlodinow share Capra's
belief that it is impossible to understand any object without
understanding how the observer interacts with it and affects it. They
explain, “According to quantum physics, you cannot 'just' observe
something. That is, quantum physics recognizes that to make an
observation, you must interact with the object you are observing.”[^56]

## David Bohm's interpretation

Offering an alternative to both the Many Worlds Interpretation and the
Copenhagen interpretation, David Bohm believes the universe is an
undivided whole. He wrote, “One is led to a new notion of unbroken
wholeness which denies the classical analyzability of the world into
separately and independently existing parts..The inseparable quantum
interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental
reality.”[^57]

# String theory and M theory

While relativity theory describes phenomenon at a large scale and
quantum mechanics describes them on a small scale, neither theory can
completely explain the universe. Specifically, gravity does not conform
to quantum mechanics. Scientists have searched for a quantum theory of
gravity that combines the insights of relativity and quantum mechanics.

String theory, invented in the 1960s, attempts to provide a unified
theory of physics. It suggests that particles are actually vibrations on
strings that are curled up into up to twenty-six dimensions. We never
notice the extra dimensions (beyond the four we inhabit: length, width,
depth and time), since they are curled up into a million million million
million millionth of an inch.[^58]

In the 1990s, some physicists decided that string theories all belong to
a more fundamental theory called M theory.[^59] Stephen Hawking and
Leonard Mlodinow write that M theory is “the only candidate for a
complete theory of the universe”.[^60] M theory says that there are 11
dimensions and as many as 10^500 parallel universes.[^61]

A consequence of there being many universes is that it becomes much more
explicable that our solar system (one of many galaxies in many
universes) has the very unlikely combination of physical conditions for
life to develop. See the discussion in “A multiverse without Gods or
Masters”. As with the Many Worlds Interpretation, M theory has an
implication of non-local connectedness, where an observer on one end of
the universe can spark the formation of a modified replica of the entire
universe.

Finally, the existence of further dimensions allows for a possible
connectedness unnoticed in the first four dimensions. “If these
additional dimensions are appropriately considered spatial,
then...processes involving classical springs...would count as
(spatiotemporally) nonseparable, even though all particles and their
properties conform to spatial separability.”[^62]

# Chaos theory

A branch of physics involved in “chaos theory” has shown that the
universe may be even more spontaneous and resistant to mechanistic
explanation than has been previously understood. As *Wikipedia* notes,
chaos theory considers systems (anything from weather to evolution) to
follow “widely diverging” patterns that, while deterministic, are
impossible to predict."[^63] Edward Lorenz summarizes the theory,
“Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate
present does not approximately determine the future.”[^64]

Chaos theory shows that small actions anywhere can affect big changes in
distant places, demonstrating the complementary relationship of all
things. The famous "Butterfly effect" says that a butterfly flapping its
wings in Peking can influence a storm in New York the following month.
Knowledge of the effect emerged when Lorenz discovered that a computer
simulation of the weather patterns often followed familiar patterns but
always with variations. James Gleick summarizes, "But the repetitions
were never quite exact. There was a pattern, with disturbances. An
orderly disorder."[^65]

“Chaos theory does not deny natural order; it denies static equilibrium,
and reaffirms Heraclitus' notion of flux...Both relativity and quantum
theory imply that the universe is an unbroken whole, and chaos theory
does not undermine such a worldview” writes the anarchist Peter
Marshall.[^66] Hakim Bey argues that chaos theory implies “reality
itself subsists in a state of ontological anarchy,” since it means
reality “has no 'ruler' and 'no laws'”.[^67]

# Panpsychism

Free will is a concept valued by many if not most anarchists as a
premise for the moral necessity of freedom; Malatesta wrote, "\[I\]f
will has no power, if it does not exist, if everything is necessary and
cannot happen in another way, then the ideas of freedom, of justice, of
responsibility, have no meaning, do not correspond to anything
real."[^68]

The anarchist David Graeber finds a basis for free will in the
philosophical notion of panspsychism, which argues that all matter has
at least some basic level of consciousness. As possible evidence for
panpsychism, he cites the self-organization and spontaneity of the
electromagnetic field, snowflakes, and subatomic particles:

> Or more to the point, why are we perfectly willing to ascribe agency
> to a strand of DNA (however “metaphorically”), but consider it absurd
> to do the same with an electron, a snowflake, or a coherent
> electromagnetic field? The answer, it seems, is because it’s pretty
> much impossible to ascribe self-interest to a snowflake. If we have
> convinced ourselves that rational explanation of action can consist
> only of treating action as if there were some sort of self-serving
> calculation behind it, then by that definition, on all these levels,
> rational explanations can’t be found. Unlike a DNA molecule, which we
> can at least pretend is pursuing some gangster-like project of
> ruthless self-aggrandizement, an electron simply does not have a
> material interest to pursue, not even survival. It is in no sense
> competing with other electrons. If an electron is acting freely—if it,
> as Richard Feynman is supposed to have said, “does anything it
> likes”—it can only be acting freely as an end in itself. Which would
> mean that at the very foundations of physical reality, we encounter
> freedom for its own sake—which also means we encounter the most
> rudimentary form of play.[^69]

# *The Dispossessed*

Ursula Le Guin's science fiction novel *The Dispossessed* stars a
physicist named Shevek who lives on the anarchist planet
<a href="Anarres" class="wikilink" title="Anarres">Anarres</a>. Shevek
tries to combine the Theory of Sequency (which saw time as linear) and
the Theory of Simultaneity (which saw time as cyclical) into a general
theory called the Temporal Theory of Time. "Time goes in cycles, as well
as in a line," Shevek explains.[^70]
