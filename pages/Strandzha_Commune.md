## Decision-Making

According to one historian righting on the subject:

> "The question of state power was never raised, and no decrees were
> issued. The population of the liberated villages nominated and elected
> not mayors and presidents, but commissioners from among their own
> number. The commissions were to administer, not to rule. Never was
> there any talk of establishing any authorities, albeit new ones. It
> was only emphasized that the "commissions" would function under the
> control of the rebel forces. This was quite natural and also a matter
> of necessity, because decisive power was now in the hands of the
> people in arms, and its fate was in its own hands.[^1]

## Economy

labor force was composed of women, who worked in the farms as men became
guerilla fighters. This period saw a significant boost in the health of
people as they were able to eat more.[^2]

## Culture

The now free villagers held numerous feasts, dances and festivals to
celebrate the commune.[^3]

## Collapse

The commune was destroyed as it was stormed by thousands of Ottoman
soldiers.[^4]
