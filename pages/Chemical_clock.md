The chemical clock is a self-organizing chemical reaction studied by
Ilya Prigogine and colleagues in Brussels in the 1960s. In
far-from-equilibrium conditions, a mix of two kinds of molecules, say
"red" and "blue," will abruptly alternate between being all red and all
blue. This coordination suggests a high degree of self-organization
between the molecules.[^1]
