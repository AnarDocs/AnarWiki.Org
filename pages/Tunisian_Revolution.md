## Background

*Main Article:
<a href="Ali_Dictatorship" class="wikilink" title="Ali Dictatorship">Ali
Dictatorship</a>*

For 23 years, Tunisia had been under the dictatorship of Ben Ali, a
one-party state that not only restricted the media but also repressed
political opposition (notably backed by the
<a href="Timeline_of_US_Imperialism" class="wikilink" title="US">US</a>
and <a href="Francafrique" class="wikilink" title="France">France</a>).
Compounded with high unemployment, inflation, corruption and poor living
conditions it was a breeding ground for revolt. On the 17 of the
December, <a href="Mohamed_Bouazizi" class="wikilink"
title="Mohamed Bouazizi">Mohamed Bouazizi</a>, a street vendor who sold
fruit and vegetables who has been harassed repeatedly by city officials
ended up burning himself in public in front of the city headquarters
after his requests to take back his produce was denied, sparking the
revolution.

## Events

Following Bouazizi's self-burning, protests occurred in the city, and
protesters began to attack shop windows and cars, leading to police
attacking them. Tear gas was fired onto protesters and extra police
posted as protesters gathered outside the capital. Several other
protesters killed themselves and police shot several protesters, and
curfews were imposed. Violence exploded across the country, as trade
unions began to organise protest marches and protesters began to attack
police and set fire to tires. Hacking began of governments websites
began and Tunisia's lawyers went on strike, with teachers joining the
following day. Protsters set fire to buses and cars, leading to the
military being deployed.

On the 28th of December, Ben Ali fired several ministers and announced
the creation of 300,000 jobs. He accused the protesters of being
extremists, gang members and foreign mercenaries. Political prisoners
were released and all schools and universities were closed. On the 14th
of January the government was dissolved, the airport was closed, a state
of emergency declared and elections were called. Ben Ali later fled that
day to <a href="Malta" class="wikilink" title="Malta">Malta</a> under
<a href="Socialist_Libya" class="wikilink" title="Libyan">Libyan</a>
protection before fleeing to
<a href="Saudi_Arabia" class="wikilink" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi

<a href="France" class="wikilink" title="France">France</a>.

A temporary government was set up to organise elections and maintain law
and order. Looting continued and the main train station of Tunis (the
largest and capital city of Tunisia) was burnt. A prison director in
Mahdia freed about 1,000 inmates following a prison rebellion that left
5 people dead. Many other prisons also had jailbreaks or raids from
external groups to force prisoner releases, some suspected to be aided
by prison guards. Residents who were running out of necessary food
supplies had armed themselves and barricaded their homes, and in some
cases had formed armed neighborhood watches. The police, pro-Ali
militias and the state security service were vying for control and
several gunfights erupted between the groups.

The new government saw daily protests, leading to it quickly dissolving
itself. The next government announced that all prisoners would be freed,
all political parties legalised in six months and transparent and free
elections in six months. Police soon joined the protesters for increased
pay and the army firmly defended the revolution. The new government
fulfilled protester demands, and elections were held on the 23rd of
October, 2011.

## Results

The revolution resulted in several things, notably:

- The revolution triggered the wider (and much less successful)
  <a href="Arab_Spring" class="wikilink" title="Arab Spring">Arab
  Spring</a> and a <a href="Revolutions_of_2010_-_2015" class="wikilink"

  of protests, revolts and strikes across the world in 2011</a>.
- Creation of a liberal representative democracy in Tunisia.
- Massive expansion of

- Greater internet freedom, access to Tor and

- 4,000 refugees fleeing to

## Analysis

The Tunisian Revolution has been heavily analysed for it being the only
successful revolution of the Arab Spring (arguably alongside
<a href="Rojava_Revolution" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a>),
several factors for this success have been proposed, especially in
comparison to the <a href="Egyptian_Revolution_(2011)" class="wikilink"
title="failed revolution in Egypt">failed revolution in Egypt</a>.

- The military stayed out of politics.
- Tunisia lacked severe religious and ethnic tensions, with the
  religious right refusing to enact Sharia Law and accepting an equal
  rights amendment for women. Secularists did not attempt to restrict
  religious organisations.
- Tunisia had large and independent
