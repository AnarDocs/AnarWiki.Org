> In May 2003, as envoys of the eight leading world governments prepared
> for the “G8” summit in Evian, France, the anti-capitalist movement set
> up a series of connected villages to serve as a foundation for protest
> and an example of collective, anti-capitalist living; these took the
> name VAAAG (Village Alternatif, Anticapitalist et AntiGuerres). For
> the duration of the mobilization, thousands of people lived in these
> villages, organizing food, housing, childcare, debate forums, media,
> and legal services, and making decisions communally. The project was
> widely regarded as a success. The VAAAG also exhibited the dual form
> of organization suggested above. Specific “neighborhoods,” each with
> fewer than 200 people, organized around a community kitchen, while
> village-wide services — “inter-neighborhood collective spaces” such as
> the legal and medical space — were organized by those involved in
> providing those services.
