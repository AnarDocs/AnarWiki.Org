## History

### Origins

During the <a href="French_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, sociétés
révolutionnaire controlled municipal governments and established
alliances between neighboring cities, forming a federation of hundreds
of "municipalist republics" in south France known as
**communalism**.[^2]

<a href="Municipal_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="earliest forms of municipalism">earliest forms of

<a href="Federation_of_the_Socialist_Workers_of_France.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federation of the Socialist Workers of France">Federation of the
Socialist Workers of France</a> (a predecessor of the modern

of the municipality of
<a href="Commentry.md" class="wikilink" title="Commentry">Commentry</a>.[^4]
In subsequent municipal elections, socialist candidates and parties
increased the number of municipalities they controlled to 70 in 1892,
and then over 100 in 1896. Meanwhile, in
<a href="Italy.md" class="wikilink" title="Italy">Italy</a>, changes in
electoral laws enabled the

<a href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> promoted what he called
<a href="Murray_Bookchin#Municipalism_and_communalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian municipalism">libertarian municipalism</a> as the
political branch of social ecology, focusing on the development of
<a href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> within existing local
governance structures.[^6][^7]

### Current Status

Bookchin has been one of the influences on a movement known as "new
municipalism" in the twenty-first century, exemplified by
<a href="Barcelona_en_Comú.md" class="wikilink"
title="Barcelona en Comú">Barcelona en Comú</a>.[^8][^9][^10][^11]

## Organisation

This approach encourages municipalities to join in confederations to
collectively address larger regional issues, creating a network of
interconnected communities focused on cooperation and mutual aid. Rooted
in principles of direct democracy, decentralization, and
<a href="libertarian_communalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian communalism">libertarian communalism</a>, this system
is intended to serve as an alternative to centralized nation-states and
corporate capitalism.

Bookchin argues that citizenship was a virtue that had become denatured
by the dominance of late-stage capitalist nation states, and he viewed
municipalism - particularly focused on popular, directly democratic
assemblies as a form of municipal governance, as the key to reviving it:
"Be they large or small, the initial assemblies and the movement that
seeks to foster them in civic elections remain the only real school for
citizenship that we have. There is no civic 'curriculum' other than a
living and creative political realm that can give rise to people who
take management of public affairs seriously."[^12]

Bookchin contrasts this approach with past attempts to create a
stateless society, critiquing traditional anarchism for its focus on
non-political arenas like factories or cooperatives. In Bookchin's view,
the municipality represents the ideal setting for building a true public
sphere, revitalizing active citizenship, and strengthening community
bonds.[^13]

## Economics

### Municipalization as a foundation for an ecological society

Bookchin posits that neither privatization nor nationalization can
effectively pave the way toward an ecological society. He asserts that
both models are deeply embedded in structures of domination, failing to
address the root causes of environmental crises. In contrast, Bookchin
advocates for municipalization as a core principle in his libertarian
municipalist framework.

### Critique of privatization and nationalization

Bookchin critiques private property as a central driver of both social
and ecological harm, associating it with exploitation, domination, and
the prioritization of profit over community and environmental
well-being. According to Bookchin, systems based on private ownership
promote competition and individualism, which he argues are incompatible
with the cooperation and solidarity needed to build a fair and
sustainable society.

Nationalization, often positioned as a remedy to capitalism's excesses,
is also seen by Bookchin as inadequate. He contends that nationalization
typically shifts control from private companies to centralized
bureaucratic entities, merely replacing one form of dominance with
another. In this state-centered model, the apparatus of the state,
rather than the market, assumes authority over economic activities. This
can lead to what Bookchin describes as a "privatized economy in a
collectivized form," where workers remain detached from their labor and
ecological exploitation persists.[^14]

## Influence on Democratic Confederalism

Libertarian municipalism has significantly influenced the development of
<a href="Democratic_Confederalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Democratic Confederalism">Democratic Confederalism</a>,
particularly through the work of
<a href="Abdullah_Öcalan.md" class="wikilink"
title="Abdullah Öcalan">Abdullah Öcalan</a> and its implementation in
<a href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> (Syrian
Kurdistan). Öcalan, while imprisoned, studied Bookchin's writings
extensively and adapted libertarian municipalist principles to create a
political framework that emphasizes local democratic assemblies, gender
equality, and ecological sustainability. This influence represents a
practical application of Bookchin's theoretical framework in a
real-world revolutionary context, demonstrating how libertarian
municipalist ideas can be adapted to different cultural and political
contexts while maintaining core principles of direct democracy and
decentralized governance.

## Criticism

Critics of libertarian municipalism argue that it may be difficult to
implement in practice, particularly in large urban areas where direct
democracy becomes unwieldy. Others contend that the system may be
vulnerable to domination by more organized or vocal groups within
communities. Additionally, some argue that the focus on municipal-level
organization may not adequately address global challenges that require
coordinated action beyond local boundaries.
