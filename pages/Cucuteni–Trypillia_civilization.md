# Cucuteni–Trypillia Civilization

From about 5500 to 2750 BCE,[^1] in what is now Moldova, Romania and
Ukraine, the Cucuteni–Trypillian civilisation had a population of more
than one million people.[^2] For at least its earliest period, until
around 4440 BCE, Cucuteni–Trypillian society appears to have been highly
egalitarian, peaceful, and ecologically sustainable — one of the most
striking examples of large-scale non-hierarchical organisation in the
prehistoric record.

The culture extended from the Carpathian Mountains to the Dniester and
Dnieper regions, covering an area of roughly 350,000 km², with
settlements ranging from small villages to vast sites housing tens of
thousands of people. During its middle phase (c. 4100–3500 BCE), it
produced some of the largest settlements in Eurasia, and possibly the
world, at that time. The Romanian sites are called Cucuteni and the
Ukrainian sites Trypillia, but they form a single unified culture.[^3]

# Overview

Anarchists and anti-authoritarian researchers have been drawn to the
Cucuteni–Trypillian civilisation because it demonstrates that large,
complex, and technologically sophisticated societies can organise
themselves without centralised political authority, hereditary elites,
or institutionalised violence. At its peak it was among the most
technologically advanced societies in the world, developing advanced
ceramics, agriculture, metallurgy, and possibly the earliest wheeled
vehicles — all without the apparatus of the state.

A common settlement pattern places equally-sized houses arranged in
concentric circles around an open central area, likely used for popular
assemblies and communal ceremonies. While the houses are uniform on the
outside, their interiors show varied and distinctive decoration,
suggesting strong individual expression within a framework of material
equality. Neighbourhoods within these settlements differ enough in their
arrangements that archaeologists believe planning was bottom-up rather
than directed from above.[^4] The largest known site, Taljanky,
contained around 1,000 houses and covered 300 hectares.[^5]

Scholars from the
<a href="Collaborative_Research_Centre_1266" class="wikilink"
title="Collaborative Research Centre 1266">Collaborative Research Centre
1266</a> at Kiel University found that the mega-sites were associated
with reduced social inequality, and that it was only after several
generations that increased social differentiation re-emerged — possibly
explaining the subsequent abandonment of these sites. Their research
suggests that large aggregations of population can develop mechanisms to
actively suppress inequality, and that social complexity need not
produce greater stratification.

# History

## Origins

The roots of Cucuteni–Trypillian culture lie in the Starčevo–Körös–Criș
and Vinča cultures of the sixth and fifth millennia BCE, with additional
influence from the Bug–Dniester culture. Over the course of the fifth
millennium BCE the culture expanded from its homeland in the Prut–Siret
region along the eastern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains,
eventually reaching the basins of the Dnieper and Southern Bug rivers in
central Ukraine. Most early settlements were located near rivers, with
dwellings initially taking the form of pit-houses alongside an
increasing number of above-ground clay structures.

R. Brian Ferguson notes that during the society's early period, from
5500 to 4440 BCE, "No indications of war are reported" and society was
egalitarian. Weapons are rare but not unknown across all periods,
implying the culture was relatively peaceful throughout most of its
existence.

## Middle Period (c. 4100–3500 BCE)

The middle period saw the culture spread from eastern Transylvania to
the Dnieper River, with population growing considerably and settlements
established across plateaus and river banks. This is the era of the
mega-sites — settlements that rivalled or exceeded the city-states of
Sumer in size, predating them by more than half a millennium. Taljanky,
in Uman Raion, Ukraine, covered 335 hectares with a population estimated
at up to 15,000 people.

Despite this scale, there is no evidence of labour specialisation. Every
household was likely self-sufficient, with extended family members
working fields, hunting, gathering clay, and fishing. Archaeological
analysis of the mega-sites shows that households maintained broadly
equal access to resources, with no evidence of a ruling class,
priesthood, or military elite accumulating disproportionate wealth.

## Late Period and Decline (c. 3500–2750 BCE)

After 4440 BCE, Cucuteni–Trypillian culture "saw a shift to internal
social hierarchy," and after 3320 BCE "there were stone ramparts and
population replacements."[^6] The culture eventually gave way to the
Corded Ware/Battle-Axe culture, which spread across northern Europe,
bringing with it a well-defined military elite.

There is ongoing debate about the precise causes of the culture's end.
Some scholars, following <a href="Marija_Gimbutas" class="wikilink"
title="Marija Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a>, argue for invasion by
Kurgan (Yamnaya) peoples from the Pontic–Caspian steppe, pointing to
distinct cultural differences between the egalitarian
Cucuteni–Trypillian world and the patriarchal, warlike Kurgan culture.
Others point to climatic change beginning around 3200 BCE, when Europe's
climate became markedly colder and drier, potentially collapsing the
agricultural base of the mega-sites. A third view emphasises gradual
cultural transformation and intermarriage rather than violent conquest,
supported by genetic evidence showing steppe ancestry entering the
Trypillian gene pool as early as 3500 BCE. Archaeological evidence of
refugees using caves, islands and hilltops — abandoning 600–700
settlements in the process — suggests the end was traumatic regardless
of its cause.

# Culture

Household pottery and figurines frequently portray women's bodies.[^7]
Gimbutas interpreted the Cucuteni–Trypillian world as part of a
gender-egalitarian, goddess-worshipping "Old Europe" — a broad Neolithic
civilisation centred on female imagery and communal life, before being
disrupted by patriarchal Indo-European peoples from the steppes.[^8]

The circular arrangement of houses places no one at the head and leaves
space in the centre for communal activity. Chris Knight has likened it
to the contemporary and relatively egalitarian Canela villages of
Brazil, whose inhabitants also arrange their houses in a circle.[^9] The
setup is also reminiscent of the Ju/'hoan
(<a href="San" class="wikilink" title="San">San</a>) village layout
described by Richard Lee.[^10]

Before leaving a village or city, Trypillians would burn their
houses.[^11] Some scholars interpret this as evidence that settlements
were understood as living entities with their own life cycles — each
house, along with its contents, sharing in a symbolic circle of birth
and death. Settlements were often rebuilt on exactly the same footprint,
with one Romanian site, Poduri, revealing thirteen successive habitation
levels constructed atop one another.

Ukrainian minimalist fashion designer Svitlana Bevza, who has studied
Cucuteni–Trypillian culture, observed: "The most precious part of
Trypillian ceramic culture is cherishing the woman. And the symbolism of
the woman — like a goddess, like a symbol of fertile land, like a symbol
of birth — they cherished it a lot."[^12]

# Organisation

Archaeological evidence consistently points to a society without a
recognisable state apparatus. There is no evidence of a political elite,
no monumental architecture dedicated to rulers or gods in the manner of
later civilisations, no warrior burials of the kind that mark
hierarchical Bronze Age societies, and no obvious division of labour
beyond what households managed themselves. Each household was largely
self-sufficient.

The concentric circular layout of settlements, with no central building
elevated above others in scale or prominence (except in some cases a
communal structure identified as a sanctuary), suggests decision-making
power resided with the community as a whole. Archaeologists believe the
varied but consistent neighbourhood arrangements indicate bottom-up
planning — communities negotiating space and structure among themselves
rather than following directives from above.[^13]

# Economy

Residents combined small-scale farming and foraging, producing a varied
diet including wheat, barley and pulses, apples, pears, cherries, sloes,
acorns, hazelnuts and apricots, meat from wild red deer, roe deer and
wild boar,[^14] and domesticated cattle.[^15]

Graeber and Wengrow describe their broader economic arrangements:

> As well as managing orchards, gardens, livestock and woodlands, the
> inhabitants of these cities imported salt in bulk from springs in the
> eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea littoral. Flint extraction by
> the ton took place in the Dniestr valley, furnishing material for
> tools. A household potting industry flourished, its products
> considered among the finest ceramics of the prehistoric world; and
> regular supplies of copper flowed in from the Balkans.[^16]

The diet in the largest mega-sites was almost entirely plant-based, with
meat making up only around 10% of what people ate. This was not due to
scarcity — scientists from Kiel University found that cattle were
intensively managed to provide manure for growing pulses, suggesting a
deliberate and sophisticated agricultural strategy rather than simple
subsistence.

Each household was mostly self-sufficient and there was very little need
for trade. Certain mineral resources — particularly flint, salt, and
later copper — did form the basis of a rudimentary trade network that
grew more complex toward the culture's later period, as attested by an
increasing number of artefacts from other cultures found at Trypillian
sites.

# Environment

The ecological impact of Cucuteni–Trypillian cities is surprisingly
light given their size, leading Graeber and Wengrow to speculate that
residents "consciously managed their ecosystem to avoid large-scale
deforestation."[^17] This stands in contrast to many later urban
civilisations, where city growth tends to correlate with environmental
degradation.

Svitlana Bevza reflects: "There are a lot of things that we have to
learn from the ancient people, from Trypillian people: their attitude to
life and nature, because they understood that they depend on the
nature."[^18]
