From about 5500 to 2750 BCE[^1] in what's now Moldova, Romania and
Ukraine, the Cucuteni-Trypillian civilization had a population of more
than 1 million people.[^2] For at least the earliest period, until
around 4440 BCE, Cucuteni-Trypillian society appears to have been highly
egalitarian, peaceful, and ecologically sustainable.

A common pattern is for equally-sized houses to be arranged in
concentric circles around an open area that might have been used for
popular assemblies and ceremonies. Although houses are the same size and
look the same on the outside, the insides have extremely varied
decorations suggesting individuality and playfulness. Moreover, the
neighborhoods, while sharing circular arrangements, have different
enough arrangements that archeologists believe the planning must have
been from the bottom up. The largest site in Taljanky which has 1000
houses and covers 300 hectares.[^3]

The Romanian sites are called Cucuteni and the sites in the former
Soviet Union are called Trypilla. However, they form a unified
culture.[^4]

R. Brian Ferguson notes that during the society's early period, from
5500 to 4440 BCE, "No indications of war are reported" and society was
egalitarian. But after 4440, Cucuteni-Trypilla culture "saw a shift to
internal social hierarchy" and after 3320 BCE, "there were stone
ramparts and population replacements. Cucuteni-Tripolye gave way to the
Corded Ware/Battle-Ax culture that spread - alrthough with surprisingly
few signs of actual war - across northern Europe, and passed into the
Copper Age, with its well-defined military elite."[^5]

# Culture

Household pottery and figurines frequently portray women's bodies.[^6]
Gimbutas sees Cucuteni–Trypillia culture as part of a
gender-egalitarian, goddess-worshiping "Old Europe".[^7]

The circular arrangement of houses puts no one at the head and which
leaves space in the middle for communal activity. Chris Knight likens it
to a contemporary and relatively egalitarian village of Canela villagers
in Brazil who also arrange their houses in a circle.[^8] Before leaving
a village or city, Trypillians would burn their houses.[^9] The setup is
also reminiscent of the Ju/'hoan/!Kung
(<a href="San.md" class="wikilink" title="San">San</a>) village.[^10]

Ukrainian minimalist fashion designer Svitlana Bevza has studied
Cucuteni-Trippilian culture and based designs on it. She says, "The most
precious part of Trypillian ceramic culture is cherishing the woman. And
the symbolism of the woman - like a goddess, like a symbol of fertile
land, like a symbol of birth - they cherished it a lot."[^11]

# Economy

Residents combined small-scale farming and foraging, producing a varied
diet including "wheat, barley and pulses," "apples, pears, cherries,
sloes, acorns, hazelnuts and apricots," and meat from wild "red deer,
roe deer and wild boar"[^12] and domesticated cattle.[^13]

Graeber and Wengrow elaborate on their economy:

> As well as managing orchards, gardens, livestock and woodlands, the
> inhabitants of these cities imported salt in bulk from springs in the
> eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea littoral. Flint extraction by
> the ton took place in the Dniestr valley, furnishing material for
> tools. A household potting industry flourished, its products
> considered among the finest ceramics of the prehistoric world; and
> regular supplies of copper flowed in from the Balkans.[^14]

# Environment

The ecological impact of Cucuteni-Trypillia cities is surprisingly
light, leading Graeber and Wengrow to speculate that residents
"consciously managed their ecosystem to avoid large-scale
deforestation."[^15]

According to Svitlana Bevza, "There are a lot of things that we have to
learn from the ancient people, from Trypillian people: their attitude to
life and nature, because they understood that they depend on the
nature."[^16]
