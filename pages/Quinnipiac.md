“Quinnipiac,” meaning “Long Water Land” refers to one part of the land
of "Quiripi" belonging to an Algonquian-speaking indigenous people who
variously call themselves the Quinnipiac, Quiripi, and Renapi.
Linguistic research suggests they once lived in all of Connecticut and
parts of eastern New York and Long Island.[^1] When English settlers
arrived in 1638, they documented Quinnipiac residency in what are now
the Connecticut towns of New Haven, North Haven, Guilford, and
Branford.[^2]

Archaeologists have found human artifacts in New Haven that date back to
about 6000 BCE. Dena Dincauze dates the rise of sachems in Quinnipiac
societies to the “Late Woodland period” of 1000-1500 CE, the same times
as the adoption of maize agriculture.[^3]

Information about the present-day Algonuian Confederacy of the
Quinnipiac Tribal Council can be found on their website.[^4]

# Culture

Each Quinnipiac nuclear family traditionally lived in a wigwam,
typically about eight feet high and sixteen feet long. Sometimes the
family shared the house with other relatives. Women did most of the
farming, child-raising, and meal preparation. Divorce was easy, and
women commonly left abusive husbands. From a young age, children were
encouraged to be independent and to assist the elderly. Men did most of
the hunting and fishing.[^5]

# Decisions

As described in a 2007 essay by the current Quinnipiac Grand Sachem Iron
Thunderhorse, the nation's traditional government consisted of local
sachemdoms, who federated under a Grand Sachem and belonged to very
large federations of other Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking
peoples.[^6] The Grand Sachem, according to Thunderhorse, “was
responsible for conducting diplomatic relations, welcoming runners (news
carriers), merchants, etc.”[^7] The Grand Sachem collected a tribute
from the local sachems' villages.

At the village level, a Long House Chief or *sachem* led a council of
stump chiefs or *Sagamore/Sagamaugh*. The Long House Chief inherited his
or her position, while the stump chiefs did not.[^8] The stump chiefs
were elderly and well-respected community members.[^9] According to
Thunderhorse, their duties included “operating the outlying summer
fishing camps, wampum bead processing, collecting and drying foods,
harvesting commodities...”[^10]

“It was not uncommon...for sachems in New England to be women,”
anthropologist John Menta observes, citing the female Quinnipiac sachems
Shaumpishuh and Sjambisqia.[^11]

By some accounts, the sachems and their councils had little or no
coercive authority over their villages. Anthropologist Robert Grumet
claims that the sachem's “power depended on the power of persuasion
rather than the persuasion of power.”[^12] If people did not agree with
their sachem, they would either disobey or leave to join another
sachemdom. By necessity, then, the sachems appear to have followed the
expressed consensus of the band for all important decisions.

Menta elaborates, “Important decisions were made by the sachem and his
or her council based on the general consensus of the band. Families,
factions or individuals who disagreed with the consensus were free to
relocate and join another native community.”[^13] On minor decisions,
the sachem usually went along with the view of the council.[^14]

Once in 1645, Quinnipiacs' dogs killed some pigs belonging to English
settlers, and the settlers convinced the sachem Momauguin to order all
of his band's dogs to be killed. The vast majority of the band's
dog-owners refused to kill their dogs, and Momauguin explained the New
Haven's Town Marshall that he had not pressed the issue since he feared
other tribe members might poison him.[^15]

There is not a consensus over the degree of government that the
Quinnipiac traditionally had. By Menta's account, “the Quinnipiac lacked
a strong, centralized form of government.”[^16] However, a study of the
southern New England Indians by Kathleen Bragdon describes a more
hierarchical society as typical of the region, with sachems getting
wealthy by taxing subjects, and a class of people born into permanent
slavery.[^17] Bragdon's analysis, while not specifically about the
Quinnipiac, may call into question aspects of Menta's account of a
relatively society. Thunderhorse communicated with both Menta and
Bragdon and has commented favorably on the work of both scholars.[^18]
The current constitution of the Algonquian Confederacy of the Quinnipiac
Tribal Council describes the Grand Sachem as the nation's “ultimate
sovereign.”[^19]

# Economy

According to reports of settlers such as Roger Williams, the Indians of
New England communally owned land and did not have individually-owned
private property. Williams wrote, “the *Natives* are very exact and
punctuall in the bounds of their Lands, belonging to this or that Prince
or People.”[^20] Each village appears to have had a gift economy, and
even trades between villages “were articulated in the language of
gift-giving.”[^21]

The Quinnipiac farmed, hunted, and fished for food. Starting in 1622,
they traded wampum (beads made from clam shells) with the Dutch and then
other settlers in exchange for fur.[^22]

# Environment

Algonquian cosmologies viewed all things as alive and intrinsically
valuable. Menta summarizes, “all things—animals, trees, rocks and
natural phenomena—were living beings who possessed supernatural
powers.”[^23]

Indians' activities affected their environment but not always for the
worse. For example, Southern New England's Indians set fire to selected
forests once or twice a year to clear land underbrush. These burnings
allowed more sunlight to reach the ground, killed certain pests and
plant diseases, and increased the rate that the soil recycled nutrients.
The resulting landscape, resembling the edges of forests, were good
habitat for strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, elk, deer, beaver,
porcupine, turkey, quail, wolves, foxes, eagles, hawks, and lynxes.
Environmental historian William Cronon remarks, “Indian burning promoted
the increase of exactly those species whose abundance so impressed
English colonists.”[^24]

# Neighboring Societies

Thunderhorse writes that the Quinnipiac nation traditionally affiliated
with the Wappinger Confederacy, which belonged to an even broader
Dawnland Confederacy that “included Algonquian and Iroquoian speaking
peoples of the \[northeast\] Woodlands who met once a year at a Grand
Central Fire. Wampum belts, known as Covenant Chain belts, and strings
of wampum were carried by the Iroquoian Pine Tree Chiefs, Algonquian
Long House Chiefs and Stump Chiefs, who, with wise powwamanitompoag
(shamans), met at these large assemblages.”[^25] By contrast, Menta
descries the Wappinger Confederacy as a “myth” and contends that the
Quinnipiacs “were not members of a confederacy or effective military
alliance.”[^26]

On 24 November 1638, English settlers signed the “Momauguin Treaty” with
the Quinnipiac sachem Momauguin. Allegedly, this treaty ceded almost all
Quinnipiac lands to the English in return for military protection from
other Indians. However, John Menta comments:

> That the Quinnipiac sachems perceived the terms of the treaty in the
> same light as the English did is doubtful. Though the colonists viewed
> the treaty as essentially a deed of purchase to the territory, the
> Indians interpreted it more as an agreement for joint occupation of
> the land.[^27]

The Quinnipiac refer to the English settlers' long campaign of
dispossessing and converting Indians as a “Trail of Heartaches.”[^28]
