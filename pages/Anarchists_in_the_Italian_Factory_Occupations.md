> After the end of the First World War there was a massive
> radicalisation across Europe and the world. Union membership exploded,
> with strikes, demonstrations and agitation reaching massive levels.
> This was partly due to the war, partly to the apparent success of the
> Russian Revolution. This enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution even
> reached Individualist Anarchists like Joseph Labadie, who like many
> other anti-capitalists, saw *"the red in the east \[giving\] hope of a
> brighter day"* and the Bolsheviks as making *"laudable efforts to at
> least try some way out of the hell of industrial slavery."* \[quoted
> by Carlotta R. Anderson, **All-American Anarchist** p. 225 and p.
> 241\]
>
> Across Europe, anarchist ideas became more popular and
> anarcho-syndicalist unions grew in size. For example, in Britain, the
> ferment produced the shop stewards' movement and the strikes on
> Clydeside; Germany saw the rise of IWW inspired industrial unionism
> and a libertarian form of Marxism called "Council Communism"; Spain
> saw a massive growth in the anarcho-syndicalist CNT. In addition, it
> also, unfortunately, saw the rise and growth of both social democratic
> and communist parties. Italy was no exception.
>
> In Turin, a new rank-and-file movement was developing. This movement
> was based around the *"internal commissions"* (elected ad hoc
> grievance committees). These new organisations were based directly on
> the group of people who worked together in a particular work shop,
> with a mandated and recallable shop steward elected for each group of
> 15 to 20 or so workers. The assembly of all the shop stewards in a
> given plant then elected the "internal commission" for that facility,
> which was directly and constantly responsible to the body of shop
> stewards, which was called the *"factory council."*
>
> Between November 1918 and March 1919, the internal commissions had
> become a national issue within the trade union movement. On February
> 20, 1919, the Italian Federation of Metal Workers (FIOM) won a
> contract providing for the election of "internal commissions" in the
> factories. The workers subsequently tried to transform these organs of
> workers' representation into factory councils with a managerial
> function. By May Day 1919, the internal commissions *"were becoming
> the dominant force within the metalworking industry and the unions
> were in danger of becoming marginal administrative units. Behind these
> alarming developments, in the eyes of reformists, lay the
> libertarians."* \[Carl Levy, **Gramsci and the Anarchists**, p. 135\]
> By November 1919 the internal commissions of Turin were transformed
> into factory councils.
>
> The movement in Turin is usually associated with the weekly **L'Ordine
> Nuovo** (The New Order), which first appeared on May 1, 1919. As
> Daniel Guerin summarises, it was *"edited by a left socialist, Antonio
> Gramsci, assisted by a professor of philosophy at Turin University
> with anarchist ideas, writing under the pseudonym of Carlo Petri, and
> also of a whole nucleus of Turin libertarians. In the factories, the
> Ordine Nuovo group was supported by a number of people, especially the
> anarcho-syndicalist militants of the metal trades, Pietro Ferrero and
> Maurizio Garino. The manifesto of Ordine Nuovo was signed by
> socialists and libertarians together, agreeing to regard the factory
> councils as 'organs suited to future communist management of both the
> individual factory and the whole society.'"* \[**Anarchism**, p. 109\]
>
> The developments in Turin should not be taken in isolation. All across
> Italy, workers and peasants were taking action. In late February 1920,
> a rash of factory occupations broke out in Liguria, Piedmont and
> Naples. In Liguria, the workers occupied the metal and shipbuilding
> plants in Sestri Ponente, Cornigliano and Campi after a breakdown of
> pay talks. For up to four days, under syndicalist leadership, they ran
> the plants through factory councils.
>
> During this period the Italian Syndicalist Union (USI) grew in size to
> around 800 000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist
> Union (UAI) with its 20 000 members and daily paper (**Umanita Nova**)
> grew correspondingly. As the Welsh Marxist historian Gwyn A. Williams
> points out *"Anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists were the most
> consistently and totally revolutionary group on the left . . . the
> most obvious feature of the history of syndicalism and anarchism in
> 1919-20: rapid and virtually continuous growth . . . The syndicalists
> above all captured militant working-class opinion which the socialist
> movement was utterly failing to capture."* \[**Proletarian Order**,
> pp. 194-195\] In Turin, libertarians *"worked within FIOM"* and had
> been *"heavily involved in the **Ordine Nuovo** campaign from the
> beginning."* \[**Op. Cit.**, p. 195\] Unsurprisingly, **Ordone Nuovo**
> was denounced as "syndicalist" by other socialists.
>
> It was the anarchists and syndicalists who first raised the idea of
> occupying workplaces. Malatesta was discussing this idea in **Umanita
> Nova** in March, 1920. In his words, *"General strikes of protest no
> longer upset anyone . . . One must seek something else. We put forward
> an idea: take-over of factories. . . the method certainly has a
> future, because it corresponds to the ultimate ends of the workers'
> movement and constitutes an exercise preparing one for the ultimate
> act of expropriation."* \[**Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas**, p.
> 134\] In the same month, during *"a strong syndicalist campaign to
> establish councils in Mila, Armando Borghi \[anarchist secretary of
> the USI\] called for mass factory occupations. In Turin, the
> re-election of workshop commissars was just ending in a two-week orgy
> of passionate discussion and workers caught the fever. \[Factory
> Council\] Commissars began to call for occupations."* Indeed, *"the
> council movement outside Turin was essentially anarcho-syndicalist."*
> Unsurprisingly, the secretary of the syndicalist metal-workers *"urged
> support for the Turin councils because they represented
> anti-bureaucratic direct action, aimed at control of the factory and
> could be the first cells of syndicalist industrial unions . . . The
> syndicalist congress voted to support the councils. . . . Malatesta .
> . . supported them as a form of direct action guaranteed to generate
> rebelliousness . . . **Umanita Nova** and **Guerra di Classe** \[paper
> of the USI\] became almost as committed to the councils as **L'Ordine
> Nuovo** and the Turin edition of **Avanti**."* \[Williams, **Op.
