# Platformism

**Platformism** is an
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
organizational theory that aims to create a tightly coordinated
anarchist federation. Its main features include a common tactical line,
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">"federalism</a>,
a unified political policy and a commitment to collective
responsibility.

First developed by
"<a   href="Peter_Arshinov.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Arshinov">"Peter
Arshinov</a> in response to the perceived disorganization of the Russian
anarchist movement, platformism proposes that a "general union of
anarchists" be established to agitate, educate and organize the
"<a   href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">"working
classes</a>. It advocates working within existing mass organizations,
such as
"<a   href="trade_unions.md" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">"trade
unions</a>, in order to transform them into vehicles for a

## Origins

### Organizational Precursors

The roots of platformism go back as far as the organizational principles
of "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a>,[^1] particularly in his
theory of "organisational dualism". Bakunin proposed that anarchists
form their own revolutionary organisations that would encourage and
agitate workers to rebel against the state and capitalism, and once a
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a> had replaced the state
with a federation of "<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">"voluntary associations</a>, it would then
further agitate against any attempted reconstitution of the state by
political parties.[^2]

The Platform's most direct predecessor was the *Draft Declaration of the
Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine*, adopted in 1919 by the
Military Revolutionary Council of the
"<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">"Makhnovshchina</a>. The *Draft Declaration*
called for a "Third Revolution" against the Bolshevik government, in
order to establish a regime of
"<a   href="free_soviets.md" class="wikilink" title="free soviets">"free
soviets</a>.[^3] It centered the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine
as the nucleus of this revolution, where the organization's entire
membership would carry out the decision-making process.[^4] In 1921, the
Makhnovists published another *Declaration* that proclaimed a
"<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a> in the form of an anarchist-led trade union system, for
which
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">"Nestor
Makhno</a> himself was accused of Bonapartism.[^5]

During this period, the Nabat Confederation of Anarchist Organizations,
which had originally been established as a loose-knit organization,
developed into a tightly organized structure with a unified policy and
an executive committee, in what a member would later describe as a
precursor to platformism.[^6]

### The Platform Document

After their flight into exile following defeat in the Russian
Revolution, Russian and Ukrainian anarchists began to call for the
reorganization of the anarchist movement, considering that chronic
disorganization had led to their defeat during the Revolution.[^7] Among
the anarcho-communists,
"<a   href="Peter_Arshinov.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Arshinov">"Peter
Arshinov</a> was the most vocal advocate of reorganization.[^8]

On 20 June 1926, the *Organizational Platform of the General Union of
Anarchists (Draft)* was published in *Delo Truda*, with an introduction
penned by Arshinov.[^9] Considering the goal of anarchism to be a
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a> that would create a
"<a   href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless">"stateless</a> and classless society, the *Platform*
proposed the establishment of a General Union of Anarchists to educate
the
"<a   href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">"working
class</a> and raise class consciousness.[^10] This General Union was to
be organised according to the principles of theoretical unity, tactical
unity and collective responsibility,[^11] and would be governed by an
executive committee that coordinated collective action and political
policy.[^12]

### Initial Debates

The *Platform* was first presented at a meeting of the *Delo Truda*
group, with attendees also including Bulgarian, Chinese, French and
Italian anarchists. At the meeting, Arshinov introduced the document as
a way forward for the international anarchist movement to "marshal its
forces".[^13] Although supported by
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">"Nestor
Makhno</a>, Arshinov's *Platform* was opposed by most prominent
anarchists at the time.[^14] French anarchists in attendance, led by
"<a   href="Sebastien_Faure.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sebastien Faure">"Sebastien Faure</a>, criticised it as
Russocentric, considering it unapplicable to the material conditions in
France.[^15] In the years that followed, Faure's *Anarchist Synthesis*,
which rejected platformism in favor of a more loose-knit organization,
contributed to dividing the anarchist movement into "synthesists" and
"platformists".[^16]

The Platform's harshest critics included
"<a   href="Volin.md" class="wikilink" title="Volin">"Volin</a>, Senya Fleshin
and Mollie Steimer,[^17] who denounced the *Platform* as an attempt to
create an anarchist "<a   href="political_party.md" class="wikilink"
title="political party">"political party</a>,[^18] which they feared
would inevitably result in the formation of a police state.[^19]
Arshinov responded by claiming his *Platform* actually abided by
anarchist principles, as it consciously avoided coercion and preserved
decentralization.[^20] The debate also took a more personal turn as
Makhno and Arshinov attacked Volin, which attracted denunciations from
other critics of the *Platform*,[^21] including
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">"Alexander Berkman</a>, who denounced Makhno as
a militarist and Arshinov as a Bolshevik.[^22]

After years of defending the ideas of Platformism, in the early 1930s,
Arshinov joined the Communist Party and defected to the
"<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">"Soviet
Union</a>,[^23] where he would disappear during the Great Purge.[^24]
Nestor Makhno himself died in 1934, leaving the *Platform* without any
prominent defenders.[^25] Nevertheless, both the opponents and remaining
supporters of the *Platform* managed to reconcile at Makhno's
funeral.[^26] Volin himself took up the publication of Makhno's memoirs,
which were published in the years after his death.[^27]

## Tendencies

### Spanish Civil War Developments

During the "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">"Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>, a
number of revolutionary anarchist hard-liners formed the
"<a   href="Friends_of_Durruti_Group.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friends of Durruti Group">"Friends of Durruti Group</a> in
opposition to the state's militarisation of the confederal
militias.[^28] After the Revolution was suppressed, the group published
*Towards a Fresh Revolution*, which called for a revolutionary council
to reform the militias and bring the economy back under the control of
the CNT, which would effectively have dissolved the government of
Spain.[^29] In the wake of the 1944 Bulgarian coup d'état, the
Federation of Anarchist Communists of Bulgaria (FAKB) issued its own
*Platform*, which argued for a specifically anarcho-communist
federation, coordinated by a central secretariat, which would
participate in trade unions and prepare for a social revolution.[^30]

### Post-War European Platformism

In 1953, the French anarchist
"<a   href="Georges_Fontenis.md" class="wikilink"
title="Georges Fontenis">"Georges Fontenis</a> published his *Manifesto
of Libertarian Communism*, which attacked the prevailing synthesist
orientation of the French anarchist movement, becoming the founding
document for the Libertarian Communist Federation (FCL).[^31] Drawing
from aspects of the *Platform*, Fontenis' *Manifesto* called for an
anarchist revolutionary vanguard to work within existing mass
organizations in order to develop a mass movement, with the eventual aim
of dissolving itself into the movement and achieving a social
revolution.[^32] In the years that followed, the FCL united together
with the North African Libertarian Movement (MLNA) to establish the
Libertarian Communist International (ICL), but their suppression by the
French state forced the organization's dissolution in 1957.[^33]

Platformism was revived in France during the events of the May 1968
movement, when the Revolutionary Anarchist Organization (ORA) was
founded, although it would remain the minority tendency within the wider
anarchist movement.[^34] The formation of the ORA accelerated the
establishment of other anarchist federations throughout Europe, such as
the "<a   href="Anarchist_Federation_(Britain).md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist Federation">"Anarchist Federation</a> (AF) in Britain
and the Federation of Anarchist Communists (FdCA) in Italy, while the
ORA itself would eventually be succeeded by the Libertarian Communist
Union (UCL).[^35]

### Especifismo

**Especifismo** (from Portuguese/Spanish, meaning "Specifism") was first
developed in 1972 by the Uruguayan Anarchist Federation (FAU), with the
publication of its text *Huerta Grande*, which proposed the creation of
a unified political policy directly applicable to the material
conditions in Uruguay.[^36] The collapse of the ruling right-wing
dictatorships towards the end of the Cold War resulted in the emergence
of many other *especifista* groups throughout Latin America, in a
process spearheaded by the FAU.[^37] In 2003, the Anarkismo.net website
was established by an international network of anarcho-communist
organizations, including both Latin American *especifistas* and European
platformists, which publishes news and analysis in a variety of
different languages.[^38]

## Criticism

The main criticisms of platformism have centered on concerns that it
represents a departure from traditional anarchist principles of
decentralization and autonomy. Critics have argued that the creation of
executive committees and unified political lines could lead to
authoritarianism within anarchist organizations.

The most prominent early critics - Volin, Senya Fleshin, and Mollie
Steimer - feared that platformism would create an anarchist political
party that could devolve into a police state.
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">"Alexander Berkman</a> and others worried about
the hierarchical implications of the organizational structure proposed
in the Platform.

The synthesis anarchism promoted by
"<a   href="Sebastien_Faure.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sebastien Faure">"Sebastien Faure</a> emerged as a direct
counter-proposal to platformism, advocating for a looser federation that
could accommodate diverse anarchist tendencies without the rigid
organizational structure proposed by Arshinov and Makhno.
