# Workers' Self-Management

## Overview

**Workers' self-management** — also referred to as **workers' control**,
**labour management**, and **autogestión** — describes forms of
workplace and economic organisation in which the workers themselves
collectively manage their enterprises, without a separate class of
owners or managers holding authority over them. Self-management is a
defining feature of anarchist and libertarian socialist economic
thought, and has been realised in practice across a range of historical
and contemporary contexts, from the collectivised industries of
revolutionary Catalonia to the recovered factories of Argentina and the
economic communes of Rojava.

From an anarchist perspective, self-management is not merely a technical
question of who holds decision-making authority within a firm. It is
inseparable from the broader project of eliminating hierarchy and
domination — the same impulse that abolishes the state must also abolish
the boss. Where capitalist firms concentrate authority in owners and
managers who extract surplus value from workers, self-managed
enterprises distribute that authority among those who actually perform
the work.[^1]

Self-management takes many structural forms depending on scale, context,
and the political traditions of those involved. These range from small
consensus-based collectives rotating all tasks equally, to large
federated networks of worker cooperatives, to industry-wide syndicalist
structures in which workers' assemblies replace both owners and
professional managers entirely.

## Origins

The idea of workers controlling their own labour has deep roots in
working-class struggle, but its systematic theoretical articulation
begins with <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, who in the
1840s argued that the exploitation of labour under capitalism depended
on the separation of workers from the means of production. His model of
<a href="mutualism" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">mutualism</a>
proposed cooperatives operating in a free-market framework, with workers
collectively owning and managing their workplaces.[^2]

<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and the collectivist
anarchists developed this further, arguing that workers' federations
should seize the means of production and manage them collectively
through unions and workers' councils, abolishing both capitalist
ownership and state control in a single revolutionary act.[^3]

<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> added a communist dimension, envisioning a society in
which self-managed workplaces abandoned wage labour altogether and
produced for collective need rather than market exchange, coordinating
through free federation rather than price signals.[^4]

The anarcho-syndicalist tradition, developed through organisations such
as the <a href="CNT" class="wikilink" title="CNT">CNT</a> in Spain,
argued that the
<a href="trade_union" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
union</a> itself was the basic organisational unit of self-management —
that workers could seize and run industries through their existing
organisations, rendering both the capitalist class and the state
redundant.[^5]

## Tendencies

### Worker Cooperatives

Worker cooperatives are enterprises owned and democratically managed by
their members, typically operating on a one-member-one-vote basis. While
cooperatives exist within capitalist market economies and therefore face
pressures that can erode their democratic character over time,
anarchists have generally viewed them as prefigurative forms — practical
demonstrations that workers can run complex enterprises without bosses.

The <a href="Mondragon_Corporation" class="wikilink"
title="Mondragon Corporation">Mondragon Corporation</a> in the Basque
Country of Spain is the most frequently cited large-scale example: a
federation of over 80 cooperatives employing more than 80,000
worker-owners across manufacturing, retail, and finance.[^6] The
<a href="Suma_Wholefoods" class="wikilink" title="Suma Wholefoods">Suma
Wholefoods</a> cooperative in the UK has operated on equal-pay
principles since 1975. In the United States,
<a href="Cooperation_Jackson" class="wikilink"
title="Cooperation Jackson">Cooperation Jackson</a> in Mississippi
builds a network of cooperatives as part of a broader solidarity economy
project rooted in Black liberation politics.

Smaller-scale examples are widespread: the
<a href="Cheeseboard_Collective" class="wikilink"
title="Cheeseboard Collective">Cheeseboard Collective</a> in Berkeley
has operated without managers since 1971, rotating all tasks including
administrative work among its members;
<a href="Rainbow_Grocery_Cooperative" class="wikilink"
title="Rainbow Grocery Cooperative">Rainbow Grocery Cooperative</a> in
San Francisco employs over 230 workers with all decisions made by
consensus and equal pay throughout.

### Revolutionary Syndicalism

Anarcho-syndicalism goes further than the cooperative model by seeking
not merely worker ownership of individual enterprises but collective
workers' control of entire industries through union structures, with no
separate managerial class whatsoever.

The <a href="Spanish_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> of 1936–39 remains the
most extensive historical example. Following the defeat of Franco's
military uprising in Catalonia and Aragon, the CNT and FAI organised the
collectivisation of factories, farms, and public services across much of
Republican Spain. Workers' assemblies made all decisions; administrative
tasks rotated among workers; delegates to coordinating bodies carried
binding mandates from their assemblies and were subject to immediate
recall. The textile industry, metallurgy, transport, and agriculture all
operated under these arrangements for up to three years before being
suppressed — first by Stalinist counter-revolution within the Republic,
then by Franco's final military victory.[^7]

In Argentina, the collapse of the economy in 2001 produced a wave of
factory occupations by workers abandoned by bankrupt or fleeing
employers. Enterprises including the Zanon ceramics factory (later
renamed FaSinPat — Fábrica Sin Patrones, or Factory Without Bosses) and
the <a href="Hotel_Bauen" class="wikilink" title="Hotel Bauen">Hotel
Bauen</a> in Buenos Aires were taken over and self-managed by their
workforces, operating without owners or managers. By 2020, approximately
16,000 Argentine workers ran around 400 such recovered enterprises.[^8]
The movement led in 2011 to a new bankruptcy law facilitating worker
takeovers.[^9]

### Consensus Collectives

Many anarchist and libertarian socialist organisations operate through
flat, consensus-based structures that eliminate leadership roles
entirely rather than simply democratising them. In these models, no
individual or committee holds permanent decision-making authority; all
binding decisions pass through a general assembly operating by consensus
or modified consensus.

The
<a href="Radical_Routes" class="wikilink" title="Radical Routes">Radical
Routes</a> network in the UK connects housing and worker cooperatives
using pure consensus decision-making, with tasks rotating regularly and
no permanent coordinators. Technology cooperatives including Agaric and
Palante Technology Cooperative operate on similar principles, combining
technical work with non-hierarchical governance. The
<a href="Black_Star_Co-op" class="wikilink"
title="Black Star Co-op">Black Star Co-op</a> in Austin, Texas, runs a
collectively managed pub and cultural space on consensus principles.

The Spanish CNT collectives in 1936–39 demonstrated that this model
could scale to industrial level: workers' assemblies were the highest
authority, delegates had no autonomous power but only carried out
assembly decisions, and instant recall ensured accountability. This was
not organisational chaos but a functioning alternative to managerial
hierarchy — one that, by most accounts, increased both productivity and
worker satisfaction compared to the capitalist enterprises it
replaced.[^10]

### Federated and Participatory Models

At larger scales, self-management requires coordination between
workplaces and communities. Anarchist thought addresses this through
federalism: voluntary association between self-managed units, with
delegates carrying mandated instructions upward through successive
levels of federation rather than representatives exercising independent
authority.

<a href="Murray_Bookchin" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>'s
<a href="libertarian_municipalism" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian municipalism">libertarian municipalism</a> proposed a
confederal system in which neighbourhood assemblies and workplace
councils federated upward through municipal and regional structures,
with coordination bodies handling logistics but policy decided at base
level.[^11]

Contemporary examples include the canton system in
<a href="Rojava" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> (Northeast
Syria), where neighbourhood communes send recallable delegates to
district communes and cantonal councils, with economic coordination
managed through commune assemblies rather than state or capitalist
structures.[^12] Kerala's People's Planning Campaign decentralised a
significant portion of the state budget to local assemblies, with
millions participating in decisions about resource allocation — a
partial but instructive example of participatory economic planning at
scale.

### Self-Management Within Capitalism

Some degree of worker participation in management exists within
enterprises that remain fundamentally capitalist — employee share
ownership schemes, worker representation on boards, and cooperative
structures operating under market constraints. Anarchists generally view
these as limited and potentially co-optive, but they serve as evidence
that hierarchy is not technically necessary for large-scale enterprise.

The <a href="John_Lewis_Partnership" class="wikilink"
title="John Lewis Partnership">John Lewis Partnership</a> in the UK
operates as an employee-owned trust with worker representatives in
governance. Yugoslav self-management between 1950 and the 1980s
established workers' councils with genuine authority over Yugoslav
enterprises, though within a single-party state framework — an
experiment ultimately ended by IMF structural adjustment programmes
rather than internal failure.[^13]

## Mechanisms Against Re-Hierarchy

Anarchist thinkers and practitioners have developed specific structural
mechanisms to prevent self-managed organisations from reproducing
hierarchy:

The **imperative mandate** binds delegates to specific instructions from
their assemblies. A delegate cannot negotiate or compromise beyond what
their assembly has authorised; they must return for new instructions
when circumstances change. This distinguishes anarchist delegation from
liberal representation, in which elected representatives exercise
independent judgment.

**Instant recall** allows base assemblies to remove delegates at any
point. This prevents delegation from becoming a permanent position and
maintains meaningful accountability — a representative who can only be
removed at fixed electoral intervals has substantial autonomy; a
delegate who can be recalled at the next meeting has almost none.

**Rotation of tasks** distributes coordination work broadly, prevents
the accumulation of expertise and information in permanent roles, and
ensures that everyone develops the skills needed for collective
management. Spanish CNT collectives rotated administrative tasks among
all workers; Zapatista autonomous communities rotate representative
roles, often monthly.

**Separation of coordination from policy** keeps logistics and
implementation distinct from decision-making. Coordination bodies handle
practical matters; policy is set at base assembly level. This prevents
administrative roles from accumulating political power.

## Criticism

Critics from both the right and the authoritarian left have questioned
whether self-management can operate at scale without reproducing the
coordination functions that hierarchical management performs. The
standard objections concern technical complexity, the time demands of
participatory decision-making, and the difficulty of coordinating
between multiple self-managed enterprises.

Anarchists point in response to the historical record: the Spanish
Revolution demonstrated self-management across entire industries for
years; the Mondragon cooperatives have operated successfully for
decades; the Argentine recovered factories have run complex
manufacturing operations without bosses for over twenty years. Where
self-managed societies have failed, the causes have generally been
external military force — Franco's army, the Red Army's suppression of
the <a href="Makhnovshchina" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">Makhnovshchina</a> — rather than internal
organisational breakdown.

The Marxist critique, particularly from Leninist traditions, argues that
workers' councils must be subordinated to a revolutionary party during
the transition to communism, and that self-management without state
coordination produces market anarchism rather than socialism. Anarchists
reject this as a rationalisation for substituting party authority for
both capitalist and worker power, and note that every Leninist
experiment ended not in the withering away of the state but in its
consolidation.[^14]

A further tension exists within cooperatives operating in capitalist
markets. Market pressures can drive cooperatives toward competitive
behaviour indistinguishable from capitalist firms — wage
differentiation, hiring non-member workers, prioritising profit over
democratic participation. This is not an argument against
self-management but for the anarchist position that workplace democracy
requires the transformation of the broader economy, not merely
individual enterprises.[^15]
