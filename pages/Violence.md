**Violence is** according to the World Health Organization's definition
of violence as "the intentional use of physical force or power,
threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a
group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of
resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or
deprivation." The reduction of violence to the lowest possible point is
a main goal of many political systems.
