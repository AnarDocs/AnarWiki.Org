# Jackson (The Last of Us)

## Overview

**Jackson** is a fictional post-apocalyptic community featured in the
video game series *The Last of Us* and its HBO television adaptation.
The settlement represents a functional example of
<a href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> in practice, operating
without centralized state authority through democratic council
governance, collective ownership of resources, and mutual aid
principles.

## History

### Formation

Following the collapse of the United States government during the
Cordyceps pandemic, the town of Jackson was established by survivors
seeking an alternative to the authoritarian
<a href="FEDRA.md" class="wikilink" title="FEDRA">FEDRA</a> quarantine
zones that dominated other population centers.[^1] In the HBO series
timeline, Maria and her group took over the abandoned area around 2016,
gradually building it into a self-sufficient community.[^2] Tommy
Miller, a former member of the
<a href="Fireflies.md" class="wikilink" title="Fireflies">Fireflies</a>
militant group, joined the community and married Maria, becoming
instrumental in its development.

The settlement secured a hydroelectric dam to provide electricity,
enabling the restoration of essential infrastructure including sewage
systems, plumbing, and lighting. By 2023, Jackson housed over 300
people, including children and elderly citizens, and had expanded to
include farms, greenhouses, livestock, and various community
facilities.[^3]

## Characteristics

### Political Structure

Jackson operates through a democratically elected council with no single
leader holding executive authority. Maria serves on this council, which
consists of eleven members in the HBO adaptation who make collective
decisions about community policy.[^4] The council governs through
consensus-building and majority votes, with proposals requiring six
votes to pass. Significantly, children are not disenfranchised from
participation in the democratic process.

When describing their system to outsiders, Maria explicitly identifies
Jackson as practicing
<a href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a>,
stating: "No one person's in charge. I'm on the council. Democratically
elected, serving 300 people, including children. Everyone pitches in. We
rotate patrols, food prep, repairs, hunting, harvesting. Everything you
see in our town ... greenhouses, livestock, all shared."[^5]

This structure aligns with anarchist principles of
<a href="horizontalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="horizontalism">horizontalism</a> and
<a href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a>, rejecting hierarchical
state authority in favor of participatory self-governance.

### Economic Organization

Jackson functions as a
<a href="commune.md" class="wikilink" title="commune">commune</a> based on
collective ownership and the principle of "from each according to
ability, to each according to need." The community maintains no currency
system, with all essential services including electricity, housing, food
production, and healthcare provided without payment or exchange value.

Resources are managed through Tommy's description of "collective
ownership," with all productive property - greenhouses, livestock,
farmland, and infrastructure - held in common rather than by private
individuals.[^6] Work is organized through voluntary rotation of
responsibilities rather than wage labor, with residents taking turns on
patrols, food preparation, repairs, hunting, and harvesting.

The town maintains various facilities including a multi-faith house of
worship, school, laundry, hospital, bar and restaurant, stores, and even
a cemetery, all operating on principles of mutual aid rather than
profit.[^7]

### Social Relations

Jackson appears to have achieved the
<a href="classless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="classless society">classless society</a> envisioned by anarchist
and communist theory. There are no landlords collecting rent, no
employers extracting surplus value from workers, and no religious
authority dictating moral codes. The multi-faith house of worship
indicates religious pluralism without
<a href="theocracy.md" class="wikilink" title="theocracy">theocracy</a>.

The community demonstrates
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
in practice, with residents supporting each other through collective
labor and shared resources. During crisis situations, such as infected
horde attacks, the entire community mobilizes according to ability - the
young and elderly shelter while able-bodied adults defend the
settlement.[^8]

### Positives

Jackson demonstrates the viability of anarchist organizing principles in
practice. The community successfully provides for material needs,
maintains infrastructure, and coordinates defense without hierarchical
management or state coercion. Democratic participation extends to all
ages, preventing the formation of a permanent ruling class.

The rotation of labor prevents the crystallization of a
<a href="division_of_labor.md" class="wikilink"
title="division of labor">division of labor</a> that could create new
class distinctions. By sharing both productive and unproductive work,
Jackson avoids the alienation inherent in capitalist specialization.

The settlement shows remarkable resilience, surviving and recovering
from attacks by infected hordes and hostile groups while maintaining its
egalitarian structure. This challenges the common assertion that
anarchist organization inevitably leads to chaos or vulnerability.

### Negatives

Jackson maintains defensive walls and armed patrols that function
somewhat like borders, though these appear oriented toward protection
from infected and raiders rather than controlling the movement of
residents. The community does operate an old bank building as a jail,
though Maria notes it has never been needed.[^9]

The settlement's relative isolation limits its revolutionary potential.
While Jackson embodies anarchist ideals internally, it exists as an
island surrounded by authoritarian forces including FEDRA zones and
militant groups. True anarchism, many theorists argue, requires the
dissolution of all states and the federation of autonomous communities.

Some critics might question whether the council structure constitutes a
form of government that contradicts pure anarchist theory, though others
would counter that democratic coordination does not equal hierarchy if
representatives can be recalled and hold no special privileges.

## Anarchist Analysis

Jackson serves as a fictional illustration of
<a href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> and
<a href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> in practice. The
community fulfills the three core criteria that
<a href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
identified for communism: it is classless, moneyless, and arguably
stateless.

The settlement demonstrates that the "A" within the circle "O" -
representing
<a href="Anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchy">Anarchy</a> within
<a href="Organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="Organization">Organization</a> - need not be contradictory.
Jackson maintains high functionality through voluntary coordination and
shared accountability rather than through hierarchical command
structures.

Director Jasmila Žbanić, who directed the HBO episode featuring Jackson,
drew on her experience during the siege of Sarajevo: "We had to be on
alert, we had to survive, we had to learn how to live without anything,
without civilisation... But we managed to survive because of solidarity,
and the way the city was restructured... I really believe even in the
worst catastrophes, like war, I survived. People are able to keep the
society."[^10]

Sociologist
<a href="David_Graeber.md" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a> argued that anarchist cooperative communities have been the
default for most of human history. Jackson's fictional success echoes
historical examples such as
<a href="Revolutionary_Catalonia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a>, the
<a href="Free_Territory.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Territory">Free
Territory</a> of Ukraine, and contemporary experiments in
<a href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> and the
<a href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
communities of

## Cultural Impact

The explicit identification of Jackson as communist sparked considerable
discussion among viewers of the HBO adaptation. Some right-wing
commentators criticized this as "woke" political messaging, while others
argued it provided rare positive representation of communist organizing
principles in mainstream media.

The exchange where Joel scoffs "So, uh, communism" and Maria responds
"It is that. Literally. This is a commune. We're communists" became
widely circulated on social media, prompting debates about the meaning
of communism beyond the authoritarian states historically associated
with the term.
