To be a Libertarian is to be a

believe in being free of hierarchy and class, free of others owning you,
or others owning what you need to survive.

The word ‘Libertarian’ has always meant this. It still does to most
people throughout the Spanish and French speaking world, and among those
who the word was created to describe.

French Libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque first used the word in
America in a letter to mutualist anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in
1857.[^1] It was the antithesis of Capitalism, and was a reject of
Capitalist coercion, commodification and exploitation.

From Benjamin Tucker in the 1870s to Murray Bookchin in the 1950s, and
Noam Chomsky to the present day it has been and continues to be used by
American Libertarian Socialists.[^2]

However, in the 1970s along came right wing proponents of unregulated
capitalism like (antisemitic misogynist fascist-loving) Murray
Rothbard.[^3] He knew what the word meant. He knew what an Anarchist and
a Communist was. But he and others couldn't come up with their own cool
word for their selfish ideology, so they stole the word 'Libertarian',
co-opted it, and boasted of doing so:

> ‘One gratifying aspect of our rise to some prominence is that, for the
> first time in my memory, we, “our side”, had captured a crucial word
> from the enemy. “Libertarians” had long been simply a polite word for
> left-wing anarchists, that is for anti-private property anarchists,
> either of the communist or syndicalist variety. But now we had taken
> it over.’[^4]

But us on the Left need to take it back, and give it back it's original
meaning. As Murray Bookchin did and encouraged others to do:

> ‘This movement never created the word: it appropriated it from the
> anarchist movement of the \[19th\] century. And it should be recovered
> by those anti-authoritarians... who try to speak for dominated people
> as a whole, not for personal egotists who identify freedom with
> entrepreneurship and profit.’[^5]
