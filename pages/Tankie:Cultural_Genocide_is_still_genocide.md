### Notes

- For some reason, a lot of people on the left don’t know it was
  settler-states (eg. Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, South
  Africa, Brazil) and colonial powers (eg. France, United Kingdom) who
  actively block any attempt of incorporating destruction of culture,
  religion, language and intelligentsia as “genocide”.
