From Janet Biehl, *The Politics of Social Ecology: Libertarian
Municipalism*:

> Today Switzerland, because it is still a confederation, seems
> anomalous among the relatively more unitary Nation States of Europe.
> But in earlier times, in central Europe especially, it was
> confederations that were the norm and States that were the anomaly.
> Confederations abounded in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
> like the Rhenish and Swabian leagues. Switzerland merely preserved
> much of this older confederal trend, while its neighbours underwent
> centralization to become more modern States. Its governmental
> structure is still relatively decentralized, made up of twenty-two
> cantons, which still have a good deal of autonomy from the federal
> level; in turn the three thousand communes still have some autonomy
> from/the cantons in which they are located.
>
> But Switzerland today also has many State features (as well as
> attitudes, institutions, and social features that are not at all
> enlightened). Swiss confederalism is far more interesting
> historically. Most strikingly, in the country’s easternmost
> territory—which was once called Raetia by the Romans and is now called
> the canton of Graubunden—the Swiss communes formed confederations for
> their common welfare and safety.
>
> At the beginning of the sixteenth century in Raetia, three confederal
> leagues (the Gotteshausbund, the Oberbund or LGrauer Bund, and the
> Zehngerichtenbund) coexisted. In 1524 these three leagues allied to
> form the Free State of the Three Leagues, which despite its "Statist"
> name was a confederation. The Free State confederation lasted for
> almost three centuries, until Napoleon forced it into the Swiss
> Confederation in 1803.
>
> All three of its component leagues, in turn, were made up of communes
> that were remarkably democratic and free. Indeed, the ultimate
> sovereignty in the Free State together proposed referenda and carried
> out the will of the communes. The commissioners had the right to
> handle foreign affairs and to prevent the component leagues from
> making foreign alliances on their own. But the communes themselves
> decided upon matters, of war and peace, as well as domestic issues.
>
> The central “government” thus had almost no power, while the
> communes—that is, the citizens themselves, in assembly—had a great
> deal. In effect, the commissioners were merely attendants upon the
> people. Ultimately they lost to the communes even the power to handle
> diplomacy and make treaties. In general, the history of Raetia for
> these three centuries is a striking testimony to the ability of
> direct-democratic communities to govern themselves in confederal
> union.
