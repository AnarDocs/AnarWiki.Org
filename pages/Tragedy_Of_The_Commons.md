# Tragedy of the Commons

## Overview

The **tragedy of the commons** is a discredited economic theory
popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968, which falsely claims
that individuals with unfettered access to a shared resource will
inevitably overexploit and destroy it through rational self-interest.
The concept has been widely criticized as historically inaccurate, used
as propaganda to justify "<a   href="privatization.md" class="wikilink"
title="privatization">"privatization</a> and the
"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">"enclosure</a> of
common resources, and rooted in racist and
"<a   href="eugenics.md" class="wikilink" title="eugenicist">"eugenicist</a>
ideology.

Despite its widespread citation, the theory fundamentally misunderstands
how "<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="commons">"commons</a>
actually functioned historically and ignores centuries of successful
collective management of shared resources. The work of Nobel Prize
winner
"<a   href="Elinor_Ostrom.md" class="wikilink" title="Elinor Ostrom">"Elinor
Ostrom</a> and numerous other scholars has thoroughly refuted Hardin's
central claims, demonstrating that communities have consistently
developed sophisticated systems for sustainably managing common
resources without private ownership or state control.

## Origins

### Classical Precursors

The concept of resource depletion in shared spaces was discussed by
"<a   href="Aristotle.md" class="wikilink" title="Aristotle">"Aristotle</a>,
who observed that "that which is common to the greatest number has the
least care bestowed upon it."[^1] However, this observation did not
account for the complex social systems that governed commons usage in
practice.

### Lloyd's Pamphlet (1833)

English economist William Forster Lloyd published a pamphlet containing
a hypothetical example of overgrazing on common land.[^2] Critically,
Lloyd's pamphlet was written **after** the
"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">"enclosure</a>
movement had already eliminated most common property in England, and his
description has been shown to be historically inaccurate. The system he
described never actually existed in the way he portrayed it.

### Hardin's 1968 Essay

In 1968, Garrett Hardin published "The Tragedy of the Commons" in the
journal *Science*.[^3] Hardin's primary concern was human
overpopulation, and he used the commons metaphor to argue for "mutual
coercion, mutually agreed upon" to restrict reproductive rights,
particularly targeting non-white populations. He later admitted he
should have titled his work "The Tragedy of the **Unregulated**
Commons," acknowledging that his original framing was misleading.[^4]

## Historical Inaccuracy

### The Reality of Common Land Management

The "tragedy of the commons" is based on a **fundamental
misunderstanding** of how common property actually functioned
historically. Research by legal scholars and historians has thoroughly
demolished Hardin's claims:

**Common land was not open access.** Every parcel of common land had a
legal owner (the lord of the manor), and only specific individuals
(commoners) had legal rights to use portions of it. Not everyone in the
vicinity could graze animals on common land.[^5]

**Usage was strictly regulated by law.** The right to graze on common
land was limited precisely to prevent overgrazing. These limits were
enforced by manorial courts, which could fine both commoners and lords
for violations of customary law.[^6]

**The system worked for centuries.** Common land systems endured for
hundreds of years without producing the disastrous effects claimed by
Lloyd and Hardin. As Carl Dahlman and others have demonstrated, commons
were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.[^7]

Professor Christopher Rodgers stated unequivocally: "Hardin's
influential thesis on the 'tragedy of the commons' has **no application
to common land in England and Wales**. It is based on a **false
premise**."[^8]

### Susan Cox's "Triumph of the Commons"

Susan Jane Buck Cox demonstrated that what Hardin described was actually
the "**triumph of the commons**" - successful common usage of land for
many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural
innovation, not the behavior of commoners, led to the demise of commons
systems.[^9]

## Political Uses and Criticisms

### Tool of Dispossession

The "tragedy of the commons" has been wielded as **propaganda for
private ownership** and used to justify the dispossession of indigenous
peoples and the enclosure of common resources worldwide. As radical
environmentalist
"<a   href="Derrick_Jensen.md" class="wikilink" title="Derrick Jensen">"Derrick
Jensen</a> argues, it has been used by the political right wing to
hasten the final enclosure of common resources of third world and
indigenous peoples as part of the
"<a   href="Washington_Consensus.md" class="wikilink"
title="Washington Consensus">"Washington Consensus</a>.[^10]

Jensen contends it should be called "the Tragedy of the **Failure** of
the Commons" - emphasizing that in true commons situations, those who
abuse resources face social sanctions and community enforcement.

### Marxist Critique

Geographer
"<a   href="David_Harvey.md" class="wikilink" title="David Harvey">"David
Harvey</a> asks: "Why do we not focus in Hardin's metaphor on the
individual ownership of the cattle rather than on the pasture as a
common?"[^11] Harvey notes that the dispossession of indigenous
populations was justified because they "did not produce value" according
to capitalist metrics, revealing the ideological nature of commons
critiques.

According to
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a>,
privatization merely displaces problems while putting increasing numbers
in precarious situations. The "<a   href="enclosure_acts.md" class="wikilink"
title="enclosure acts">"enclosure acts</a> in England pushed people into
smaller pockets of remaining common land, exacerbating rather than
solving resource issues.[^12]

### Use Against Nomadic Peoples

Douglas L. Johnson notes that many nomadic pastoralist societies
"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in
ways that were ecologically sound," yet "the nomad was blamed for
problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien
forces."[^13]

Governments have used Hardin's work to justify restrictions on land
access and forced sedentarization of pastoral nomads, despite weak
empirical basis. Dawn Chatty documents how this merged with nationalist
ideology viewing nomads as backward in countries like Syria.[^14]

### Hardin's Racist and Eugenicist Views

Hardin's arguments were explicitly directed toward forcible population
control, particularly of people of color. The
"<a   href="Southern_Poverty_Law_Center.md" class="wikilink"
title="Southern Poverty Law Center">"Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has
documented Hardin's racist and eugenicist views.[^15]

In 1991, Hardin wrote disparagingly of "popular anthropology" with its
"dogma that all cultures are equally good" and complained about how
"Black became beautiful, and prolonged bilingual education replaced
naturalization."[^16] His views on overpopulation have been criticized
as simplistic and racist.[^17]

## Elinor Ostrom's Refutation

### Nobel Prize-Winning Research

Political scientist
"<a   href="Elinor_Ostrom.md" class="wikilink" title="Elinor Ostrom">"Elinor
Ostrom</a> received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics for her work
demonstrating that **the tragedy of the commons is not as prevalent or
difficult to solve as Hardin maintained**. Ostrom and colleagues found
that locals have often developed their own solutions to commons
management.[^18]

### Successful Commons Management

Ostrom identified key factors for successful commons management:

- **Definable boundaries** for the resource
- **Resource dependence** - clear threats and difficulty finding
  substitutes
- **Community presence** - small, stable populations with thick social
  networks
- **Appropriate rules** - community-based procedures with incentives for
  responsible use and punishments for overuse

Examples include:

- A commons in the **Swiss Alps** managed collectively by farmers since
  1517[^19]
- **Beaver management** by indigenous peoples in Canada who maintained
  sustainable harvests for centuries[^20]
- Numerous examples of fisheries, irrigation systems, and farmlands
  successfully managed communally

When commons are taken over by non-locals or states, these local
solutions often fail.

## Anarchist Perspective

### Commons-Based Organization

Many of the structures Ostrom identified for successful commons
management align with
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
organizational principles, particularly those of
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchism">"green
anarchism</a>.[^21] Key principles include:

- **Decentralized decision-making** by those directly affected
- **Community self-management** rather than state or private control
- **Horizontal organization** with democratic participation
- **Direct enforcement** through social pressure rather than police
- **Local autonomy** in rule-making and resource management

### Contemporary Anarchist Examples

The largest contemporary societies successfully using commons-based
organizational strategies include:

- The
  "<a   href="Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities">"Rebel Zapatista
  Autonomous Municipalities</a> in Mexico
- The "<a   href="Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria.md"
  class="wikilink"
  title="Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria">"Autonomous
  Administration of North and East Syria</a> (Rojava)

Both have been heavily influenced by anarchism and
"<a   href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">"libertarian socialism</a>, demonstrating
that large-scale commons management remains viable.

### Digital Commons

Modern examples of
"<a   href="commons-based_peer_production.md" class="wikilink"
title="commons-based peer production">"commons-based peer production</a>
demonstrate the continued relevance of commons organizing:

- **"<a   href="Wikipedia.md" class="wikilink" title="Wikipedia">"Wikipedia</a>** -
  collaboratively maintained knowledge commons
- **"<a   href="Free_and_open_source_software.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Free and open source software">"Free and open source software</a>** -
  collectively developed code
- **"<a   href="Open-source_hardware.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Open-source hardware">"Open-source hardware</a>** - shared
  technical designs

Scholar
"<a   href="Yochai_Benkler.md" class="wikilink" title="Yochai Benkler">"Yochai
Benkler</a> coined the term "commons-based peer production" and argued
that cheap computing plus networks enable "a system of production,
distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by
decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed,
nonmarket means."[^22]

## Real Environmental Problems

While Hardin's theory is flawed, genuine environmental crises exist:

### Actual vs. Theoretical Problems

- **Climate change** - caused by capitalist overproduction and fossil
  fuel extraction, not traditional commons
- **Overfishing** - often in privatized or state-controlled waters, not
  community-managed fisheries
- **Deforestation** - driven by agribusiness and logging corporations,
  not subsistence communities
- **Pollution** - product of industrial capitalism prioritizing profit
  over environmental health

These problems stem from **lack of community control** and **capitalist
property relations**, not from commons arrangements. They represent the
opposite of what Hardin described - they are "tragedies of
privatization" and state mismanagement.

### The Resource Curse

Powerful companies and governments corrupt institutions to exploit
resources, concentrating wealth and power - the
**"<a   href="resource_curse.md" class="wikilink"
title="resource curse">"resource curse</a>**.[^23] This demonstrates how
privatization and state control, not commons arrangements, enable
resource destruction.

## Solutions: Anarchist Approaches

### Community Self-Management

Rather than privatization or state regulation, anarchists advocate:

- **Direct community control** over local resources
- **Federated coordination** for larger-scale resources
- **Consensus decision-making** among those affected
- **Rotating responsibilities** to prevent power concentration
- **Transparent processes** for resource allocation

### Legal Personhood for Nature

Some indigenous movements have secured **legal personhood for rivers and
ecosystems**, enabling protection through guardianship rather than
ownership:

- The **Whanganui River** in New Zealand gained legal personhood through
  Māori advocacy[^24]
- Ecuador's **Pacha Mama** (Mother Earth) constitutional principle[^25]

These bottom-up initiatives challenge property-based frameworks.

### Boycotts and Direct Action

Individuals and communities can:

- **Boycott** products from destructive industries
- **Occupy and defend** threatened commons and ecosystems
- **Create alternative institutions** for resource management
- **Practice mutual aid** in resource sharing
- **Resist enclosure** through direct action

## Criticism Summary

The "tragedy of the commons" fails on multiple levels:

**Historical**: Commons were successfully managed for centuries through
community regulation, not destroyed by overuse[^26]

**Empirical**: Elinor Ostrom's research proves communities regularly
solve commons problems without privatization or state control[^27]

**Political**: The theory serves as propaganda justifying dispossession
of indigenous peoples and enclosure of resources[^28]

**Ideological**: Rooted in racist, eugenicist views and used to justify
coercive population control[^29]

**Practical**: Real environmental destruction comes from capitalism and
state mismanagement, not traditional commons[^30]
