# Popular Assemblies

*Note: This is an imperfect compilation of views and suggestions on
assemblies which should be refined over time.*

## Overview

Popular assemblies are non-hierarchical gatherings where ordinary people
meet to discuss issues, make collective decisions, and organize action
in their communities. Operating through direct democracy rather than
representation, assemblies give decision-making power directly to
participants rather than delegates or elected officials. Throughout
history, assemblies have emerged spontaneously during periods of social
crisis and revolution, serving as organs of popular power that challenge
hierarchical institutions like states and corporations.

Assemblies can form in neighborhoods, workplaces, schools, villages, or
any location where people share common concerns. They typically use
mandated and recallable delegates to coordinate activities between
different assemblies, though these delegates implement decisions rather
than making them. This system of decentralized direct democracy
represents the embryo of an anarchist society organized through
voluntary non-hierarchical associations rather than authoritarian
institutions.[^1]

## Historical Development

### Early Examples

During the French Revolution (1790-93), poor people called sans-culottes
formed neighborhood assemblies called sections. Using mandated and
recallable delegates to coordinate their activities, these sections
played a role in overthrowing the King before the Jacobins, advocates of
representative government, shut them down and launched a reign of
terror.[^2]

At the end of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, Russian workers, peasants
and others rebelled against the Tsar. Peasants took over land from
landlords as village assemblies began running villages. Workers went on
strike and took over factories, forming worker assemblies. They used
mandated and recallable delegates who met in meetings called Soviets to
coordinate their actions. The Tsar granted concessions, including
creation of an elected parliament, and repressed those who continued to
rebel.[^3]

### Mexican and Russian Revolutions

During the Mexican Revolution (1910-19), numerous peasant rebellions
fought for land redistribution. In villages where government forces had
been driven out, land was expropriated from landlords and decentralized
direct democracy practiced. Village assemblies and councils formed to
run the villages. Mexican nationalists eventually came to power, playing
workers and peasants against each other, defeating peasant armies and
shutting down popular assemblies.[^4]

In February 1917, a spontaneous rebellion overthrew the Russian Tsar and
created a Republican government. Worker assemblies and Soviets
reappeared as peasant assemblies took over land and workers took over
factories. In October 1917, the Bolshevik party led an insurrection
establishing a one-party dictatorship. By mid-1918, the Soviets had gone
from directly democratic forms of coordination to representative
institutions to rubber-stamping Bolshevik party decisions with no real
power. The Bolsheviks forcibly dispersed popular assemblies, though
rebellions seeking to reestablish them continued through 1921.[^5]

### Ukrainian Revolution

In Spring 1918, peasant village assemblies in Ukraine formed Free
Soviets that, unlike Russian versions subordinated to the Bolsheviks,
were free of political parties and controlled by peasants and workers.
In some places resources were pooled and communes formed. Decentralized
democratic militias fought against reactionaries and foreign invaders.
Anarchists, especially Nestor Makhno, played important roles in
organizing these structures. These partisan groups defeated Germans,
Austrians, Ukrainian Nationalists and two white armies before the
Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine in 1921, violently suppressing the communes,
Free Soviets and popular assemblies.[^6]

### Spanish Revolution

On 19 July 1936, workers fought and defeated a Fascist coup in
two-thirds of Spain, launching an anarcho-syndicalist revolution. As the
state effectively dissolved, workers and peasants took over land and
factories, forming collectives throughout anti-fascist Spain. In some
villages money was abolished and anarcho-communism implemented. Worker
and village assemblies, along with federations of assemblies, took over
running the economy. Democratic militias formed to fight the Fascists.

However, anarcho-syndicalists chose not to complete the revolution by
forming neighborhood assemblies and completely abolishing money. Instead
they allowed the state to be restored to form an alliance with other
anti-fascist groups. Over the following year the state gradually
restored its power, recreating hierarchical military and police forces.
In May 1937, anarchists were kicked out of government and an offensive
against the collectives launched. The collectives were eventually
destroyed, land and industries either nationalized or turned into
private property. This destruction of the revolution demoralized the
population and the Fascists won the civil war.[^7]

### Post-War Examples

After Japan's defeat in World War Two, workers took over factories and
peasants took over land in Korea, setting up popular assemblies and
self-managed communes. The United States and Stalinist Russia divided
Korea, setting up brutal dictatorships in each half that violently shut
down popular assemblies.[^8]

In 1956, rebellions against Stalinist client states throughout Eastern
Europe led to the overthrow of Hungary's government by worker, peasant
and student rebellions. Peasant and worker councils and assemblies were
established before Russia invaded and crushed the rebellion.[^9]

In March 1968, French students began rebelling against the state. In
universities, student assemblies formed based on non-hierarchical
directly democratic principles, challenging the state and university
administrations. This catalyzed massive rebellion. Workers started
taking over workplaces and a general strike was called. Communist party
leaders and reformist trade unions attempted to separate workers and
students to maintain power over the working class. By mediating between
the masses and ruling class, they helped end the potential revolution
and return France to normalcy.[^10]

### Contemporary Movements

On 25 April 1974, a military rebellion overthrew Portugal's Fascist
dictatorship and a multi-party republic was created. Worker assemblies
and committees formed to fight for improved conditions and in some cases
took over workplaces. Neighborhood assemblies and committees fought for
better housing, sometimes taking over unused buildings. At one point
there were 380 self-managed factories and 500 co-ops. Most participants
retained a reformist perspective, wanting to improve their situation
within the system. This assisted the revolution's decline, as the ruling
class only had to grant concessions to stay in power. The decline also
resulted from authoritarian leftist parties attempting to take over
assemblies and committees to seize power for themselves.[^11]

In 1978, wave of worker unrest in Iran unseated the Shah. Workers
councils called Shoras were set up and many factories, offices,
hospitals and universities were taken over. In February 1979,
fundamentalist Muslim clerics seized power, establishing a theocratic
republic and suppressing all other factions as well as the Shoras.[^12]

Shortly after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an Iraqi anti-war movement
organized and rebellions erupted throughout Iraq after war with the
US-led coalition began. Iraqi troops mutinied and in the north, workers
councils called Shoras formed. US forces massacred retreating mutinous
troops and suspended hostilities with the Iraqi state so Saddam Hussein
could crush the workers' rebellion. Kurdish nationalists, who opposed
the Shoras, also played a role in defeating the rebellion.[^13]

On 1 January 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army launched an
offensive against the Mexican government in Chiapas. Unlike many
previous armed revolutionary groups, the Zapatistas chose not to seize
state power but instead allowed people in liberated areas to organize
themselves. Village assemblies have been formed and in many cases land
has been expropriated and collectivized. These assemblies still exist
today.[^14]

In April 2001, provoked by police murder of a high-school boy, an
insurrection in the Kabylia region of Algeria erupted against the
military dictatorship. The movement organized itself into aarchs -
village and neighborhood assemblies. They created a system of mandated
and recallable delegates to coordinate actions of different aarchs. The
insurrection has continued through subsequent years, though centered in
Kabylia, with rebellion erupting in other parts of Algeria as well.[^15]

On 19 December 2001, Argentine President Fernando de la Rua declared a
state of siege in response to collapsing economy and increasing unrest,
effectively turning Argentina into a dictatorship. Tens of thousands
took to the streets in mass uprising. De la Rua was forced to resign and
the state of siege ended. Over the next two weeks Argentina had five
Presidents as insurrections rocked the country. The government defaulted
on its debt rather than implement another round of IMF-imposed austerity
programs. Worker and neighborhood assemblies formed, using mandated and
recallable delegates to coordinate activities. Workers started taking
over workplaces. In the first half of 2003 these assemblies declined due
to leveling off of the economic crisis, attempts by authoritarian
leftist groups to take over assemblies, government repression, and a
Presidential election creating the illusion that government could solve
their problems.[^16]

## Spanish Workers Assembly Movement

The workers assembly movement that shook Spain from 1976 to 1978
represented the independent manifestation of the proletariat and
confirmation of class struggle's existence in a country where both
dictatorship and politicians of the transition had fought against it for
forty years by concealing it. It was the spontaneous response of the
Spanish proletariat to Francoism's political exhaustion, superimposed on
the general economic crisis affecting the capitalist world, at the
moment when dictatorship attempted controlled adaptation of its
institutions to democratic forms.

The assembly movement was an uprising against all forms of exploitation
that escaped the narrow framework of bourgeois politics intended for
containing workers, exposing the anti-Francoist opposition when the
latter was preparing to negotiate for more European forms of social
slavery in return for a share in their management. The return of class
organization of the proletariat and class-consciousness was a constant
demand of direct democracy in struggle, reminiscent of the anarchist
tradition of the Spanish proletariat, including rejection of leadership
vanguards, politics, trade union reformism, and all representation
separate from the class, and the practice of solidarity, self-defense,
direct dialogue and general strike as specific methods of struggle.[^17]

Strikes began in January 1976 in Madrid and slowly spread throughout the
country, surprising everyone by their combativeness and magnitude, and
especially due to generalization of workers assemblies - resolute and
alert organs for collective discussion and decision-making demonstrating
workers' will to manage their own affairs rather than leave them to
others. Assemblies elected delegates and spread strikes everywhere,
often through simple class solidarity, taking to the streets and
flouting existing laws as well as official trade union structures. Their
entrance brought qualitative change to the situation, bringing existing
class antagonism into the foreground. Assemblies, created for discussing
labor problems and selecting those responsible for negotiating with
employers, became true power - independent, with enormous force, full of
possibilities becoming apparent to many workers.[^18]

In Vitoria in February and March 1976, the assembly movement reached its
high point. The general strike torpedoed any gradualist reform and
rehabilitation project, unmasking the pact concluded by Francoist
rearguard with opposition. The Vitoria strike imposed representative
committees of delegates, elected and revocable, simultaneously forcing
resignation of official and informal trade unionism. Workers occupied
streets and assemblies formed in all different domains of public life.
The movement shed its spontaneous character to coordinate activities and
organize self-defense. Tolerance came to an end and workers of Vitoria
were mowed down with machine guns. Government and opposition managed to
contain revolt provoked by police shootings to the Basque Country, with
solidarity of workers in the rest of Spain scattered and harshly
repressed.[^19]

The movement failed to achieve lasting success partly due to absence of
definite revolutionary current among assemblyists contributing to
confusion. When opportunity to move to higher stage of struggle against
Capital and State presented itself, class instinct was not enough -
class-consciousness became decisive factor: knowledge of conditions of
struggle as a whole, clear understanding of reality, precise judgment of
capitalist social order. The proletariat's fight against class society
obliges it to take on the problem of understanding itself. Parallel with
economic struggle, a struggle over consciousness develops - a struggle
for understanding of society. Both struggles are intertwined, each real
only if the other accompanies it. The sole precondition is autonomous
action of the proletariat. If the proletariat does not succeed in making
itself independent of representations external to it, its process of
emancipation falters and ends.[^20]

## Organizing Popular Assemblies

### Fundamental Principles

Building neighborhood democracy through popular assemblies rests on
several fundamental assumptions. First, structures of domination like
capitalism and the state exist at numerous levels but ultimately
exercise their power locally. National administrations, transnational
firms and international governmental bodies shape on-the-ground social
reality in outsized ways, but ultimately on-the-ground agencies, firms
and individuals must execute decisions in specific locations.
Understanding these facts, their patterns and addresses, makes
disruption possible.

Second, confronting these structures requires organizing people,
motivating them to build and wield collective power they would not have
as individuals. Organizing means working with ordinary people to shape
ourselves into a fighting force capable of standing up to and eventually
dismantling capitalism, the state and other structures of domination.
This is a question of power - building the power of coworkers,
neighbors, classmates and other actors of struggle to dismantle the
ruling class's dominating, atomizing power over us. We build people's
confidence to make demands and directly act against bosses, politicians,
landlords, administrators and other class enemies to win specific goals
and shift relations of power in workplaces, neighborhoods, schools and
other arenas of social life. We encourage everyday people to run these
struggles with formal, directly-democratic bodies that we can one day
use to run all of society.[^21]

Third, direct decisions must mean direct actions. Once we directly
decide how to solve our problem, we do not push that solution onto some
other body like government, a nonprofit or corporation to do it for us -
we do it ourselves. We must prepare ourselves to take on whatever we
decide to fight, learning new skills, developing new techniques and
committing to what can sometimes be boring work.

Fourth, trust - in each other, the project and in possibilities of a
better world - motivates action. While strong emotions may initially
motivate people's interest in struggle, what keeps them in it is trust:
trust in reliable co-organizers and comrades who have their back when it
is time to act, trust that their efforts plausibly build to something
better, trust that they can change the world. Popular assembly
organizers must cultivate trust among people who live near each other so
they have potential to make their slice of the world better and lay
foundations for social revolution that can completely transform it.[^22]

### Getting Started

In the United States, increased churn in employment and living
situations spurred by economic instability and cultural warnings that
danger lurks behind every corner mean we rarely know people who live
next door to us. To make a popular assembly successful, you need to know
the people you are organizing, especially what can motivate their
interest and trust to continually come together, make decisions and
execute them.

The first step is to meet the people you want to bring together and
better understand their stories. Knock on your neighbors' doors, shake
their hands and tell them your name and why you are there. In these
conversations, you are trying to learn what makes them tick and what
they care about so that you can agitate them - not browbeating or riling
them up about the worst aspects of the system, nor winning them to a set
of values or revolutionary project right off the bat, but asking them to
think deeply about their lives and the kinds of social problems that
worry them. Those experiences and that information will get you thinking
about the kind of shared issues that your neighborhood's popular
assembly may aim to solve. When you find people eager to do something
about issues, consider recruiting them to help launch the popular
assembly.[^23]

Alongside building relationships with people who live near you, build
them with already existing popular neighborhood organizations - any
group in an area bringing together people who might not otherwise have a
relationship with each other, such as cultural centers, labor unions,
local churches, parent meetups, reading groups, student clubs or sports
leagues. These connections will help spread the word about meetings you
want to call and encourage their members' participation. They might also
provide resources making meetings more accessible like physical
infrastructure or translation services. However, avoid political parties
or nonprofits, as these organizations typically aim to solve problems on
behalf of people seeking solutions, often aim to absorb organic efforts
into their programming and rarely have deep pull in communities.[^24]

### Calling and Running Meetings

When you have a sense of your neighbors' concerns, it is time to bring
them together to discuss. Consider logistics like space to meet, keeping
in mind size, proximity and accessibility. Public parks, schools and
libraries can often be rented for small fees. Once you have scheduled
time and place, get out the word about it through social media, posting
on local newspaper event pages, asking popular local social media
accounts to share a flier, revisiting each neighbor you previously
contacted, hanging up posters around restaurants, grocery stores and
laundromats. Lean on existing popular neighborhood organizations to get
out the word and invite their people to upcoming meetings.[^25]

Put together an agenda with clear goals and objectives to accomplish
during your meeting. Goals should be clear enough and given enough time
within the meeting to accomplish. Using action verbs to describe what
you plan to do can encourage widespread involvement among meeting
attendees. Present the goals, items and activities you have put together
as preliminary, asking questions like "Does anyone want to change
anything in the agenda?" to invite participants to shape it, then take a
vote to approve the agenda before beginning.

Ensuring your meetings are places where everyone can contribute is
paramount for participants to directly decide their futures. Language is
a primary consideration - if you cannot understand what each other is
sharing, how can you arrive at a decision to do something about them?
Plan to meet your neighbors' language needs by making available
translated written information and real-time interpretation during
meetings. Skilled facilitators who keep engagement rolling while focused
on agenda items ensure participants' time and contributions are
respected. Adopting mechanisms like progressive stack - prioritizing
contributions from people who have not shared yet or are from
marginalized backgrounds - is one way to address how some people feel
more comfortable and willing to share.[^26]

### Decision-Making

Facilitating conversations among your neighbors is a major part of this
process, but popular assemblies must be committed places to make
decisions and later execute them. One way to prepare meeting attendees
for decision-making mindsets and practices is by approving the agenda at
the top of the meeting. Develop criteria for when your popular assembly
adopts a decision. Voting thresholds can range from unanimous or
modified consensus to supermajority or majority-plus-one votes.

While consensus decision-making - the practice of discussing and
debating a proposal until all participants are in agreement - is often
preferred by radicals, consider its drawbacks and limitations in the
context of a neighborhood popular assembly. Many participating will not
be able or willing to regularly devote hours of limited free time to
prolonged discussions. While deliberation is critical, so too is ability
to actually arrive at a decision. A balance between discussion,
opportunity to dissent and efficiency is needed. Simple majority voting
mechanisms are often most conducive to achieving immediate objectives
while remaining consistent with dedication to principle of direct
democracy. Whatever voting arrangements you decide, encourage the
popular assembly to regularly make decisions together.[^27]

As the popular assembly narrows on an issue plaguing the community -
fear of immigration raids, neighborhood displacement and gentrification,
police harassment, disaster relief or anything else - find the cracks in
the system. Where are holes you can poke? Where can communitywide
pressure be put and action taken against them? Once you find those
cracks, find ways to exploit them and offer potential solutions with
collective action. Consider what short, medium and long-term structures
and practices can directly challenge them, and get to work taking the
action. Any specific solution might require multiple people-packed teams
to make it work. Do not be afraid of starting subcommittees to complete
work between big meetings, but always document what you did, what
worked, what did not and any lessons learned you can pass down to future
participants.[^28]

### Sustaining the Assembly

A popular assembly is not just intended to solve one discrete problem
with a group of neighbors. It is a building block of a new world where
everyday people collectively take control over their communities and
lives. The lone organizer or small handful can be a death knell for a
popular assembly, putting pressure on them and risking burnout. Small
groups of organizers can hold lots of tacit knowledge about ins and outs
of an assembly, and in extreme scenarios an assembly can stop operating
altogether when core organizers step back.

Consciously recruit and build up confidence, skills and investment of
newly activated organizers throughout the assembly's development. Create
accessible on-ramps for participation: gently delegate tasks to
complete, offer support to see them through it, congratulate them when
they accomplish it and debrief with them when it does not go according
to plan. This develops organizing practice demonstrating none of us can
do this alone and we must support each other to accomplish our goals.

A popular assembly must recognize when hitting walls or hearing new
predominant concerns and facilitate discussions among each other about
where or what to do about them. Do not be afraid to broach new topics
and issues to address, encouraging the neighborhood to keep its
concerns, suggested solutions and collective action at center of the
popular assembly.[^29]

## Communalist Framework

Communalism refers to the means and ends of directly democratic,
non-hierarchical, co-federated community assemblies that seek to meet
people's needs via mutual aid, oppose hierarchy and domination via
direct action, and build the new world within the shell of the old
towards formation of dual power, revolution and libertarian communism.
It is a praxis that applies universal practices to particular contexts,
adapting to relevant conditions and variables accordingly. Communalist
projects seek to intertwine reconstructive politics, oppositional
politics, principled action and consequential efficacy, using ethical
processes and practices strategically to achieve good short-term,
mid-term and long-term goals.[^30]

The cellular node of communalism is the community assembly. Assemblies
in harmony with communalism are community assemblies rooted in form and
content of direct democracy, non-hierarchy, free association, direct
action and mutual aid. Community assemblies are needed for
self-management to exist on community scale. They are places for
dialogue and collective decision making about how to meet needs, solve
social problems, oppose domination, transform society and develop
collective actions and projects to do the above. Self-managed community
assemblies have embedded participatory councils, committees, working
groups and rotating delegate roles to implement specific decisions
within bounds of overall decisions, policies, mandates and protocols
decided by community assemblies. Community assemblies can co-federate to
develop inter-communal mutual aid and commons, direct action,
coordination and decision making. In such co-federal arrangements,
delegates are sent back and forth between co-federal councils and
community assemblies where policy making power stays at lowest level in
hands of community assemblies and participants directly.[^31]

Community assemblies in harmony with communalism have shared processes
and practices for political form and content that at least include
direct democracy, free association, non-hierarchy, communal
self-governance, co-federalism, mutual aid and direct action. Direct
democracy, as in direct collective decision making, is essential for
collective freedom. Direct democracy within free association of persons,
without ruling classes and without hierarchical relations, makes it so
form and content of assemblies are not instrumentalized towards
arbitrarily limiting freedoms of persons. Communal self governance is
needed for self-management to exist on every scale and to prevent
privatization of power over and above communities. Co-federalism allows
for inter-collective decision making and cooperation between community
assemblies in a way where all policy making power is held by community
assemblies and participants thereof directly. Mutual aid is needed for
multi-directional cooperation and action to meet needs of people.
Oppositional direct action against hierarchy and domination is needed to
oppose hierarchical rule and meet needs of people through such
opposition.[^32]

The strategy of communalism consists of developing dual power against
capitalism, statecraft and hierarchy more broadly by using communalist
means, structures and processes to develop communalist ends. Communalism
involves oppositional politics - opposing hierarchies via direct action
through self-managed means. Another dimension is reconstructive politics
and mutual aid - meeting needs of social movements and people more
broadly through horizontal communal organizations, embedded councils,
committees, working groups, common infrastructure and pooling skills,
tools, needs, abilities and resources on various scales. Community
assemblies and embedded councils can develop oppositional and
reconstructive politics at points of reproduction, production,
distribution, extraction, consumption and community life.[^33]

As community assemblies start developing across different blocks,
neighborhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions, they can work on
joint actions and projects as well as form more formal and continuous
co-federal structures of community assemblies on various scales.
Community assemblies rooted in communalist practices aim towards
democratizing and communalizing power, meeting people's needs,
coordinating direct action against various hierarchical powers, while
developing the commons and horizontal governance structures to replace
hierarchical economics and governance structures before, during and
after revolutionary moments. As community assemblies multiply and
coordinate on joint actions and projects, they can gain sufficient
capacity, organizational virtues, collective wisdom, experience,
momentum and legitimacy to contest local and regional hierarchical
governments, expropriate hierarchical infrastructure and institute
community and inter-community self-management as new form of politics
and economics.[^34]

## Types of People's Assemblies

Within organizing traditions, People's Assemblies break down into three
essential types:

**United Front or Alliance based Assembly** - This type of Assembly is
typically a democratic forum populated and driven by formally organized
entities - political parties, unions, churches, civic organizations -
that mobilize their members to participate in broad open decision making
sessions with members from other organizations. What makes this
different from a typical alliance or coalition is that organizations and
their leaders do not make decisions on behalf of their members in these
spaces - members make decisions as individuals within general body. Main
limitation is that they tend to remain "top heavy". Various
organizational leaders often do not disseminate adequate information
about meetings or inform their members about decisions and activities of
Assembly. Many organizations do not have consolidated members or base
they can turn out, instead being legitimated by their history, social
position or charisma of their leadership.

**Constituent Assembly** - This type of Assembly is a representative
body, not a direct democratic body of people in their totality. This
type of Assembly is dependent on mass outreach but is structured,
intentionally or unintentionally, to accommodate material limitations
(having to work, deal with childcare) and social limitations (interest,
access to information, political and ideological differences) of people.
Challenge with this type of Assembly is that if it does not continue to
work to bring in new people, particularly youth, and struggle
politically to be mass in its character, then it tends to become overly
bureaucratic and stagnant over time.

**Mass Assembly** - The Mass Assembly is the broadest example of
people's democracy. It normally emerges during times of acute crisis,
when there are profound ruptures in society. These types of Assemblies
are typically all-consuming, short-lived entities. Their greatest
weakness is that they typically demand those engaged to give all of
their time and energy to engagement of crisis, which over time is not
sustainable, as people eventually have to tend to their daily needs in
order to sustain themselves, their families and communities.[^35]

## Decision Making Across Assemblies

The key problem in building a horizontal, nonhierarchical social order
based on participatory, direct democracy has never been how to do this
on the local level in one town meeting, workers council or village
assembly, but how to make decisions across such assemblies. Direct
democracy is frequently dismissed precisely because people believe that
it cannot work in larger territories. Until we solve the problem of
directly democratic decision making across territories we cannot
establish a free society.

Anarchists have long deluded themselves with the idea of federation that
they have solved the thorny problem of how they can have both direct
democracy and large-scale organization at the same time. Federation
creates a hierarchy by using delegates to form smaller and smaller
decision-making units, further and further removed from the
neighborhood. To make it more palatable, this idea is garnished with
three illusions: mandated delegates, instant recall and separation of
policymaking from administration.

The notion of mandated delegate is a mirage because as soon as a meeting
convenes, everything is open. Discussion of issues redefines those
issues. Sometimes change of only one word in a proposal can completely
alter the proposal's meaning and impact. There is no way delegates can
avoid exercising their own judgment on issues once discussion gets under
way, no matter how detailed their instructions ahead of time. The idea
of instant recall is also an illusion. For recall to work, people back
home would have to be following discussion as closely as if they were
there themselves. Even if everyone back home were watching conference
live on television, in order to exercise recall they would have to
convene themselves in their neighborhood assemblies and debate whether
or not a delegate had deviated from mandate far enough to warrant
recall. Similarly, idea of separation between policy making and
administration does not make sense. Anyone who has worked on a project
knows that all kinds of decisions have to be made constantly. It can be
the most mundane decision and yet have profound policy
implications.[^36]

There are two ways to avoid electing representatives altogether. First,
we could discuss issues in our assemblies but then tally individual
votes across assemblies. This is improvement over parliamentary
democracy in that people are voting on actual issues and are personally
involved in face-to-face discussion and debate, with votes taken right
there in assembly but tallied across assemblies. This procedure is
compatible with direct democracy and might be used in emergencies
provided a proposal can be floated which can be voted up or down.
Drawbacks though are that procedure would require votes be tallied
individually and that some principle of majority rule be used. This
option is closed off if our assemblies are using consensus
decision-making procedures, where votes are not tallied by individuals.

The second way involves a back and forth negotiating process: Proposals
that involve two or more assemblies will first be discussed and decided
upon in local assembly, using consensus process. Then negotiators from
each assembly involved will confer to work out differences and prepare
general agreement, which will then be returned for ratification by local
assemblies. This back and forth process will continue until all
assemblies involved are satisfied with the decision. A key concept here
is ratification. Decision making is kept firmly on local level. Any
decisions about matters outside local area must be based on ratification
by local assemblies, and this can only be accomplished through process
of negotiation. This may take time, but this is the time we need and
steps we need to go through to make directly democratic decisions.[^37]

## Revolutionary Potential

People's Assemblies have been and are used to revolutionize people's
daily lives, change balance of power in societies and in some instances
have toppled governments and ushered in revolutionary change. During
periods of stability within capitalist-imperialist nation-state system
when markets and government are able to project and maintain status quo
operations, an Assembly can push for various positional reforms and low
to mid-level autonomous projects, including things like advancing policy
reform campaigns or building self-reliant oriented cooperatives.

During periods of progressive or radical upsurge, an Assembly can push
for structural reforms and engage in mid-to scalable autonomous
projects. During pre-revolutionary periods, an Assembly can function as
genuine dual power and assume many of functions of government. During
revolutionary periods, an Assembly can effectively become the government
and assume control over basic processes and mechanisms of production.
During periods of retreat, an Assembly must defend people and leadership
that has emerged, fight to maintain as many gains as possible and
prepare for next upsurge.[^38]

The practice of popular assemblies demonstrates that ordinary people can
manage their own affairs without bosses, politicians or bureaucrats.
When properly organized and coordinated, assemblies show that direct
democracy can work not just in small groups but across entire regions.
They provide glimpse of how a free society could organize itself and are
important to anyone seeking to change society in an anarchistic
direction. The challenge remains to build assemblies that can sustain
themselves beyond moments of crisis, that can develop the organizational
capacity and revolutionary consciousness necessary to not just resist
exploitation and domination but to abolish it entirely and build a new
world based on mutual aid, voluntary cooperation and true freedom.
