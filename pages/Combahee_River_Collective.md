Formed in 1974, the
<a href="Wikipedia:Combahee_River_Collective" class="wikilink"
title="Combahee River Collective">Combahee River Collective</a> (CRC)
was comprised of black women who advanced a feminist, socialist,
anti-racist, anti-authoritarian analysis. They employed the terms
"interlocking oppression" and "identity politics" which have become
major influences on the Left. An intersectional black feminist group,
the CRC formed at a time when many feminists did not want to work on
black people's issues, and many black-led groups did not want to
campaign on women's issues (or even opposed reproductive health rights
"on the basis that abortion was genocide for Black people.") They were
named after Harriet Tubman's 1853 raid on South Carolina's Combahee
River. Tubman's raid liberated 750 enslaved people.[^1]

In 1977, the CRC published "The Combahee River Collective Statement." It
committed to horizontal organization: "We believe in collective process
and a nonhierarchical distribution of power within our own group and in
our vision of a revolutionary society."[^2] The statement clarified that
the CRC worked on projects related to "sterilization abuse, abortion
rights, battered women, rape and health care."[^3] The CRC argued that
oppressions are interlocking and that liberating people with
intersecting oppressions would amount to dismantling all oppression: "If
Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be
free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the
systems of oppression."[^4] The statement critiqued orthodox Marxism's
sole preoccupation with class relations. While the CRC identified as
"socialist" and "in essential agreement with Marx's theory," they
rejected class reductionism: "We are not convinced, however, that a
socialist revolution that is not also feminist and antiracist will
guarantee our liberation."[^5]
