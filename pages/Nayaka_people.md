The Nayaka are an egalitarian foraging people in South India.

# Culture

"The communnity is egalitarian," reports anthropologist Nurit
Bird-David.[^1]

The Nayaka consider each other, and even outside visitors, to be kin,
and they address each other in kinship terms such as "my big-uncle" or
"my sister-in-law."[^2]

A couple who sleeps together and shares foraging duties and domestic
chores eventually becomes recognized as married, without a marriage
ceremony. A married couple and their children live together, although
sometimes newly weds temporarily live with the bride's family.[^3]

# Economy

Sharing is central to Nayaka culture. There's a strong expectation that
a Nayaka share food with all present. If a Nayaka asks another for
something, giving it is the norm.[^4]

The Nayaka diet is mainly based on foraged yams, nuts, honey, and fish,
along with purchased or bartererd rice. Hunting is rare, but game
include deer, lizards and pigs.[^5]

# Environment

The Nayaka cosmovision is traditionally animistic and reveres the
naturalistic *devaru* (spirits) and ancestors that inhabit the forest.
The religion has also incorporated minor deities of Hindu neighbors.[^6]
