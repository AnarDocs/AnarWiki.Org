# Anarchist Response to Lenin's State and Revolution

**State and Revolution** (1917) represents Vladimir Lenin's most
libertarian work and has generated significant anarchist commentary,
both acknowledging its radical departure from Second International
reformism and critiquing its fundamental theoretical and practical
failures. Written during the summer of 1917, the work sought to reclaim
what Lenin saw as Marx's revolutionary vision from the opportunism of
Social Democracy, drawing heavily on Marx's writings about the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a>.

## Initial Reception and Libertarian Elements

Anarchists have long noted that much of *State and Revolution*
articulates positions essentially identical to anarchism. The work
advocates for the smashing of the bourgeois state machine, the
replacement of standing armies with popular militias, the substitution
of parliamentary bodies with directly democratic workers' councils, the
immediate recallability of all delegates, and payment of officials at
workers' wages. As one anarchist analysis noted, "No one can deny that
Lenin's 'State and Revolution' is a classic, if flawed, work. Much that
passes for 'Marxism' in it is pure anarchism."[^1]

These elements represented a significant break from the parliamentary
road advocated by Second International Marxism. Lenin emphasized that
"the way out of parliamentarism is not, of course, the abolition of
representative institutions and the elective principle, but the
conversion of the representative institutions from talking shops into
'working' bodies."[^2] This echoed longstanding anarchist critiques of
bourgeois democracy.

Some anarchists initially welcomed aspects of the work. The emphasis on
smashing the state machine rather than simply capturing it, the focus on
the Paris Commune as a model, and the insistence that the revolutionary
state must begin withering away immediately all seemed to move Lenin
closer to anarchist positions.

## The Central Paradox

However, anarchist critics identified a fundamental paradox at the heart
of Lenin's argument. While proclaiming the goal of a stateless society,
the practical thrust of the work emphasized building a strong,
centralized state apparatus. As Iain McKay observed, Lenin "argued that
the dictatorship of the proletariat would soon become the 'dictatorship
over the proletariat.'"[^3]

The theory of the "withering away of the state" meant that
revolutionaries need not concern themselves with actively dismantling
state power—this would happen automatically through historical
processes. The immediate task was instead to construct a powerful new
state. As one critical analysis noted: "The practical application of
this theory, it seems to me, is that the key job of revolutionaries
after a successful proletarian revolution is not to do away with the
state, but to build a new one. Moreover, in order to suppress the
bourgeoisie and the other exploiters most efficiently, this state should
be as strong and all-embracing as possible."[^4]

This represented a crucial difference from anarchism. Where anarchists
argued that the state is "marked by certain structures which allow it to
do its task" and that "the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' would soon
become the dictatorship over the proletariat,"[^5] Lenin assumed a
centralized state could remain a tool of the working class.

## Confusion of State and Social Organization

Anarchists argued that Lenin fundamentally confused the state as a
specific form of social organization with social organization in
general. "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> had long argued that the state's defining
characteristics—hierarchical centralization, top-down command,
separation of decision-making from those affected by decisions—made it
inherently a tool of minority rule.

As Kropotkin noted, the state is "an organisation of hierarchical
centralisation" and is "necessarily hierarchical, authoritarian – or it
ceases to be the State."[^6] The centralized structure did not appear by
accident but developed specifically to enable minority class rule. Lenin
missed that "hierarchical and centralised structures are needed for a
minority to rule. They exclude the masses from participation in social
life."[^7]

Lenin argued that "we cannot imagine democracy, even proletarian
democracy, without representative institutions," but anarchists
countered that he "confuses social organisation with the State and
misses the point by saying" this, since "while any organisation requires
delegates to co-ordinate decisions it is a mistake to confuse this with
representative – and so centralised – government."[^8] The question was
whether elected bodies focused on specific tasks at appropriate levels
(federalism) or covered all matters at the center (the state).

## The Party Question

A striking omission in *State and Revolution* is any discussion of the
role of the revolutionary party. Given that Lenin spent his entire
political life building such a party and considered it essential for
socialist consciousness, this absence was telling. Anarchists argued
this revealed Lenin's true conception: either the party would continue
to monopolize political decision-making, or politics itself would be
transcended, leaving only administration.

As McKay noted, "Lenin never grasped Marx's discussion of alienated
labor and fetishism. The emancipatory power of the proletariat comes
from the fact that the working class exists as the negation of property,
of exploitation."[^9] Instead, Lenin located revolutionary potential in
the proletariat's role in large-scale production, leading him to
envision socialism as the management of existing production relations by
the state rather than their abolition.

This connected to Lenin's conception of consciousness derived from *What
is to be Done?*—that revolutionary consciousness comes from outside the
working class, from the party of bourgeois intellectuals. Despite the
seemingly libertarian rhetoric of *State and Revolution*, "Lenin
continues to view the development of class-consciousness in a mechanical
way that assumes the party as a necessary catalyst and embodiment of
class-consciousness."[^10] By educating the workers' party, "Marxism
educates the vanguard of the proletariat, capable of assuming power and
leading the whole people to socialism."[^11]

## State Capitalism in Embryo

Anarchists identified several passages revealing Lenin's essentially
state capitalist vision:

**The Postal System Model**: Lenin wrote admiringly that "at the present
the postal service is a business organized on the lines of
state-capitalist monopoly" and proposed to "organize the whole economy
on the lines of the postal service." The workers would simply take over
this "splendidly-equipped mechanism" with its hierarchical structure
intact, merely replacing bourgeois control with workers' control.[^12]

Reading this passage, one anarchist critic found it "truly frightening.
Lenin wanted to organize all society along the lines of the German
postal system, replete with bourgeois technicians, foremen, etc., under
the illusion that this structure could be effectively controlled by the
workers."[^13]

**The Single Factory**: "The whole of society will have become a single
office and a single factory, with equality of labour and pay," Lenin
wrote.[^14] While presenting this as merely a transitional stage,
anarchists noted it revealed Lenin's impoverished vision of
socialism—not the free association of producers, but a regimented
industrial army.

**Wage Labour Continues**: Lenin explicitly stated that under
"socialism" (the first phase of communism), "all citizens are
transformed into hired employees of the state, which consists of the
armed workers."[^15] This meant wage labour would continue, with the
state as collective employer. As Kropotkin had warned, turning
individual property into common property under state management "would
only increase the powers of bureaucracy and capitalism" and "create a
new instrument of tyranny."[^16]

## Misreading Marx

Anarchists argued Lenin fundamentally misread Marx's *Critique of the
Gotha Programme*. Where Marx discussed a transition period between
capitalism and communism, Lenin confused this revolutionary period with
the first stage of communism itself. Marx's two phases of communism both
assumed the end of the state, wage labour, and commodity production.
Lenin, however, described a "first phase" that retained all these
features.

As McKay demonstrated, "Lenin completely misunderstands Marx's
discussion of two stages of communism. The first phase of communism
already assumes the end of money and the wage relation. It assumes the
end of the state and of capitalist relations of production."[^17] Both
phases depended on what Marx called "the free association of producers,"
which was entirely absent from Lenin's vision.

Marx had used the term "dictatorship of the proletariat" in the same way
he referred to all capitalist states as the "dictatorship of the
bourgeoisie"—as the social dictatorship of a class, not a specific state
form. Lenin, however, understood it as "a particularly dictatorial type
of state, whose task is the repression of the capitalist class after the
revolution."[^18]

## Theory versus Practice

The most damning anarchist criticism was that Bolshevik practice
revealed the bankruptcy of Lenin's theory. While *State and Revolution*
promised working-class democracy, Bolshevik rule delivered party
dictatorship:

- **Soviet Democracy Destroyed**: Within months of October 1917, the
  Bolsheviks were disbanding soviets that elected non-Bolshevik
  majorities, postponing elections, and packing soviets with appointed
  representatives from organizations they controlled. As early as spring
  1918, "the Bolsheviks felt constrained to dissolve Soviets or prevent
  re-elections where Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries had gained
  majorities."[^19]

<!-- -->

- **Workers' Control Eliminated**: Factory committees were subordinated
  to state-controlled trade unions. By April 1918, Lenin demanded
  "obedience, and unquestioning obedience at that, during work to the
  one-man decisions of Soviet directors, of the dictators elected or
  appointed by Soviet institutions, vested with dictatorial
  powers."[^20] Workers' self-management was replaced with appointed
  managers, often former Tsarist industrialists.

<!-- -->

- **Armed Bodies Recreated**: Rather than "armed workers," the
  Bolsheviks created the Cheka (political police) and a hierarchical Red
  Army with appointed officers. These became instruments for repressing
  worker strikes and peasant revolts.

<!-- -->

- **Bureaucracy Expanded**: Instead of officials paid workers' wages
  subject to recall, a vast bureaucracy emerged. "By August 1918 nearly
  a third of Moscow's working population were employed in offices."[^21]
  This bureaucracy "grew by leaps and bounds" as the "centralistic,
  bureaucratic and military organization" expanded.[^22]

These developments occurred before the Civil War began in late May 1918,
undermining the standard Leninist excuse that "objective conditions"
caused the degeneration. As McKay documented, "the elimination of
soviet, workplace and military democracy, the attacks on opposition
groups as well as basic civil liberties occurred before it began."[^23]

## Defense of Party Dictatorship

By the early 1920s, leading Bolsheviks openly defended what *State and
Revolution* had supposedly opposed. Lenin argued that "revolutionary
coercion is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable
elements among the masses themselves."[^24]
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a> declared that the party was "obliged to maintain its
dictatorship, regardless of temporary wavering even in the working
classes" because it was "entitled to assert its dictatorship even if
that dictatorship temporarily clashed with the passing moods of the
workers' democracy."[^25]

This was not a temporary aberration. Trotsky repeated in 1937 that "the
revolutionary party (vanguard) which renounces its own dictatorship
surrenders the masses to the counter-revolution."[^26] The workers
needed state power precisely because of their "insufficient cultural
level" and "heterogeneity"—in other words, because they could not govern
themselves. As Bakunin had predicted, this meant "the dictatorship of
the proletariat is at the same time the dictatorship of the Communist
Party."[^27]

## The Makhnovist Alternative

Anarchists pointed to the "<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine as
demonstrating that alternatives were possible under the same difficult
conditions. The Makhnovists "promoted workers' and peasants' control.
They practised freedom of speech and assembly. They called democratic
soviet congresses. The army was democratic. They did everything Lenin
promised but failed to deliver."[^28] That the Bolsheviks eventually
betrayed and crushed this movement showed that ideology, not objective
conditions, determined Bolshevik authoritarianism.

## Contemporary Anarchist Assessment

Modern anarchist analysis views *State and Revolution* as revealing the
fundamental incompatibility between Marxist statism and genuine
socialism. While the work's libertarian rhetoric initially attracted
many revolutionaries, its underlying assumptions guaranteed the
reproduction of class society in new forms.

The book demonstrates that "ideas matter – particularly the ideas of
those at the highest levels of the State."[^29] Lenin's privileging of
centralization, his faith in bourgeois technology and management, his
reduction of socialism to state ownership, and his concept of the party
as bearer of consciousness all shaped Bolshevik practice. As
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> concluded after witnessing the results, "the Russian
Revolution shows that it was not a case of the State and Revolution but
rather the State or Revolution."[^30]

The failure was not accidental but flowed from treating the state as a
neutral tool rather than as a specific social relation embodying
hierarchical power. As one anarchist assessment concluded: "The issue is
simple. Either you have a participatory federation of directly
democratic workplace and community assemblies (anarchism) or you have a
state with party power in the name of the masses (Bolshevism). The
fundamental flaw in Leninism is that it confuses the two and ensures the
result anarchists predicted so accurately."[^31]

Anarchists argue that genuine socialism requires not the conquest of
state power but its abolition—the creation of federalist, self-managed,
bottom-up social organization based on the free association of
producers. The Russian experience proved that "no state is ever a
generic state" and that centralized, hierarchical structures inevitably
reproduce class domination regardless of their proclaimed purposes.[^32]
