"Philo of Alexandria, writing around the time of Christ, says of the
Essenes: 'not a single slave is to be found among them, but all are
free, exchanging services with each other, and they denounce the owners
of slaves, not merely for their injustice in outraging the law of
equality, but also for their impiety in annulling the statute of nature'
(Quod omnis probus liber sit 79)"[^1]

The Essenes were a communistic Jewish order in ancient Palestine and
Syria from 150 BCE until the destruction of Jerusalem's Second Temple in
66 CE. The first-century CE historian Josephus wrote that the Essenes
had 4,000 members. They worked as farmers and artisans and owned no
slaves. The Essenes lived in common dwellings, ate their meals together,
and shared almost all possessions. They rejected animal sacrifices and
some members may have been vegetarian.

The *Jewish Encyclopedia*, in addition to repeatedly referring to the
Essenes' "communism," summarizes the historian Philo's description of
them: "he speaks of only four thousand Essenes, who lived as farmers and
artisans apart from the cities and in a perfect state of communism, and
who condemned slavery, avoided sacrifice, abstained from swearing,
strove for holiness, and were particularly scrupulous regarding the
Sabbath, which day was devoted to the reading and allegorical
interpretation of the Law."[^2]

# Culture

Essenes were of working-class origin, and Kautsky contends that this
economic basis influenced some of their beliefs. The Essenes, being
poorer and having to work to survive, rejected free will and believed
all events were predetermined. By contrast, the priestly Saudduces,
relatively unconstrained by economic necessity, rejected fate
altogether. The Pharisees, an elite order with broad popular support,
believed in a mixture of fate and free will.[^3]

Most but not all Essenes rejected contact with women. In this respect,
they differed from the coeducational Egyptian Jewish order of the
Therapeutae, who may have influenced the Essenes.[^4]

# Economy

Essenes had jobs outside their social organization, but they brought
home all wages to share in common. Most Essenes worked as farmers and
others worked as craftsmen. None were allowed to produce weapons or
luxury items.[^5] Some members were "chiefs" who apparently had a degree
of authority. For instance, a chief needed to consent before an Essen
could give a gift to a friend or a relative.

Essenes shared almost all possessions, as Philo explained: "Not only
food but clothing as well is in common with them. For there are heavy
cloaks prepared for the winter and light outer garments for summer so
that every man may make use of them as he will. For what one has counts
as the property of all, and what all of them have counts as
everyman's."[^6]

# Environment

The Essenes did not participate in the Hebrew Temple's sacrifices[^7]
and made vegetable sacrifices instead.[^8]

At least some of the Essenes appear to have been vegetarian.[^9] Jewish
culinary historian Paola Gavin describes the Essenes:

> "They were an ancient, Jewish sect living in Judaea between the second
> century BC and the first century AD, who were strict vegetarians. The
> Essenes recommended eating a simple diet of fresh fruit, vegetables,
> barley, wheat, almonds, milk and honey – which they claimed would keep
> you healthy and lengthen your life."[^10]

# Influence

Some scholars and theologians say Jesus was influenced by the Essenes or
was even a member of the movement.
