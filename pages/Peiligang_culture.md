In China's Henan province, there are about 100 known sites from the
ancient Peiligang culture from about 7000 to 5000 BCE. Their arrangement
suggests political decentralization, and Peiligang culture was "in
general, an egalitarian society" according to archaeologist Li Liu.[^1]
People of the Peiligang culture farmed millet and rice and domesticated
pigs, dogs, and possibly chicken.[^2]

At the Jiahu and Shuiquan sites, the differences in grave goods were not
large enough to indicate long-term economic privilege. The more
prestigious graves were not spatially separated from other graves, and
there is no clear pattern of men getting more grave goods than women or
vice versa.[^3] Most grave goods were not gender-specific, in contrast
to burials in the stratified Dawenkou and Longshan cultures where most
grave goods were gender-specific.[^4]

Houses were grouped into clusters, probably based on kinship. Since
burials occurred right next to houses, it is likely that ancestors
played an important role in everyday life.[^5]
