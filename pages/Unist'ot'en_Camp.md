The **Unist'ot'en** ("People of the Headwater") are one of five clans of
the indigenous Wet'suwet'en people of British Columbia in Canada. The
Unist'ot'en were the first of the clans to live on the territory, and
they autonomously control two thirds of the total Wet'suwet'en land.
Through directly-democratic processes, they have decided to resist all
pipeline construction on their territory, and since 2010 they have
organized action camps and a long-running blockade against oil and gas
companies, representing a practical example of

"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a>, and "<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a>.

## Anarchist Governance Structures

The Unist'ot'en clan makes decisions in a Feast Hall, where all members
gather and engage in a process that "resembles a consensus approach"
according to "Standing on the Land to Stand Up Against Pipelines," a
report collectively written by anonymous indigenous and non-indigenous
people who visited the camp in 2012 and 2013.[^1] Unist'ot'en members
consider Feast Hall decisions "the ultimate authority of the land,"
according to this report.[^2] In addition, the Unist'ot'en have a
hereditary Chief who acts as the clan spokesperson.

Significantly, although Canada has imposed a hierarchical Band Council
system, many residents say that the Band Council only has "limited
authority," which does not include the power to allow pipelines into the
territory.[^3] This rejection of colonial hierarchical impositions in
favor of traditional consensus-based governance represents a clear
example of anarchist principles in practice. The camp was established by
hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation who opposed several
elected Wet'suwet'en band councils that signed agreements with pipeline
companies, demonstrating the conflict between imposed colonial
governance structures and traditional non-hierarchical decision-making
processes.[^4]

## Direct Action and Resistance

After building a clan cabin directly on the route of the proposed
Enbridge Northern Gateway and Pacific Trail pipelines in 2010, the
Unist'ot'en hosted three action camps. Then, they and supporters
expanded the cabin into a permanent blockade camp in the winter of
2012.[^5] At the exact points where pipelines were intended to cross the
Unist'ot'en Territory of Talbits Kwah, a traditional pithouse and
permaculture garden were built, demonstrating the camp's prefigurative
approach to resistance.

A single-lane bridge is the only way to access Unist'ot'en territory,
and those camp members on a "bridge duty" shift are ready to rush to the
bridge to put their bodies in the way of invaders from energy companies
and law enforcement.[^6] Several kilometres east of the camp, the
Wet'suwet'en set up a checkpoint on the Morice River Forest Services
Road, controlling access to the area and blocking the pipeline project
through direct action tactics.

The camp was constructed as a means to block the development of numerous
pipelines and other projects deemed harmful to the land, including
pipelines from
"<a   href="Enbridge.md" class="wikilink" title="Enbridge">"Enbridge</a>, the
Pacific Trails Pipeline ("<a   href="Chevron_Corporation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Chevron">"Chevron</a>), as well as seven proposed pipelines from
the Alberta Oil Sands and LNG from the Horn River Basin Projects in the
Peace River Region.

In 2015, the Unist'ot'en released a declaration which stated: "The
Unist'ot'en settlement camp is not a protest or a demonstration. Our
clan is occupying and using our traditional territory as it has for
centuries. Our free, prior, and informed consent protocol is in place at
the entrance of our territory as an expression of our jurisdiction and
our inherent right to both give and refuse consent and entry into our
territory."[^7][^8]

## Responsibilities Over Rights

The authors of "Standing on the Land" report that Unist'ot'en tradition
celebrates responsibilities rather than rights. Regarding rights as a
colonial invention rooted in power-over, Unist'ot'en consider
responsibilities, the foundation of the blockade, to be "guided by a
power-with relationship to land" and "something that comes from the
Creator through natural law."[^9] This philosophy directly challenges
liberal rights-based frameworks and instead emphasizes collective
responsibility and relationship to the land, resonating with anarchist
critiques of abstract rights divorced from material conditions and
relationships.

## Prefigurative Community

The journalist Sam Bliss describes the camp as a "sort of utopian
project":

> Really, the camp is a sort of utopian project. It embodies the
> possibility of a world where citizens wake up in the morning and do
> the work they love, whatever that may be, toward goals they believe
> in, and then share meals and good times and a common cause. The
> blockade community exists apart from bosses and wages and expert
> decision-making committees.[^10]

This description highlights the camp's prefigurative nature - it
demonstrates anarchist principles by creating a community based on
voluntary cooperation, meaningful work, and consensus decision-making,
while actively resisting capitalist social relations.

## Healing and Mutual Aid

The camp is the site of activities related to healing and learning.
Construction of a healing centre began in 2015.[^11] The healing centre
welcomes people to reconnect with the land, learn cultural practices,
and recover from health issues such as substance abuse, using
traditional Indigenous methods.[^12] According to the traditional
beliefs of the Wet'suwet'en people, healing can come from being
connected to the land and that the impacts of colonialism, including
living away from traditional territories, are harmful.[^13] A youth camp
provides opportunities for young people to learn and practice their
culture.[^14]

This emphasis on collective healing, cultural transmission, and mutual
support demonstrates anarchist principles of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
and community care outside of state and capitalist institutions.

## State Repression and Solidarity

In 2018, TC Energy was granted an injunction to remove the checkpoint
and have complete access to the pipeline project construction. In
January 2019, the
"<a   href="Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police.md" class="wikilink"
title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">"Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>
(RCMP) entered the territory to enforce the court injunction and allow
workers from the Coastal GasLink pipeline project temporary access to
the area. The RCMP arrested 14 people on January 8 at the
checkpoint.[^15][^16]

In December 2019, the injunction was re-instated. The RCMP returned to
the area in 2020 and arrests began again as the RCMP cleared the Morice
Forest Service Road, including the arrests of Wet'suwet'en matriarchs.
According to the Unist'ot'en Camp website:

> They were arrested in the middle of a ceremony to honour the
> ancestors. Police tore down the red dresses that were hung to hold the
> spirits of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two
> spirit people. They extinguished \[their\] sacred fire. \[They\] have
> had enough. Enough dialogue, discussion, negotiation at the barrel of
> a gun. Canada comes to colonize. Reconciliation is dead. It is time to
> fight for \[their\] land, \[their\] lives, \[their\] children,
> \[their\] future. Revolution lives.[^17]

The arrests sparked widespread protests in British Columbia and across
Canada in support of the Wet'suwet'en, demonstrating the power of
"<a   href="solidarity.md" class="wikilink" title="solidarity">"solidarity</a>
and networked resistance to state violence and corporate
extraction.[^18]

Solidarity statements supporting the preservation of the Unist'ot'en
Camp were issued by organizations and institutions such as:
"<a   href="OCAD_University.md" class="wikilink" title="OCAD University">"OCAD
University</a>,[^19] the British Columbia Teachers' Federation,[^20] and
Ryerson University School of Social Work.[^21]

## Victory and Ongoing Struggle

On 1 December 2016, the Unist'ot'en Camp posted on *Facebook*,
celebrating the Canadian government's decision to cancel the Northern
Gateway Pipeline:

> It wasn't the petitions. It wasn't the ENGO \[environmental
> non-governmental organization\] campaigns. It was the Grassroots
> Hereditary system, backed by thousands of years of proven Decision
> Making Authority, that killed this snake.[^22]

This statement emphasizes the effectiveness of direct action and
traditional non-hierarchical decision-making over reformist tactics like
petitions and NGO campaigns. The victory was offset, however, since
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on the same day that he
was approving two more pipelines.[^23]

## Anarchist Analysis

The Unist'ot'en Camp represents a powerful example of anarchist
principles in practice:
"<a   href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">"consensus decision-making</a>,
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a>, rejection of imposed hierarchical authority,
"<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>,
and resistance to state and corporate power. The conflict between the
hereditary chiefs using traditional consensus-based governance and the
imposed colonial Band Council system demonstrates the fundamental
incompatibility between anarchist organizing principles and
state-imposed hierarchies.

The camp's emphasis on responsibilities over rights challenges liberal
political theory and resonates with anarchist critiques of abstract
rights divorced from community relationships and material conditions.
The creation of a healing centre and youth camp demonstrates the
anarchist principle of building alternative institutions and practices
while resisting dominant power structures.

The state's violent response to the camp - including multiple RCMP
raids, arrests during ceremonies, and the destruction of sacred sites -
reveals the inherent violence of the colonial state when confronted with
autonomous communities that reject its authority. The widespread
solidarity protests that followed demonstrate the potential for
networked resistance and the connections between indigenous sovereignty
struggles and broader anti-capitalist, anti-colonial, and anarchist
movements.
