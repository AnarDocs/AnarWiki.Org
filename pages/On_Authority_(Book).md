# Anarchist Response to "On Authority"

## Overview

Friedrich Engels' essay "On Authority" (1872) has been wielded by
Marxists for over 150 years as a supposed refutation of anarchism.
Written during the conflicts within the First International between
Marx-Engels and Bakunin, the essay argues that anarchists' opposition to
authority is naive and contradictory, as all forms of organization and
revolutionary action necessarily involve "authority."[^1]

However, anarchists have consistently demonstrated that Engels' essay
fundamentally misrepresents anarchist theory by conflating distinct
concepts, ignoring anarchist analyses of different types of authority,
and using circular definitions that render meaningful discussion
impossible. Far from refuting anarchism, "On Authority" reveals Engels'
failure to engage seriously with anarchist ideas as they actually
existed.

## The Definitional Problem

### Engels' Confusion of Terms

Engels defines authority as "the imposition of the will of another upon
ours" and argues this is "in the sense in which the word is used here"
by anarchists.[^2] However, this reveals the fundamental flaw in his
argument: Engels did not understand what anarchists actually meant by
authority.

Anarchists like <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> were explicit in
distinguishing different types of authority. Bakunin differentiated
between:

- **Hierarchical authority** - the domination of some people over
  others, backed by coercive power
- **Rational/expert authority** - knowledge and expertise that people
  voluntarily choose to respect
- **Natural authority** - the inevitable constraints of physical reality
  and natural laws

Bakunin explicitly stated: "Does it follow that I reject all authority?
Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, I refer to the
authority of the bootmaker... But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the
architect nor the scientist to impose his authority upon me. I listen to
them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence,
their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable
right of criticism and censure."[^3]

This shows that when anarchists spoke of opposing "authority," they
specifically meant hierarchical domination backed by coercive force -
what Bakunin called "the principle of authority." They did not oppose
voluntary cooperation, technical coordination, or following expert
advice.[^4]

### The Conflation of Cooperation with Coercion

Engels' central error is conflating fundamentally different social
relationships under the single term "authority":

- Voluntary agreement between equals
- Hierarchical command backed by force
- Technical coordination in collective work
- Violent oppression
- Resistance to oppression

By defining all of these as "authority," Engels makes the word
meaningless for political analysis. As one anarchist critic notes, "You
might as well go so far as to say that men are obedient to the will of
their hunger when they eat, or obedient to the mastery of the rain when
they seek shelter."[^5]

## The Factory Example

### Engels' Argument

Engels uses the example of a cotton spinning mill to argue that
anarchist society would still require authority. He claims that because
workers must coordinate their schedules and follow technical procedures,
they are subject to "the authority of the steam, which cares nothing for
individual autonomy."[^6]

### The Anarchist Response

This argument confuses several distinct things:

**Technical Requirements vs. Social Relationships**

Yes, operating machinery requires following certain procedures - this is
a technical fact, not a social relationship of domination. As anarchists
point out, the same technical requirements exist whether the factory is:

- Owned by a capitalist who commands workers
- Self-managed by the workers themselves through collective
  decision-making

Engels treats both situations as equally "authoritarian," ignoring the
fundamental difference in social relationships.[^7]

**The Reality of Worker Autonomy**

Engels claims workers have no autonomy in factories. Yet the
effectiveness of "work-to-rule" strikes proves the opposite. When
workers follow only the exact written rules and procedures, without
using their autonomous judgment to solve problems, factories grind to a
halt. Modern industry actually depends on workers' autonomy and
initiative.[^8]

As David Noble notes, "any production process depends on a host of
informal practices and improvisations that could never be codified."[^9]

**Delegation vs. Power**

Engels ridicules anarchists who distinguish between delegating tasks and
delegating power. But this distinction is crucial:

- A **delegate** is given a specific task by a group, reports back, and
  implements only what the group decides
- An **authority** has power to make decisions for others and enforce
  them

In anarchist organization, delegates to coordinate work schedules or
represent a group in negotiations do not have power over the group -
they execute the group's decisions.[^10]

## The Machine as Despot

### Engels' Contradiction with Marx

Engels claims that the "automatic machinery of a big factory is much
more despotic than the small capitalists" and this despotism exists
"independent of all social organisation."[^11]

This directly contradicts Marx's analysis in Capital, where the
despotism of machinery is explicitly presented as a product of
capitalist social relations, not an inherent property of machinery
itself. Marx describes how under capitalism, workers become "mere living
appendages" of machines, but this is due to alienated labor and the
extraction of surplus value, not the technical nature of machinery.[^12]

Indeed, Engels himself later contradicted his own essay. In Anti-Dühring
(1878), he wrote that socialism "puts an end to the former subjection of
men to their own means of production" and that "productive labour,
instead of being a means of subjugating men, will become a means of
their emancipation."[^13]

If "On Authority" is correct that machinery creates inevitable despotism
"independent of all social organisation," then socialism cannot end the
subjection of workers to their means of production. The two positions
cannot be reconciled.

## Revolutionary Violence

### Engels' Argument

Engels argues that "a revolution is certainly the most authoritarian
thing there is" because it involves one part of the population imposing
its will on another through violence.[^14]

### The Class-Blind Analysis

This argument reveals a stunning absence of class analysis. Engels
describes revolution as simply "one part of the population" imposing on
another, ignoring:

- The ruling class constantly imposes its will on workers through the
  state, police, and economic coercion
- Revolution is the oppressed fighting back against this ongoing
  imposition
- Defending freedom against those who would destroy it is qualitatively
  different from imposing domination

As <a href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> explained: "We recognise
violence only as a means of legitimate self-defence; and if today they
are in favour of violence it is because they maintain that slaves are
always in a state of legitimate defence."[^15]

Engels' logic would mean that slaves fighting their masters are being
"authoritarian" toward the slaveholders. This liberal, class-blind
analysis equates oppression with resistance to oppression.[^16]

### The Organizational Question

Anarchists have never claimed revolutions can occur without organization
or violence. The question is: what kind of organization?

- **Authoritarian organization**: Power concentrated in a hierarchy,
  with leaders commanding followers
- **Libertarian organization**: Horizontal coordination through
  voluntary federation, with instantly recallable delegates who execute
  collective decisions rather than making them

The <a href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a>, <a href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, and other anarchist
experiments demonstrated that revolutionary violence and defense can be
organized through libertarian rather than authoritarian structures.[^17]

## Historical Evidence

### Anarchist Organization in Practice

History has thoroughly refuted Engels' prediction that abolishing
authority would make industry impossible:

**The Paris Commune (1871)**

Despite Engels' claims, the Paris Commune was significantly influenced
by anarchist ideas, including those of Bakunin himself. Industry
continued to function under worker control without capitalist
authority.[^18]

**Revolutionary Catalonia (1936-1937)**

During the <a href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, anarcho-syndicalist
unions organized production across vast sectors of the economy without
bosses or state control. As historian Burnett Bolloten documented,
industries including railways, shipping, manufacturing, utilities, and
agriculture were "confiscated or controlled by workmen's committees"
operating on libertarian principles.[^19]

**The Free Territory (1919-1921)**

The <a href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Free Territory in Ukraine">Free Territory in Ukraine</a>
organized both military defense and economic production on anarchist
principles, with "free working councils" replacing state authority.[^20]

**Workplace Occupations**

Numerous factory occupations and worker cooperatives throughout history
have demonstrated that workers can organize production themselves:

- Italian factory occupations (1920) - 600,000 workers
- Lip watch factory (France, 1973)
- Argentine factory occupations (2000s)
- Ongoing cooperatives like Mondragon[^21]

## The "Changing Names" Objection

Engels mocks anarchists who distinguish between conferring authority and
entrusting a commission, claiming "these gentlemen think that when they
have changed the names of things they have changed the things
themselves."[^22]

This dismissal reveals Engels' bad faith. Anarchists are not arbitrarily
changing labels - they are pointing to material differences in social
relationships:

**Authority (Hierarchical)**

- Power to command others
- Right to make decisions for the group
- Backed by coercive force
- Not immediately recallable
- Creates permanent divisions between rulers and ruled

**Delegation (Libertarian)**

- Specific task assigned by the group
- Executes decisions made collectively
- Voluntary agreement
- Instantly recallable
- Rotates to prevent power concentration[^23]

To claim these are the same because both involve "one person directing
others" is like claiming marriage and slavery are the same because both
involve "two people living together."

## Marxist Defenses

Modern Marxists have attempted to defend Engels through two
contradictory interpretations:

### The "Meaningless Term" Defense

Some argue Engels was not defending a different definition of authority,
but claiming the entire concept is meaningless and should be abandoned
as "metaphysical."[^24]

This interpretation fails because:

- Engels explicitly defined authority at the start of his essay
- He argued that authority would continue to exist in socialism
- He used the concept throughout his own analysis
- He later wrote about "political authority" as distinct from
  administrative functions

If authority is meaningless, why did Engels use it as his central
analytical category?

### The "Scientific vs. Moral" Defense

Others claim anarchists make "moral" objections to authority while
Marxists make "scientific" ones, and that Engels was rejecting moral
analysis in favor of materialism.

This also fails because:

- Anarchists base their opposition to authority on material analysis of
  domination, exploitation, and class relations, not abstract morality
- Distinguishing between voluntary cooperation and coercive hierarchy is
  a material distinction about social relationships
- Engels himself made moral claims, describing the factory as "despotic"
  and revolution as "necessary"
- Claiming to be "beyond morality" while defending certain social
  relations is itself a moral position[^25]

## Harm to Marxism

### Internal Contradictions

Engels' essay creates irreconcilable contradictions within Marxist
theory:

**On Democracy**

Engels and Lenin argued that socialism would "overcome" and "abolish"
the state and democracy. Yet Engels claimed all collective
decision-making involves "subordination" of the minority to the
majority. Lenin tries to resolve this by saying people will become
"accustomed" to social cooperation without subordination - which is
exactly the anarchist position that authority (in the anarchist sense)
can be abolished.[^26]

**On Worker Emancipation**

Marx and Engels consistently argued that socialism would end workers'
subjection to the means of production. "On Authority" claims this
subjection is inevitable and "independent of all social organisation."
The two positions cannot coexist.

### Historical Consequences

Engels' arguments provided ideological justification for
authoritarianism in practice:

**Bolshevik Russia**

Lenin explicitly used Engels' logic to justify:

- Appointing managers with "dictatorial powers" over workers
- Eliminating factory committees
- Demanding "unquestioning subordination" of workers
- Claiming all of this was necessary because of the "technical"
  requirements of production

The result was not socialism but
<a href="state_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a>, with workers remaining
subordinated to a new ruling class of state bureaucrats.[^27]

## Conclusion

"On Authority" fails as a critique of anarchism on every level:

- It misrepresents what anarchists mean by authority
- It conflates fundamentally different social relationships
- It ignores anarchist theory as it actually existed
- It contradicts other works by Marx and Engels
- It has been refuted by historical practice

The essay's persistence in Marxist discourse says more about the
ideological needs of Marxists than about the quality of Engels'
arguments. As one anarchist critic notes, after 150 years, "the
discourse has advanced precisely nowhere" because Engels never engaged
with anarchist ideas in good faith to begin with.[^28]

Anarchists do not oppose all forms of coordination, cooperation, or
organization. We oppose **hierarchical authority** - the domination of
human by human, backed by force, which creates and maintains relations
of exploitation. This is a material distinction with concrete
implications for how we organize both the revolutionary struggle and the
free society we aim to create.

As Bakunin concluded: "We are enemies of all authority because we know
that authority corrupts those who exercise it as much as those who are
compelled to submit to it."[^29]
