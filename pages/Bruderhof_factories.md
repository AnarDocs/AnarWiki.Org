The "<a   href="Wikipedia:Bruderhof_Communities.md" class="wikilink"
title="Bruderhof">Bruderhof</a> (meaning “community of brethren”) are a
network of Christian communist communities that split from the Hutterite
movement. Their website says they have 2,700 members living in
twenty-three communities on four continents.[^1] They live without
private property and with very few personal possessions. The Bruderhof
communally provide meals, basic education, and health care, and they
communally own their cars. When someone needs to pay for something like
tuition for medical school, they draw from communal funds. Although the
Bruderhof society is hierarchical, their factories are not.[^2]

Factory workers come and go whenever they please, and they report to no
boss. "Nor is there any hierarchy within the factory," writes the
ecosocialist Joel Kovel. Factories have managers, but they "have no
particular authority beyond their differentiated task". The factories do
not accumulate wealth beyond what is needed to support the Bruderhof's
anti-consumerist, materially simple lifestyles. Adults and children work
alongside each other. Workers are not paid individually. Instead, all of
the revenue goes to the community.[^3] Incorporated under the names
Rifton Equipment, Community Playthings, and Danthonia Designs, Bruderhof
factories produce learning devices for disabled students, toys,
furniture, and signs.[^4]

Kovel argues that the Bruderhof prove there is no contradiction between
industrial technology and ecological living. The factories use advanced
computers, the communities keep in touch with other over the phone, and
they even own a small aircraft fleet. Nonetheless, they consume very
little, and "if we could somehow figure out a way to get all the people
of the industrialized nations to live so lightly on the earth, there
would be no crisis of anywhere near the present scale to worry
about."[^5]

# Cultural Hierarchies

Kovel wrote in 2007:

Problems have persisted, as a queer radio station reported in 2019:
