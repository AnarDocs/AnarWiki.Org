Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works[^1]:

> The Dissent! Network arose out of the European anti-globalization
> movement to organize major protests against the G8 summit in Scotland
> in 2005. The Network also organized major protest camps and blockade
> actions against the G8 summit in Germany in 2007, and helped with the
> mobilizations against the G8 summit in Japan in 2008. Without a
> central leadership or hierarchy, the network facilitated communication
> between groups located in different cities and countries, and
> organized major meetings to discuss and decide on strategies for
> upcoming actions against the G8. The strategies were intended to
> enable diverse approaches, so many affinity groups could organize
> mutually supportive actions within a common framework rather than
> carrying out the orders of a central organization. For example, a
> blockade plan might designate one road leading to the summit site as a
> zone for people who prefer peaceful or theatrical tactics, while
> another entrance might be designated for people who wish to construct
> barricades and are willing to defend themselves against the police.
> These strategy meetings drew people from a dozen countries and
> included translations in multiple languages. Afterwards, fliers,
> announcements, position papers, and critiques were translated and
> uploaded to a website. The anarchist forms of coordination used by the
> protestors repeatedly proved effective at countering and sometimes
> even outmaneuvering the police and corporate media, which enjoyed
> teams of thousands of paid professionals, advanced communications and
> surveillance infrastructure, and resources far beyond what was
> available to the movement.
