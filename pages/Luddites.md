The Luddites were English cotton workers and others who, in the 1810s,
destroyed livelihood-threatening weaving machines. They were active in
Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, and Yorkshire. Contrary to stereotypes, the
Luddites had a "high degree of organisation," popular backing, and
sophisticated politics.[^1] The historian E.P. Thompson describes
Luddism as "a violent eruption of feeling against unrestrained
industrial capitalism."[^2]

The Luddites' first major actions were riots in Nottingham in March of
1811, where they broke sixty stocking frames (mechanical knitting
machines).[^3] By early November, the Luddites attacked in small bands,
wearing masks and using a pistol fire as a signal to retreat. Thompson
reports, "Every attack revealed planning and method."[^4] In January,
1812, workers in Yorkshire began imitating the Luddism of Nottingham.
They set a gig-mill on fire, and by February, there were nightly attacks
in some districts.[^5]

The Luddites' insurrections scared authorities, and Vice-Lieutenant Wood
wrote on 17 June 1812, "\[E\]xcept for the very spots which were
occupied by soldiers, the country was virtually in the possession of the
lawless."[^6]

According to Thompson, the Luddites "had the backing of public opinion"
in the Midlands and West Riding,[^7] in some regions, and historian Eric
Hobsbawm remarks that there was "overwhelming sympathy for machine
breakers in all parts of the population."[^8]

The Luddites were highly coordinated yet decentralized. John Zerzan and
Paula Zerzan explain, "Eschewing an alienating structure, their
organization was without a center and existed largely as an 'unspoken
code;' theirs was a non-manipulative, community organization which
trusted itself."[^9] Scholars today agree the movement's alleged
commander King Ludd was fictional and perhaps based on the apprentice
weaver Ned Ludd who smashed a loom in protest of a master who had beaten
him.[^10]

The main reason for the Luddites' demise was state repression. A
*Libcom* article describes "the destruction of the Luddites by the
State."[^11] Zerzan and Zerzan argue that the the Luddites'
"leadership," however restricted in its initial influence, ultimately
pushed the struggle into tamer legislative, reformist efforts.[^12]
