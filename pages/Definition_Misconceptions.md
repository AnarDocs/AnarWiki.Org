# Common Misconceptions About Anarchism

Primarily focusing on what the word Anarchism includes or excludes.

# Overview

The word **anarchy** derives from the Greek **anarchos**, meaning
"without rulers" or "without archons." Despite this clear etymological
meaning, anarchism faces persistent misrepresentation and deliberate
misunderstanding, particularly from authoritarian political tendencies.
These misconceptions range from simple confusion about terminology to
sophisticated philosophical attempts to redefine core anarchist concepts
in ways that legitimise hierarchy.

Understanding these misrepresentations matters because they serve a
political function: if hierarchy can be redefined to include
self-defence, expertise, or voluntary organisation, then the anarchist
critique of domination can be dismissed as incoherent or impossible.
This article examines the most common definitional disputes surrounding
anarchism and exposes the logical fallacies underlying attempts to
conflate freedom with various forms of rule.

# Terminology and Context

Disagreements between political positions often stem from differing
definitions of key terms. The same word can carry different meanings
across contexts and cultures. Two people might use identical terminology
whilst describing fundamentally different concepts, or use different
words to describe the same phenomenon.

Anarchists regularly encounter confusion about the word "anarchy" being
mistaken for chaos. This misunderstanding is usually resolved quickly
when interlocutors engage in good faith. However, deeper
misunderstandings prove far more resistant to clarification,
particularly amongst those raised in societies built entirely on
hierarchical assumptions. When someone's understanding of social
organisation rests on beliefs that rulers are necessary, that decisions
require authority figures, and that order depends on obedience,
anarchist concepts of organisation without domination appear
incomprehensible.

The word **hierarchy** itself has specific origins and common usage. It
derives from Greek **hieros** (sacred) and **arkhein** (to rule),
literally meaning "rule by priests." The term expanded to describe any
system where some hold permanent power over others: bosses over workers,
monarchs over subjects, states over citizens. Hierarchy describes
structured, enduring relations of domination, not temporary defensive
actions or voluntary associations.

# Self-Defence and Hierarchy

## The "Authority" Conflation

Some critics define hierarchy so broadly that any use of defensive force
becomes hierarchical. This argument, first systematically presented by
Friedrich Engels in his 1872 essay "On Authority," claims that
restraining an attacker—even in self-defence—constitutes authority,
therefore revolution itself requires accepting hierarchy. By this
reasoning, preventing someone from committing murder makes the defender
as authoritarian as a dictator.

This argument appears in Marxist defences of vanguardism and state
power, though some Marxists themselves recognise it as sophistry. The
logic mirrors fascist rhetoric: "If you stop us being fascists, you're
just as bad as us." Both invoke misunderstandings of tolerance and
freedom whilst obscuring the distinction between protecting freedom and
destroying it.

## Defence Versus Domination

The difference between self-defence and hierarchy lies in purpose,
organisation, and permanence:

**Self-defence** is reactive, temporary, and protective. Individuals or
communities respond to immediate harm, then the defensive action ceases.
No enduring power structures emerge from the act of defence itself.

**Hierarchy** is proactive, ongoing, and controlling. It exists to
maintain permanent power over others through structured relations of
domination.

Community defence involves voluntary organisation to protect freedom
from attack, with no one holding enduring authority over others.
Regional defence extends this principle across federated communities
without creating permanent ruling classes. Military hierarchies, by
contrast, establish lasting chains of command where officers control not
just tactical coordination but when soldiers eat, sleep, speak, move, or
die. That constitutes hierarchy.

A person, community, or region can defend itself against attacks on
safety or freedom without creating permanent structures of domination.
The distinguishing factor is not whether force exists, but whether that
force creates or protects freedom.

## Logical Fallacies

This conflation commits **false equivalence**, treating fundamentally
different uses of force as identical simply because both involve
potential violence. The critical distinctions involve purpose, duration,
and whether ongoing power relations emerge.

When someone defends themselves from attack, they exercise personal
agency, not power over others. The attacker attempted to impose
domination; self-defence rejects it.

**Tests for hierarchy versus defence:**

- Does it create permanent power relations where some command and others
  obey?
- Does it extend beyond immediate defensive needs?
- Does it establish a class with ongoing authority over others?
- Are those subjected unable to refuse or leave?

If the answer remains no—if the action is temporary, defensive, and
creates no lasting power structures—it is not hierarchy. It represents
people protecting their freedom.

# Expertise and Hierarchy

## The Authority Equivocation

Critics sometimes argue that societies with experts in specialised
fields are inherently hierarchical, claiming expertise creates
dependency and power over others. This misunderstanding exploits the
fact that "authority" describes both expertise and power, despite these
being fundamentally different concepts.

The anarchist Mikhail Bakunin addressed this distinction in 1870:

> "Does it follow that I drive back every authority? The thought would
> never occur to me. When it is a question of boots, I refer the matter
> to the authority of the cobbler; when it is a question of houses,
> canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or engineer. For
> each special area of knowledge I speak to the appropriate expert. But
> I allow neither the cobbler nor the architect nor the scientist to
> impose upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect
> merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge,
> reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and verification.
> I do not content myself with consulting a single specific authority,
> but consult several. I compare their opinions and choose that which
> seems to me most accurate. But I recognize no infallible authority,
> even in quite exceptional questions; consequently, whatever respect I
> may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an
> individual, I have absolute faith in no one. Such a faith would be
> fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my
> undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave
> and an instrument of the will and interests of another."[^1]

## Knowledge Versus Power

Consulting an expert represents a free choice to seek knowledge. A
surgeon lacks power over patients, who retain power to accept or reject
expertise. Surgeons cannot force patients onto operating tables. Compare
this to employers who possess actual power: they can terminate
employment, leaving workers unable to sustain themselves or their
families. That difference separates expertise from hierarchy.

The existence of people with greater knowledge or skill in certain areas
does not create hierarchy any more than the existence of people with
greater height creates hierarchy. Hierarchy emerges when some can make
decisions for others, compel obedience, or control others' access to
survival necessities.

## Logical Fallacies

This argument commits **equivocation** on "authority," deliberately
conflating two entirely different meanings:

- Authority as expertise (knowledge, skill, experience)
- Authority as power (the right to command, compel, or control)

Sharing a word does not make concepts equivalent. The argument also
employs **false equivalence**, treating reliance on knowledge as
identical to subjection to power. Relying on a doctor's diagnostic
expertise differs fundamentally from being subject to their power.
Patients can refuse treatment, seek second opinions, and cannot be
imprisoned for ignoring medical advice.

**Tests for expertise versus hierarchy:**

- Can the relationship compel obedience through punishment or reward?
- Does it involve control over resources necessary for survival?
- Can decisions be made for you that you cannot refuse?
- Does permanent authority extend beyond voluntary consultation?

Surgeons advise. Employers can terminate employment and access to
survival. That difference defines expertise versus hierarchy.

# Leadership and Hierarchy

## Inspiration Versus Compulsion

The words "leader" and "ruler" are sometimes used interchangeably, but
when "leader" carries positive connotations it typically refers to
someone who inspires others toward beneficial ends, or guides others
along paths they know from experience. In this sense, anarchism
accommodates leadership whilst rejecting rulership.

Storytellers, motivators, exemplary individuals, and those demonstrating
admirable strength and intelligence will always exist. Anarchists do not
consider such people infallible or accept that they possess power to
compel others. When someone can force compliance, they no longer
lead—they rule.

## Tactical Coordination

Some anarchist practices involve temporary tactical leadership,
sometimes called "pirate anarchy" or war chief systems. During combat, a
single coordinating voice might enable fighters to react quickly and
decisively. Even here, fundamental principles hold: fighters voluntarily
choose to follow tactical decisions in specific contexts. They retain
ability to refuse or leave, and grant no special deference beyond
respecting expertise whilst following into battle. When coordination
becomes compulsion or extends beyond specific purposes, it ceases being
anarchist.

Historical examples include the
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>, where military
coordinators remained accountable to their units and faced instant
replacement. This differs fundamentally from generals who can execute
soldiers for disobedience.

## Logical Fallacies

Conflating leadership with rulership commits **false equivalence**,
treating inspiration and compulsion as identical simply because both
might result in people following someone. A charismatic speaker might
inspire thousands to join a cause; a dictator might compel thousands
through threats. Both result in people "following," but one creates
freedom whilst the other destroys it.

The argument sometimes employs **slippery slope reasoning**, suggesting
any coordination or respect for expertise inevitably leads to hierarchy.
Anarchist history demonstrates this is false.

**Tests for leadership versus hierarchy:**

- Can the leader punish those who refuse to follow?
- Does authority extend beyond specific, voluntary contexts?
- Is power permanent rather than temporary coordination?
- Can people refuse, leave, or choose different leaders?

If a "leader" can force compliance, they rule rather than lead. The
distinction between inspiration and imposition defines freedom versus
tyranny.

# "Justified Hierarchy"

## The Chomsky Position

Some attempt expanding "anarchy" to accommodate rulers if they are
sufficiently qualified, representative, or beneficial, despite anarchy
literally translating to "no rulers." This manifests through arguments
that hierarchy becomes acceptable if "justified," a position notably
attributed to
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a>. Chomsky argued that "power is always illegitimate, unless
it proves itself to be legitimate," placing burden of proof on those
claiming hierarchical authority.

Whilst useful for questioning arbitrary hierarchical claims, this
position implies hierarchy can become legitimate with sufficient
justification. No justification suffices. Not voting, not divine
mandate, not merit, not expertise, not emergency, not the "greater
good." Every justification encounters counter-arguments and examples of
atrocities occurring precisely because accepted hierarchy seemed
initially well-intentioned or systematically constrained.

## The Default of Freedom

Humans are born free, limited only by nature or measures necessary for
safety. No one is born with rights to rule others, and no one consents
to subjection from birth. The default position is therefore anarchy: no
hierarchy. Any claim to rule over others represents unjust hierarchy
requiring dismantlement, not debate.

Left-authoritarian tendencies downplay the power of party chairmen or
presiding committees, pretending "vanguard parties" directing
revolutions avoid hierarchy because they claim representing "the
people." "<a   href="Right-libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Right-libertarians">Right-libertarians</a> (propertarians) have
used "anarchy" to include minimal government
("<a   href="minarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="minarchism">minarchism</a>)
whilst accepting economic hierarchy, objecting to political authority
whilst defending employers' authority as if power to impose starvation
were less coercive than power to impose arrest.

The word "anarchy" permits neither interpretation. Authoritarians
attempt co-opting the term, claiming their particular rule constitutes
freedom, moving definitional goalposts to suggest anarchists resemble
groups accepting rulers.

## Logical Fallacies

"Justified hierarchy" arguments commit **special pleading**: applying
one standard to hierarchy generally (burden of proof, presumption of
illegitimacy) whilst excepting particular hierarchies through supposedly
unique circumstances. Every tyrant claims their rule is the justified
exception.

The framework itself contains a **slippery slope**. Accepting that
hierarchy can be "justified" opens endless debate about sufficient
justification. Can preventing harm justify rule? Economic efficiency?
Maintaining order? The "will of the people"? Goalposts perpetually
shift, and those with power always find philosophers providing
justifications.

More fundamentally, it commits **false premise**: assuming consent can
be given under coercion. If authority is "justified" by pointing to
"consent," but subjects face starvation without access to controlled
resources or imprisonment for attempting departure, that consent becomes
meaningless. It resembles claiming someone consents to surrendering
their wallet under knife threat because they chose surrender over being
stabbed.

**Tests for justified anarchy versus hierarchy:**

- Does the arrangement allow genuine, un-coerced consent from all
  involved?
- Can consent be withdrawn without punishment?
- Does it avoid creating permanent power of some over others?
- Are people free to refuse or find alternatives?

If "justified hierarchy" involves people born into subjection, unable to
refuse, punished for leaving, or denied alternatives, no justification
renders it legitimate. Power over another person's life cannot be
justified when that person never had options to refuse.

# Organisation and Government

## The Conflation

Some argue that anarchist societies sharing any organisational aspect
with governments possess governments themselves, even without anyone
governing or governance occurring. If anarchist societies have
communities voluntarily belonging to distribution systems, this
supposedly constitutes government. By this logic, friends sharing dinner
form a government. Libraries are governments. Sunday football leagues
are governments. The term becomes meaningless.

This appears in arguments by those outside anarchism attempting to prove
government's inevitability, and occasionally amongst extreme
"<a   href="primitivist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="primitivist">primitivist</a> or
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist">individualist</a> anarchist tendencies.

However, even if someone cannot distinguish organisation from
government, they must still justify why their organisation requires
rulers. Conflating anarchist organisation with government does not
justify every governmental or ruling structure. The question remains:
whatever such organisation is called, should anyone rule over you?

## The Distinction

Government equals organisation plus domination. Anarchist organisation
is coordination without domination. Under governments, participation and
obedience are compulsory. In anarchist organisation, people choose
whether to associate or participate, with no one possessing power to
punish choices.

Government characteristics include:

- Hierarchical authority (power of some to command others)
- Coercive enforcement (ability to compel compliance)
- Monopoly on legitimate violence (exclusive right to use force)
- Involuntary membership (inability to opt out)

Anarchist societies with voluntary federations, rotating facilitation
roles, and horizontal decision-making differ fundamentally from states
with police, taxation, and rulers—even when both involve "organisation."

## Logical Fallacies

The argument commits **equivocation** on "government," using it to mean:

- Any coordination whatsoever
- Specific systems of hierarchical, coercive authority

By this reasoning, book clubs have "governments" because they have
organisation, or football teams have "governments" because players
possess different expertise and roles. The term becomes meaninglessly
broad.

Sometimes a **straw man** element appears if anarchism is misrepresented
as opposing all organisation, expertise, or coordination, rather than
opposing involuntary hierarchy and coercive authority.

**Tests for organisation versus government:**

- Does it claim rights to make decisions without ongoing consent?
- Can it punish non-compliance?
- Does it prevent opting out or choosing alternatives?
- Does it maintain monopoly on force within territory?

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> addressed this point: people
knowledgeable about bridge-building do not create governments unless
those engineers gain authority compelling others. The difference between
"I know how to build bridges" and "I can force you to build bridges my
way" is precisely what anarchism hinges upon.

# Democracy and Anarchism

## The Confusion

Democracy has been used variably, even by anarchists, creating
understandable confusion. Democracy can represent people having control
over their own lives, a fundamentally anarchist concept. When anarchists
advocate direct participation rather than representation, this sounds
democratic.

Some have used "direct democracy" in this context. However, this has
never meant anarchists accept majority rule—that people can vote to
restrict others' freedoms or rule as mobs over minorities. Anarchism
respects individual freedom as much as collective freedom, containing no
mechanisms for one group's will being imposed on another group. Such
imposition would cease being anarchism.

## Majority Rule Versus Self-Determination

Democracy in common usage often refers to majority rule: 51% outvoting
49% and forcing compliance. This is tyranny of the majority, a softer
tyranny than dictatorship but tyranny nonetheless. Anarchism rejects
this entirely. Three people should not vote to enslave two people,
regardless of how "democratic" the process.

Democracy commonly refers to
"<a   href="representative_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a>, which
inevitably creates mini-rulers, often controlled by party leadership or
heavily influenced by corporate sponsors, fundamentally antithetical to
anarchism. Anarchism has always opposed representative democracy because
representation politely describes letting someone else make decisions
for you.

## Confederation

Confusion arises from anarchist concepts of
"<a   href="confederation.md" class="wikilink"
title="confederation">confederation</a>, where communities or groups
work together through processes sometimes involving temporary, limited,
recallable delegates.

Confederation is not hierarchy because delegates possess no
decision-making power. They only communicate decisions already made by
their communities and face instant recall for misrepresentation. They
function as messengers, not representatives. They do not rule; they
report. Crucially, confederation is voluntary. Communities can join,
leave, or work with multiple confederations simultaneously. No one can
force participation or punish departure.

This differs fundamentally from government, where representatives
possess power to make binding decisions, cannot be instantly recalled,
and where opting out requires moving to different territory controlled
by different government. In confederation, power flows upward from
individuals and communities. In government, power flows downward from
those claiming authority to rule.

Anarchism permits both association and disassociation. It allows
separate groups fulfilling identical or similar functions in parallel,
and permits people to take no part in, remain separate from, and grant
no agreement or power to any group. If a confederation of communities
organises rubbish collection, others remain free to handle rubbish
differently or join with different communities creating alternative
systems.

## Logical Fallacies

Conflating anarchism with democracy commits **equivocation** on
"democracy," using it for radically different concepts:

- Self-determination (people controlling their own lives)
- Majority rule (51% controlling the other 49%)

These are not identical. One concerns individual and collective
autonomy; the other concerns one group possessing power over another
group, albeit smaller than under monarchy or oligarchy.

**False equivalence** appears in treating consultation and
consensus-building as identical to voting and enforcement. Anarchist
communities discuss decisions collectively, but this differs
fundamentally from democracies where majority votes create obligations
enforced by police.

The argument sometimes includes **appeal to definition**: claiming that
because anarchism involves "people power" and democracy means "people
power," they must be identical. This ignores how that power operates. In
democracy, "the people" means "the majority," exercising power over
minorities. In anarchism, "the people" means individuals and voluntary
communities exercising power over their own lives, not others.

**Tests for anarchy versus democracy:**

- Does decision-making require unanimous consent from all affected, or
  allow people to opt out?
- Does it avoid giving majorities power to coerce minorities?
- Can individuals or groups refuse participation without punishment?
- Does it allow multiple parallel solutions rather than imposed answers?

If a community can vote 6-4 to force minority compliance, that is mob
democracy, not anarchy. If communities can only make decisions applying
to willing participants, allowing others to abstain or pursue
alternatives, that is anarchy. The difference is whether anyone
possesses power over anyone else, not how many people share that power.

# Conclusion

Defending the word "anarchy" from deliberate misrepresentations is not
pedantry. It protects the concept of freedom from those diluting it into
meaninglessness. When authoritarians claim expertise is hierarchy,
self-defence is domination, coordination is government, and temporary
tactical leadership equals permanent rule, they attempt making freedom
from rulers appear impossible and hierarchy inevitable.

Experience demonstrates otherwise. Freedom exists in friendships,
communities, and voluntary associations daily. The differences between
sharing knowledge and controlling lives, between choosing cooperation
and forced obedience, between defending ourselves and ruling over
others, are clear and tangible.

Anarchy means no rulers. Not "better rulers" or "justified rulers" or
"democratic rulers." No rulers. This simplicity is precisely what makes
it radical.
