# Collectivist Anarchism

## History

**Collectivist anarchism**, also called **anarchist collectivism** and
**anarcho-collectivism**,[^1] is an
"<a   href="anarchist_school_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist school of thought">anarchist school of thought</a> that
envisions both the "<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">collective ownership</a> of the means of
production, and the entitlement of workers to the fruits of their own
labour,[^2] which would be ensured by a societal pact between
individuals and collectives.[^3] Collectivists considered
"<a   href="trade_union.md" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
unions</a> to be the means through which to bring about collectivism
through a "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a>, where they would form
the nucleus for a post-capitalist society.[^4]

### Origins

Collectivist anarchism was first formulated within the
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA), under the influence of
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>.[^5] Bakunin had been
inspired by the traditional agrarian collectivism practiced by the
Russian peasantry and wished to see its principles of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
applied to industrial society, which he hoped to mobilise in favour of
"<a   href="liberty.md" class="wikilink" title="liberty">liberty</a> and
"<a   href="social_equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="social equality">social equality</a>.[^6] According to
"<a   href="Friedrich_Engels.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>, Bakunin's collectivism
represented a synthesis of
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s
"<a   href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a> and
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>'s
"<a   href="Mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">mutualism</a>.[^7]

Bakunin rejected the communist principle of "from each according to
their ability, to each according to their needs", considering instead
that resources would have to be distributed according to one's own
labour. While Bakunin accepted Proudhon's organisational theory of
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>,
he also rejected the mutualist centring of the independent
"<a   href="artisan.md" class="wikilink" title="artisan">artisan</a>, instead
considering the
"<a   href="collective.md" class="wikilink" title="collective">collective</a>
to be the base social unit for organising society.[^8]

Bakunin's collectivism had widespread appeal in
"<a   href="Spain.md" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a>, where
industrial workers and rural peasants found inspiration in its precepts
of "<a   href="decentralisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralisation">decentralisation</a> and
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>.[^9] From the outset of anarchism's introduction to Spain in
1868,[^10] Spanish anarchists largely subscribed to collectivism,
inspired by Bakunin's anarchist doctrine,[^11] while also drawing from
the "<a   href="anti-authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarianism</a> and
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>
espoused by "<a   href="Francesc_Pi_i_Margall.md" class="wikilink"
title="Francesc Pi i Margall">Francesc Pi i Margall</a>.[^12]

Pi's influence on the collectivists was most pronounced in the work of
"<a   href="Juan_Serrano_Oteiza.md" class="wikilink"
title="Juan Serrano Oteiza">Juan Serrano Oteiza</a>, an early convert to
collectivist anarchism who envisaged a federal society that upheld the
"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a> of the
individual, trade union and municipality.[^13] But Serrano's
collectivism differed from Pi's federalism by rejecting reformist
political parties and instead upholding the
"<a   href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a> as the agents of revolutionary change.[^14]

By the 1870s, the
"<a   href="Spanish_Regional_Federation_of_the_IWA.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Regional Federation">Spanish Regional Federation</a> of
the
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (FRE-AIT) had widely disseminated the
doctrine of collectivist anarchism, with its principles being widely
adopted by workers' societies, many of which were not even anarchist
themselves.[^15] Following the collapse of the FRE-AIT, in 1881, the
Barcelona branch reconstituted the organisation as the
"<a   href="Federation_of_Workers_of_the_Spanish_Region.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federation of Workers of the Spanish Region">Federation of
Workers of the Spanish Region</a> (FTRE), which was established
according to the principles of collectivist anarchism.[^16]

### Break with anarcho-communism

While anarchist theory in Spain remained stagnant, with collectivist
positions staying largely unchanged, the international anarchist
movement developed towards "<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a> and many anarchists
began to adopt the theory of
"<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>,[^17] in a
process spearheaded by the "<a   href="Anarchism_in_Italy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Italian anarchists">Italian anarchists</a>.[^18] Within the
"<a   href="Jura_Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="Jura Federation">Jura
Federation</a>, collectivists led by
"<a   href="Adhémar_Schwitzguébel.md" class="wikilink"
title="Adhémar Schwitzguébel">Adhémar Schwitzguébel</a> resisted the
adoption of communism, but the transition from collectivism to communism
went by largely without controversy. However, in Spain, where
collectivist anarchists had been uniquely successful within the trade
unionist movement, collectivism maintained its foothold for much longer
than in other countries. It was only when their trade union activities
began to be suppressed that the Spanish anarchists gravitated towards
communism.[^19]

The anarcho-communists criticized the collectivist model of workers'
entitlement to the fruit of their labour, which they believed would
disenfranchise non-producers and risk creating a new ruling class that
determined wages. Instead, they advocate for the abolition of wage
labour and its replacement with a system of solidarity, where all
property was held in common.[^20] This development of collectivism into
communism had been preceded by the writings of
"<a   href="James_Guillaume.md" class="wikilink" title="James Guillaume">James
Guillaume</a>, who outlined a post-capitalist system where resources
would be distributed "from each according to their ability, to each
according to their needs", while the collectivist system would be used
during the transition out of capitalism.[^21]

In organizational terms, the communists opposed the trade unions
advocated by the collectivists, viewing them as fundamentally reformist
and bureaucratic, and thus as incompatible with anti-authoritarian
models of organization.[^22] Instead, the communists preferred small
"<a   href="affinity_group.md" class="wikilink"
title="affinity group">affinity groups</a> that could carry out violent
attacks against the economic order, upholding the theory of
"<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>.[^23]

In 1884, the "<a   href="Seville_Congress.md" class="wikilink"
title="Seville Congress">Seville Congress</a> of the FTRE resulted in
many anarchists leaving the organisation, as they no longer believed it
to be the best vehicle for organising the working class towards a social
revolution. This preceded a complete break between Spanish collectivists
and communists, which took place the following year.[^24] Serrano
attempted to defend the collectivism of the FTRE from the rise of
communism, considering the two tendencies to be irreconcilably opposed
to each other.[^25] But Serrano's arguments were unsuccessful in
rallying support, as the more moderate collectivism began to give way to
the more radical communism.[^26]

### Decline of collectivism

The rise of communism, which challenged the collectivist principles of
the FTRE, eventually resulted in the organisation's dissolution.[^27] In
1888, the Catalan regional federation of the FTRE was reorganised into
the "<a   href="Pact_of_Union_and_Solidarity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pact of Union and Solidarity">Pact of Union and Solidarity</a>
(PUS), which nominally retained a collectivist orientation, but accepted
members from all tendencies.[^28] The collectivist
"<a   href="Ricardo_Mella.md" class="wikilink" title="Ricardo Mella">Ricardo
Mella</a> opposed the formation of the Pact, as he considered it to be a
fundamentally communist organisation and worried it would undermine the
FTRE.[^29]

The collapse of the FTRE marked the supplanting of collectivism as the
dominant anarchist ideology in Spain, as the communists consolidated
control over the movement.[^30] Mella hoped to reconstitute the FTRE,
refusing to even recognise its dissolution and proposing its
reorganisation along more decentralised lines.[^31] But his efforts were
ultimately futile, as most Spanish collectivists supported the
dissolution of the FTRE.[^32]

In the years that followed, efforts were made in the libertarian press
to reconcile the split.[^33] In the pages of *El Productor*, the
collectivist Cels Gomis i Mestre made appeals against
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">dogmatism</a>.[^34]
Anarchists that opposed the schism eventually went on to establish the
tendency of ""<a   href="anarchism_without_adjectives.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchism without adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>",
in order to overcome the ideological disputes between the two
factions.[^35]

The collectivist-communist debate also inspired
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> to develop towards a
"<a   href="Pluralism_(political_philosophy).md" class="wikilink"
title="pluralist">pluralist</a> conception of anarchism.[^36] Although
he personally favoured anarcho-communism, he distinguished between his
desired ends and the means by which the
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a> would take place,
believing that the organisation of society should be left to spontaneous
development.[^37] He thus proposed a union between communists and
collectivists, based on a common tactical line, arguing against
dogmatism as an "<a   href="authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> instinct.[^38] But in spite of
his pluralist inclinations, Malatesta continued to argue against
collectivism, considering it to be incompatible with anarchism.[^39]

By the end of the 19th century, collectivism had been reduced to a
minority tendency in Spain, subsumed by anarcho-communism.[^40] This
also gave way to the development of
"<a   href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>, which united
"<a   href="Community_organizing.md" class="wikilink"
title="community">community</a> and labour organizing, overcoming both
the "<a   href="Localism_(politics).md" class="wikilink"
title="localism">localism</a> of the collectivists and the
conspiratorial nature of the communists.[^41]

### Current Status

Collectivist anarchism remained prominent in the rural areas of
"<a   href="Andalusia.md" class="wikilink" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>,
where local
"<a   href="skilled_worker.md" class="wikilink" title="skilled worker">skilled
workers</a> were attracted to the promises of collective labour, with
individual ownership over the fruits of that labour.[^42] During the
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>, many
of the ideas proposed by collectivist anarchism were put into practice,
as the advance of the "<a   href="confederal_militias.md" class="wikilink"
title="confederal militias">confederal militias</a> gave way to the
widespread "<a   href="Collective_farming.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivization of agriculture">collectivization of
agriculture</a> (around 35-40%) throughout the
"<a   href="Second_Spanish_Republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Republic">Spanish Republic</a>.[^43]

Modern descendants of collectivist anarchism include
"<a   href="participatory_economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="participatory economics">participatory economics</a>, as
advocated by
"<a   href="Michael_Albert.md" class="wikilink" title="Michael Albert">Michael
Albert</a> and
"<a   href="Robin_Hahnel.md" class="wikilink" title="Robin Hahnel">Robin
Hahnel</a>, which takes up the collectivist model of remuneration.[^44]

## Organisation

Collectivist anarchism was organised around the principle that
"<a   href="trade_union.md" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
unions</a> would serve as the primary vehicle for revolutionary change
and the nucleus of a post-capitalist society. The movement envisioned a
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federal">federal</a>
structure where individual
"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>, trade
union independence, and municipal self-governance would be maintained
through voluntary association and mutual aid.

The organisational model rejected centralised authority and instead
promoted "<a   href="decentralisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralisation">decentralisation</a> and
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> as core principles. Collectivists believed that workers'
societies and unions would naturally evolve into the governing
structures of a post-revolutionary society, with each collective
maintaining control over its means of production while coordinating with
others through federal arrangements.

This organisational approach differed significantly from both
"<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">mutualism</a>,
which centred on independent artisans, and later
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>, which favoured small
"<a   href="affinity_group.md" class="wikilink"
title="affinity group">affinity groups</a> over larger trade union
structures.

## Economics

The economic model of collectivist anarchism is built on the principle
of "<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">collective ownership</a> of the means of
production combined with individual entitlement to the fruits of one's
labour. This system would ensure that workers receive compensation
proportional to their work contribution, rejecting both capitalist wage
labour and the communist principle of distribution according to need.

Under collectivist anarchism, the means of production - factories, land,
tools, and machinery - would be owned collectively by the workers who
operate them. However, unlike
"<a   href="anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>, the products of labour
would be distributed according to the amount and quality of work
performed by each individual. This creates a system where personal
incentive is maintained while eliminating capitalist exploitation and
private ownership of productive resources.

The economic organisation would be coordinated through a network of
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_council.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a> and federations,
operating on principles of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and voluntary cooperation. Trade unions would serve as both the agents
of revolutionary change and the fundamental economic units of the new
society, managing production and distribution according to collective
decisions made by their members.

Collectivists argued that this system would eliminate the possibility of
a new ruling class emerging, as no individual or group could accumulate
private ownership of productive resources. At the same time, they
believed it would provide stronger work incentives than a purely
communist system, as individuals would directly benefit from their
labour contributions.

The model also incorporated elements of
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>
in its economic structure, with local collectives maintaining autonomy
over their internal affairs while participating in broader economic
coordination through voluntary federation with other collectives and
regions.

## Criticism

"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communists">Anarcho-communists</a> criticized the
collectivist model for potentially creating new forms of inequality and
hierarchy. They argued that the system of rewarding workers according to
their labour contribution could disenfranchise non-producers such as
children, elderly, and disabled individuals, effectively creating a new
ruling class of productive workers who would determine wages and working
conditions.

Critics also contended that maintaining any form of wage system, even
one based on labour contribution rather than capitalist profit, would
perpetuate competitive relationships between workers and undermine the
solidarity necessary for true anarchist society. They advocated instead
for the complete abolition of wage labour and its replacement with a
system based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and free distribution according to need.

From an organisational perspective, anarcho-communists viewed the
collectivist emphasis on trade unions as fundamentally reformist and
bureaucratic, arguing that such large-scale organisations were
incompatible with anti-authoritarian principles. They preferred smaller,
more flexible "<a   href="affinity_group.md" class="wikilink"
title="affinity group">affinity groups</a> that could maintain
revolutionary purity and avoid the bureaucratic tendencies they saw as
inherent in union structures.

"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, despite his efforts to
reconcile the two tendencies, ultimately argued that collectivism was
incompatible with anarchism due to its retention of wage-based
distribution, which he believed would inevitably lead to new forms of
authority and inequality.
