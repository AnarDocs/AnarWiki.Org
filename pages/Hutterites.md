# Hutterites and Bruderhof

The **Hutterites** and **Bruderhof** represent two of the most
significant examples of successful
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
organization in the modern world, demonstrating that large-scale
"<a   href="communalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="communalism">communalism</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and "<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> can function effectively
across centuries. Though both communities identify as
"<a   href="Anabaptist.md" class="wikilink" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>
Christians rather than explicitly anarchist, their practices of
"<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a>, rejection of private
property, consensus decision-making, and resistance to state authority
embody core anarchist principles in ways that secular anarchist
movements often struggle to achieve.

## Overview

The Hutterites, founded by
"<a   href="Jakob_Hutter.md" class="wikilink" title="Jakob Hutter">Jakob
Hutter</a> in 1528, represent one of the oldest continuous experiments
in "<a   href="communal_living.md" class="wikilink"
title="communal living">communal living</a> and
"<a   href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a>.[^1] For nearly 500
years, Hutterite communities have maintained
"<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a> of all property, rejected
individual accumulation, and organized themselves through collective
decision-making processes that prioritize community consensus over
hierarchical authority.

The Bruderhof, founded by "<a   href="Eberhard_Arnold.md" class="wikilink"
title="Eberhard Arnold">Eberhard Arnold</a> in Germany in 1920, draws
inspiration from both early Christianity and the historical Hutterite
model while adapting anarchist principles to modern conditions.[^2] Both
movements demonstrate that anarchist organization - the absence of
rulers rather than the absence of order - can provide stable, prosperous
societies over extended periods.

As "<a   href="Catholic_Worker_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Worker Movement">Catholic Worker Movement</a> founder
Dorothy Day observed: "The Hutterite communities and the kibbutzim of
Israel are two examples of successful farming communities in the world
today. The Hutterite colonies are nonviolent and truly self-sustaining,
built on poverty and hard labor and dedication."[^3]

## History

### Hutterite Origins: Radical Reformation

The Hutterites emerged from the
"<a   href="Radical_Reformation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Radical Reformation">Radical Reformation</a> of the 16th century,
specifically from the
"<a   href="Anabaptist.md" class="wikilink" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>
movement that rejected both state authority and established church
hierarchy. Unlike mainstream Protestant reformers who sought to work
within existing power structures, the Anabaptists advocated for complete
separation from worldly authority and the creation of alternative
societies based on voluntary association.[^4]

Jakob Hutter's innovation was establishing communities based on the
"<a   href="Schleitheim_Confession.md" class="wikilink"
title="Schleitheim Confession">Schleitheim Confession</a> of 1527, which
declared complete separation from state authority, rejection of oaths of
allegiance, and commitment to
"<a   href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a>.[^5]
Most significantly, Hutter implemented complete
"<a   href="community_of_goods.md" class="wikilink"
title="community of goods">community of goods</a> - the abolition of
private property and the establishment of collective ownership of all
resources.

This radical experiment faced immediate persecution from both Catholic
and Protestant authorities, leading to centuries of migration across
Europe as Hutterites sought places where they could practice their
stateless form of organization.

### Persecution and Diaspora

The Hutterite experience illustrates how states respond to successful
anarchist alternatives - with systematic persecution and attempts at
destruction. For centuries, Hutterites were driven from country to
country: from Moravia to Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia, Ukraine, and
eventually North America.

During the "<a   href="Thirty_Years&#39;_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Thirty Years&#39; War">Thirty Years' War</a>, Habsburg forces
specifically targeted Hutterite communities, "annihilated and plundered
several Hutterite settlements" in attempts to destroy their example of
successful stateless organization.[^6] The bubonic plague that followed
the war killed a third of the remaining Hutterites, nearly destroying
the movement entirely.

This pattern of state persecution continued even after migration to
North America. During World War I, the U.S. government imprisoned
Hutterite conscientious objectors, with two dying from mistreatment at
Leavenworth Military Prison.[^7] This persecution forced most Hutterites
to flee to Canada, demonstrating how states will use violence to
suppress alternatives to their authority.

### Bruderhof: Modern Renewal

The Bruderhof represents a 20th-century renewal of anarchist communalism
inspired by the Hutterite example. Founded by Eberhard Arnold in
post-World War I Germany, the Bruderhof emerged from the
"<a   href="German_Youth_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="German Youth Movement">German Youth Movement</a> and the social
crisis following the war.[^8]

Arnold's vision combined traditional Anabaptist principles with modern
understanding of social organization, creating communities that
maintained anarchist principles while engaging more actively with the
broader world than traditional Hutterites.

Like their predecessors, the Bruderhof faced immediate persecution from
authoritarian states. Nazi Germany disbanded their communities in 1937,
forcing members to flee to England and eventually Paraguay.[^9] This
pattern of state hostility toward successful anarchist alternatives
continued throughout the 20th century.

## Organization and Governance

### Collective Decision-Making

Both Hutterites and Bruderhof practice forms of
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> that prioritize consensus
and collective wisdom over hierarchical authority. Hutterite governance
operates through a "two-tiered structure including a council—usually
seven senior males—and the voting membership, which includes all the
married men of the colony."[^10]

While this system maintains some patriarchal elements, it fundamentally
rejects the concentration of permanent power in any individual. All
leadership positions are elected and can be removed by community vote.
Most importantly, decisions require broad consensus rather than simple
majority rule or dictatorial decree.

The Bruderhof has evolved toward more inclusive decision-making
processes while maintaining the principle that authority flows from the
community rather than being imposed from above. Both movements
demonstrate that complex societies can function through collective
deliberation rather than hierarchical command.

### Rejection of Private Property

The most radical aspect of both movements is their complete rejection of
private property in favor of "<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a>. As the Hutterite practice
is described: "all property is owned by the colony, and provisions for
individual members and their families come from the common
resources."[^11]

This extends beyond mere sharing of resources to a fundamental
transformation of social relationships. There are "no paychecks on
Hutterite colonies, as members are expected to work for the good of the
community."[^12] The Bruderhof requires that members take vows to "put
yourself completely at the disposal of the church community to the end
of your life—all your faculties, the entire strength of your body and
soul, and all your property."[^13]

This elimination of private property serves multiple anarchist
functions: - Prevents the accumulation of wealth that creates class
divisions - Eliminates the employer-employee relationship central to
capitalism - Makes community decisions based on collective need rather
than individual profit - Creates material basis for genuine equality and
solidarity

### Autonomous Communities

Both movements organize themselves as networks of autonomous communities
rather than centralized institutions. Hutterite colonies typically
contain 60-250 people and maintain independence in day-to-day operations
while cooperating with other colonies.[^14] When colonies grow beyond
sustainable size, they split to create new autonomous communities rather
than building hierarchical super-structures.

This
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalist">federalist</a>
approach allows for local self-governance while maintaining solidarity
and mutual aid between communities. It demonstrates how anarchist
organization can scale beyond individual communities without requiring
centralized state authority.

## Economic Organization

### Beyond Capitalism

Both movements have created economic systems that transcend capitalist
social relations while demonstrating remarkable productivity and
prosperity. Hutterite colonies "often own large tracts of land and,
since they function as a collective unit, they can make or afford
higher-quality equipment than if they were working alone."[^15]

This collective ownership allows communities to make long-term decisions
based on community welfare rather than short-term profit maximization.
Hutterite agriculture is "specialized and more or less industrialized"
but organized around collective benefit rather than individual
accumulation.[^16]

The Bruderhof operates multiple successful businesses including
Community Playthings and Rifton Equipment, generating significant income
while maintaining collective ownership and worker control.[^17] "Income
from all businesses is pooled and used for the care of all members and
for various communal outreach efforts."[^18]

### Mutual Aid and Social Security

Both movements demonstrate how
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
can replace state welfare systems. Communities provide housing,
healthcare, education, childcare, and support for elderly and disabled
members through collective effort rather than market mechanisms or state
provision.

As Dorothy Day observed: "They are self-supporting, a self-subsistent
community, not tax-exempt but paying corporate taxes."[^19] Communities
meet their obligations to the broader society while maintaining internal
systems based on cooperation rather than competition.

### Gift Economy Elements

While both movements engage with capitalist markets externally, they
operate internal
"<a   href="gift_economies.md" class="wikilink" title="gift economies">gift
economies</a> where goods and services flow according to need rather
than ability to pay. Members contribute according to ability and receive
according to need, demonstrating the practical viability of communist
economic principles.

## Culture and Values

### Anti-Materialism

Both movements practice "<a   href="voluntary_simplicity.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary simplicity">voluntary simplicity</a> and reject the
consumerism central to capitalist culture. Hutterite communities
maintain that material possessions beyond basic necessities create
inequality and spiritual corruption. The Bruderhof similarly emphasizes
that "sharing everything" prevents the accumulation that leads to class
division.[^20]

This anti-materialist culture supports anarchist values by: - Preventing
the wealth concentration that creates ruling classes - Focusing
community energy on collective welfare rather than individual
accumulation - Demonstrating that human fulfillment doesn't require
competitive consumption - Creating space for spiritual and intellectual
development beyond material acquisition

### Pacifism and Non-Violence

Both movements practice absolute
"<a   href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a>,
refusing military service and rejecting violence as a means of resolving
conflicts. This pacifism extends beyond simple anti-war sentiment to a
comprehensive rejection of coercive authority.

As the Hutterite principles state: "forbidding its members from taking
part in military activities, taking orders from military persons,
wearing a formal uniform (such as a soldier's or a police officer's) or
paying taxes to be spent on war."[^21]

This rejection of state violence demonstrates that complex societies can
maintain order and resolve conflicts through non-violent means - a core
anarchist principle that states claim is impossible.

### Gender and Social Relations

While both movements maintain some traditional gender roles, they have
also created more egalitarian relationships in many areas. The Bruderhof
practices what they call "intersectional feminism" and rejects many
mainstream gender expectations.[^22]

More significantly, both movements eliminate the competitive
individualism that capitalism requires, creating space for more
cooperative and nurturing social relationships across all community
members.

## Modern Relevance and Success

### Scale and Longevity

The success of both movements challenges common assumptions about
anarchist organization. Hutterites now number over 55,000 people in more
than 570 communities across North America.[^23] The Bruderhof includes
approximately 3,000 members in 24 communities worldwide.[^24]

This scale demonstrates that anarchist principles can work not just in
small intentional communities but in substantial populations spanning
multiple countries and cultures.

### Economic Viability

Both movements prove that anarchist economics can generate prosperity
and security. Hutterite communities "generate around \$600,000 per year"
through their collective enterprises.[^25] The Bruderhof operates
successful international businesses while maintaining collective
ownership and worker control.

This economic success challenges capitalist claims that private property
and individual competition are necessary for productivity and
innovation.

### Technological Innovation

Contrary to stereotypes about traditional communities, both movements
embrace appropriate technology while maintaining social values.
Hutterites use modern agricultural equipment and some communities have
internet access.[^26] The Bruderhof "own and drive cars and run modern
businesses and factories" while maintaining community-centered
values.[^27]

This demonstrates that anarchist organization is compatible with
technological advancement when technology serves community needs rather
than private profit.

## Limitations and Critiques

### Religious Framework

Both movements operate within explicitly Christian frameworks that may
limit their appeal to secular anarchists. However, their practical
organization demonstrates anarchist principles regardless of theological
justification.

### Social Conservatism

Both movements maintain some traditional social arrangements,
particularly around gender roles and family structure, that may conflict
with anarchist ideals of complete liberation. However, these limitations
don't negate their achievements in economic and political organization.

### Cultural Insularity

Both movements maintain some separation from mainstream society, which
may limit their direct influence on broader social change. However,
their example demonstrates alternative possibilities that can inspire
broader movements.

## Lessons for Anarchist Theory and Practice

### Proving Anarchist Viability

The Hutterites and Bruderhof provide the most successful long-term
examples of anarchist organization in the modern world. Their centuries
of stable, prosperous, voluntary communities demonstrate that:

\- Complex societies can function without centralized state authority -
Economic productivity and innovation don't require private property or
capitalist competition - Social order can be maintained through
cooperation rather than coercion -
"<a   href="Mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">Mutual aid</a>
can provide comprehensive social security more effectively than state
welfare - Democratic participation increases rather than decreases
community stability

### Economic Alternatives

Both movements demonstrate practical alternatives to both capitalism and
state socialism: - Collective ownership of productive resources - Worker
control of economic decisions - Distribution based on need rather than
market power - Long-term planning based on community welfare -
Integration of economic and social goals

### Organizational Models

The federal structure of both movements provides models for anarchist
organization that can scale beyond local communities while maintaining
autonomy and direct democracy. Their experience shows how autonomous
communities can cooperate effectively without surrendering independence
to centralized authority.

### Cultural Transformation

Both movements demonstrate how alternative cultures can be created and
sustained over long periods. Their success in creating anti-materialist,
cooperative, non-violent cultures shows that deep social transformation
is possible through lived example rather than political revolution
alone.

## Contemporary Significance

In an era of growing inequality, environmental crisis, and political
polarization, the Hutterites and Bruderhof offer proven examples of
societies organized around cooperation rather than competition,
sustainability rather than growth, and community welfare rather than
individual accumulation.

Their success over centuries demonstrates that anarchist principles
aren't utopian dreams but practical alternatives that have worked and
continue to work for substantial populations. As Dorothy Day concluded:
"The Hutterite way of life is based on the second chapter of the Book of
Acts... 'all those whose faith had drawn them together held everything
in common.'"[^28]

For contemporary anarchists, these movements provide both inspiration
and practical models for building alternatives to capitalist and state
authority. They prove that
"<a   href="anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchy">anarchy</a> - society
without rulers - can provide prosperity, security, and human fulfillment
more effectively than systems based on domination and exploitation.
