# Workerism

Workerism is a form of
<a href="capitalist" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
ideology that elevates wage labour and manual work above other forms of
struggle and social organization. From an anarchist perspective,
workerism represents an acceptance of, and propaganda for, the worker
identity under capitalism rather than its abolition. It is considered
one of the highest forms of
<a href="alienation" class="wikilink" title="alienation">alienation</a>,
as it encourages individuals who recognize exploitation to nonetheless
glorify the condition of being exploited.

The term is also used to describe **operaismo**, an Italian
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> tendency
that emerged in the 1960s, though this represents a different
theoretical tradition with distinct characteristics.

## Overview

Workerism manifests as an ideology that praises only "productive" labour
while dismissing other forms of work and struggle. It promotes manual
labour and factory work as the privileged sites of revolutionary
activity, often to the exclusion of other sectors and forms of
resistance. This fixation on industrial production reveals not a genuine
commitment to working class liberation, but rather a fetishization of
particular forms of labour under capitalism.

The worship of workers appears in various state ideologies, including
<a href="Stalinism" class="wikilink" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and
<a href="Nazism" class="wikilink" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, where
workers are honored for their role as builders of the nation and
economy. Within ostensibly revolutionary movements, workerism similarly
glorifies productive labour while maintaining the fundamental structures
that create the worker as a social category.

## Origins

Workerism has been present in the workers' movement since its inception.
The earliest workers' societies were Christian-inspired and praised
diligence, thrift, and hard work. These moralistic ideas persist in
workerism as a remaining bastion of Christian ideology within working
class movements. The connection between workerism and Protestant work
ethic demonstrates how capitalist values penetrate even movements
claiming to oppose capitalism.

## Characteristics

### Focus on Manual Labour

Workerism elevates manual labour and "work with hammers" while vilifying
office workers and service industry workers. Its vision of the
proletarian is the muscle-bound male, revealing an underlying
<a href="sexism" class="wikilink" title="sexism">sexism</a> through its
rejection of the large proportion of female wage-workers in offices and
shops. This narrow focus on industrial production ignores the reality
that exploitation occurs across all sectors of the economy.

### Moralism

The strongest proponents of workerism are often not manual workers who
have had no choice in their labour, but ex-marginals who make a moral
decision to become "revolutionary" manual workers. Their advocacy
compensates for uncertainty about their own class status and serves as
moral condemnation of proletarians who make different choices. This
moralizing tendency contradicts genuine revolutionary analysis, which
examines material conditions rather than individual virtue.

### Hierarchical Perspective

Workerism searches for crucial fractions within the proletariat whose
struggle is privileged over others. This reveals a hierarchical outlook
that sees
<a href="communism" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a> as
a predetermined program requiring troops to implement it, rather than an
organic development of class struggle. The theory resembles antique
socialism such as Second International
<a href="social_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a> or
<a href="syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, viewing class struggle as bourgeois
war with foot-soldiers and generals. The "revolutionary" determines the
program while workers execute it.

## Relationship to History

Workerist theory claims revolution arises from escalation of workers'
day-to-day struggles in capitalism. History contradicts this repeatedly:

- The French and Russian revolutions were triggered by women's struggles
- The German and Portuguese revolutions began with military mutinies
- The Paris 1968 uprising started with student struggles

Workerism responds to these falsifications not by correcting theory, but
by falsifying history. The role of non-workers is marginalized or
denied. Revolutionary theory should analyze actual events to understand
capitalism's weak points rather than imposing predetermined frameworks.

## Critique

### Productive vs Non-Productive Labour

Workerists claim productive workers hold a position from which they can
bring down capitalism by withdrawing labour. This exaggerates the
centrality of production within the
<a href="accumulation" class="wikilink"
title="accumulation">accumulation</a> cycle. Workers in communication,
distribution, and circulation also wield significant leverage. A bank
workers' strike might affect capital more strongly than a car factory
strike. Urban riots might prove more powerful than either.

### Intellectualism and Workerism

Workerism and intellectualism are not opposed but complementary. Both
maintain the separation of thought and action inherent to capitalism.
Workers must implement the theorist's ideas, preserving the de facto
privilege of thought over action. Workerists critique other
intellectuals while exempting themselves, pretending to be something
other than specialized thinkers. They claim workers should shun
intellectuals while following the workerist intellectual's program.

### Revolutionary Subject

The revolutionary subject is not solely productive workers or even all
workers. It is the <a href="proletariat" class="wikilink"
title="proletariat">proletariat</a>—those without social power or
wealth, those with nothing to lose but their chains. Non-proletarian
strata can participate fully in revolutionary situations when the
proletariat is active, as seen in the revolutionary peasants of the
<a href="Makhnovist_movement" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> and the communist
communities during the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

## Beyond Workerism

### End of Syndicalism

The end of <a href="syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="syndicalism">syndicalism</a> corresponds to the end of workerism.
Both represent the decline of a quantitative illusion that characterized
party and synthesis organization models. The revolt ahead must find new
paths beyond these exhausted forms.

<a href="Trade_unions" class="wikilink" title="Trade unions">Trade
unions</a> are in decline. With this structural form of struggle, an era
disappears—a model that envisioned the future as improved reproduction
of the old world. Revolutionary syndicalism pushed combative workers
forward while simultaneously limiting their capacity to envision future
society or revolution's creative needs. Everything remained confined
within factory dimensions.

### Transformation of Production

Society moves toward new transformations in productive and social
structures. Methods of struggle, perspectives, and short-term projects
are transforming alongside these changes. In expanding industrial
society, trade unions shifted from instruments of struggle to
instruments supporting the productive structure itself.

The factory is disappearing, replaced by new productive organizations
based primarily on automation. Yesterday's workers face partial
integration into supporting situations or mere social security. New work
forms appear on the horizon. The classical workers' front no longer
exists, and neither does the trade union in its previous form. It has
become a firm like any other.

### New Forms of Struggle

A network of increasingly different relations under the banner of
participation, pluralism, and democracy spreads across society, bridling
nearly all forces of subversion. The extreme aspects of revolutionary
projects face systematic criminalization.

Struggle will take new paths, filtering toward a thousand subterranean
channels and emerging in countless explosions of rage and destruction
with new symbology. Anarchists must avoid remaining distant from
phenomena they fail to understand, whose violence might eventually
frighten them. Full analysis must be developed to comprehend and
participate in emerging forms of resistance.

The aim of the communist movement is not a workers' state or proletarian
dictatorship but the abolition of all classes in the human community
created through anti-capitalist struggle.

## Operaismo

The term "workerism" also translates the Italian **operaismo**, a
distinct <a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>
tendency that emerged in Italy during the 1960s. Unlike the workerism
critiqued by anarchists, operaismo developed as a "workerism against
work" that sought to destroy the condition of being a worker rather than
glorify it. This tradition emphasized working class autonomy and the
refusal of work, influenced Italian autonomist movements, and impacted
post-war <a href="Italian_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="Italian anarchism">Italian anarchism</a>.[^1]
