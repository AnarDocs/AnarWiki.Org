# Social Ecology

Social ecology can refer to a number of praxes exploring the
interconnections of social oppression and ecological destruction. Henry
David Thoreau (1817-1862), Elisée Reclus (1830-1905), and Piotr
Kropotkin (1842-1921) have sometimes been described as early social
ecologists or "forerunners" to social ecology.[^1] John Clark defines
social ecology as:

> an ecological philosophy based on a dialectical (but nontotalizing)
> view of reality. It interprets all natural and social phenomena as
> mutually determining parts of larger wholes and as being in a process
> of development and unfolding. Any whole is seen as a complex,
> developing unity-in-diversity that can be understood to the degree
> that its elements, their relationships, and the history of its
> development are understood. A consistent social ecology must, in view
> of its radically dialectical quality, reject any kind of reification
> of phenomena or concepts, any dualistic divisions within any sphere of
> reality, or any process of totalization that transforms dynamic wholes
> into closed systems (whether natural, social, or intellectual). These
> principles are applied to the evolution of humanity and the entire
> course of human history, in relation to natural history and the
> evolution of life on earth.[^2]

The term social ecology is usually associated with the version developed
by Murray Bookchin, who was largely influenced by his mentor Josef Weber
who wrote about bourgeois society's contributions to ecological
destruction through "'atomic and bacteriological war', 'reckless
exhaustion of agricultural soil', 'despoliation of forests',
'extermination of fauna', 'so-called erosion or "land cancer'",
'contamination, dangerous to life, of rivers and coasts' and 'production
diseases'."[^3]

Bookchin's version of social ecology asserts that social hierarchy is
the root cause of environmental destruction. The implication, then, is
that any solution to environmental crises must involve a struggle
against social hierarchy.

Bookchin posited an account of the rise of hierarchy, a political
strategy for social change (libertarian municipalism, or Communalism),
and even a philosophy for understanding evolution (dialectical
naturalism). Unusual for an Anarchist, Bookchin advocated running Green
candidates for local office to educate the public about Anarchism.
Bookchin had heated debates with syndicalists, deep ecologists,
primitivists, proponents of consensus decision-making, and many others
who disagreed with him. Toward the end of his life, Bookchin broke with
Anarchism, advancing Social Ecology as a stand-alone theory.

The remainder of this article focuses on Bookchinite or orthodox
versions of Social Ecology (with a big-S and big-E). However, other
versions of social ecology have developed by John P. Clark and by the

# Culture

Bookchin conceptualized freedom based on a study of ecology. He wrote,
"My definition of the term 'libertarian' is guided by my description of
the ecosystem: the image of unity in diversity, spontaneity, and
complementary relationships, free from all hierarchy and
domination."[^4] Bookchin revolutionized Anarchist theory by making
*hierarchy* a core concept. Formerly, Anarchism explicitly opposed the
State and capitalism and implicitly opposed other oppressive structures
such as patriarchy, white supremacy, and militarism. Bookchin assigned
all these structures to a common category: *hierarchy.*[^5]

Social Ecologists say that while people must self-determine their lives,
people can only exercise their full capacities in a socially-engaged
life. Freedom, for Social Ecologists, has a social aspect and can not be
reduced to individual autonomy alone.

For Social Ecology, environmental crisis made freedom into an urgent
necessity. Bookchin warned of a stark choice of "anarchism or
annihilation."[^6] He asserted that the ideologies enabling
environmental destruction have their roots in social hierarchies: "We
must emphasize, here, that the idea of dominating nature has its primary
source in the domination of human by human and the structuring of the
natural world into a hierarchical Chain of Being (a static conception,
incidentally, that has no relationship to the evolution of life into
increasingly advanced forms of subjectivity and flexibility)."[^7] Thus,
Social Ecologists insist that an ecological society must be one based on
human freedom.

# Decisions

In a Social Ecological society, each neighborhood would self-govern
through a "citizen's assembly" held weekly in a public space such as a
park or auditorium. Each assembly would make decisions by majority vote
and operate according to locally-established written procedures. The
agenda for each meeting would get publicized several days in advance so
that people would have time to think about and discuss the issues.[^8]
Through confederation, citizen's assemblies would link together for
purposes such as coordinating environmental regulations and sharing
resources.

# Economy

The goal of the economy, for Bookchin, was to satisfy people's desires,
not just their needs. Thus, Bookchin advocated a society based on
*pleasure* rather than mere happiness.[^9] The Social Ecological economy
would be based on usufruct, meaning use rights. This means there would
be no permanent ownership but anyone could freely use an available
object or unused structure. The vision encompasses communism (to each
according to their needs) but arguably goes even further, with the
emphasis shifted from a fulfilment of need to a fulfilment of
desire.[^10]

Theorists of Social Ecology contend that a free society would create
"post-scarcity" conditions, with automated technologies replacing almost
all work.[^11] Due to this post-scarcity contention, Social Ecologists
reject the council-based, meticulous economic planning advocated by
theories such as Parecon.

# Environment

The Social Ecological society would harmonize human society with
ecosystems, creating a "third nature." Social Ecologists refer to wild
areas as "first nature" and human culture as "second nature."[^12]
Social Ecology seeks to build a "free nature," with human society not
only respecting but *enhancing* ecological diversity and spontaneity:
"Humanity, far from diminishing the integrity of nature, would add the
dimension of freedom, reason, and ethics to it and raise evolution to a
level of self-reflexivity that has always been latent in the emergence
of the natural world."[^13]

# Crime

A "civic milita," subordinate to the citizen's assembly, would the
neigbhorhood against both internal violent crime and external attacks.
The militia would have elected officers.[^14]

# Revolution

The basis of Social Ecologists' politics is the affinity group, a group
of close friends who theorize, organize, and reflect with other over
long periods of time. Bookchin wrote, "Autonomous, communal and directly
democratic, the \[affinity\] group combines revolutionary theory with
revolutionary lifestyle in its everyday behavior. It creates a free
space in which revolutionaries can remake themselves individually, and
also as social beings."[^15]

Social Ecologists advocate a strategy of running candidates for local
office, with a goal of eventually changing municipal law to replace
statist structures with citizen's assemblies. Ultimately, Social
Ecologists would create a giant confederation of communes. [^16]

Social Ecology has greatly influenced a number of struggles including

# Neighboring Societies

As discussed in the *Crime* section, a democratic civic milita would
replace the military and police forces.
