## Biography

Margarethe Hardegger trained as a telephone
"<a   href="switchboard_operator.md" class="wikilink"
title="switchboard operator">"switchboard operator</a> and obtained a
late *"<a   href="Matura.md" class="wikilink" title="Matura">"Matura</a>*
diploma with the support of her later husband, the lawyer August
Faas.\[1\] She had two daughters, Olga and Lisa, with Faas, whom she
married in 1903 and divorced in 1912. Since 1916 she cohabited with the
German carpenter Hans Brunner, who became her long-time companion and
later husband.\[2\]

In 1903, Hardegger co-founded the Bernese Textile Workers' Association.
In 1905, she became the first women workers' secretary of the
"<a   href="Swiss_Federation_of_Trade_Unions.md" class="wikilink"
title="Swiss Federation of Trade Unions">"Swiss Federation of Trade
Unions</a> (SGB), abandoning law school to obtain the post. She founded
several trade union sections and consumer cooperatives, as well as the
women's newspapers *Die Vorkämpferin* and *L'Exploitée* (The Exploited)
in 1907. In 1909, the active syndicalist and antimilitarist was let go
from the SGB after continued political disagreements with the union
leadership.\[1\] During her time as a labor organizer, she successfully
organized the first strike of unionized women workers in Switzerland.

After leaving the SGB, Hardegger focused on her work in the Socialist
League, which she had co-founded with Gustav Landauer in 1908, and its
magazine *The Socialist*. She campaigned for the use of contraceptives,
homosexual rights, and women's reproductive freedom, positions which
often put her at odds with both the authorities and many of her
comrades. In 1909, she was arrested in Valais for "distributing immoral
literature" related to contraception.\[2\] During her subsequent public
trial, she reportedly won over the jurors with impassioned speeches
defending women's reproductive rights.

Her support of women's rights and free love also put her at odds with
Landauer. After she was convicted of perjury on behalf of Ernst Frick in
1913, Landauer had her expelled from the Socialist League. Following her
trial for contraception advocacy, she began working with a local
abortion doctor and learned to conduct abortions herself. She also
established what has been considered the world's first abortion referral
and assistance network in Bern, procuring funds to help low-income women
access abortion services. In 1915, she was again convicted, to thirteen
months' imprisonment, for assisting in the procuration of
abortions.\[1\]

Subsequently, she principally focused on the idea of free love and
communal living. In 1919, she founded a countryside commune in
Herrliberg near Zürich that promoted principles of free love and
bisexuality, and in 1920 the phalanstère „Villino Graziella" in Minusio,
near Locarno, Ascona and the artists' colony of Monte Verità. Both
projects eventually failed because of a lack of funds and internal
disagreements.\[1\] She continued working in a family enterprise with
Hans Brunner, whom she formally married in 1950.\[2\]

## Philosophy and Activism

Hardegger was an early and outspoken advocate for women's labor rights,
reproductive freedom, homosexuality rights, and the concept of wages for
housework. In a 1907 declaration in *L'Exploitée*, she articulated her
vision of women's emancipation through class solidarity:

> "Proletarian women are women who work for any master. That her master
> is called the State, a corporation, a shareholders' company, a
> manufacturer, a boss or a husband, it doesn't matter! Whether her work
> uses a machine, her arms or her brains; whether it is considered work
> or 'an occupation expected of women because of their sex'; whether it
> is paid or not, it doesn't matter!.. Every woman and girl who works
> for someone else's profit is a proletarian woman.
>
> All proletarian women's interests lay in getting rid of the yoke or
> yokes on their shoulders. And since they do not have the strength to
> conquer individually – in isolation – they must organise, they need
> all the women interested in this emancipatory struggle to unite in
> societies and fight collectively.
>
> Women who first understood the need to fight were the factory and
> workshop workers: those who have a job. The first masters that they
> were able to perceive were their bosses, the manufacturers, the
> shareholder's companies. The first women's organisations were trade
> unions, societies to fight against their bosses, the manufacturers,
> and the shareholder's companies.
>
> During many years, in Switzerland – like in the other countries –
> workers by trade have excluded women from their corporations, hoping
> to get rid of female competition.
>
> One single condition though: all our actions must be based on the
> principle of class struggle. This means that we, proletarian women,
> have nothing in common with the women who who live off the labour of
> others. We declare war on every possible form of servitude, and a
> human society will only please us if everyone works according to their
> energy and talents, and everyone receives according to their
> needs."\[3\]

This declaration highlights her anarchist principles and her conviction
that women's liberation was inseparable from class struggle. Her vision
broadened the scope of what constituted "labor" to include domestic work
traditionally expected of women, arguing this too deserved recognition
and compensation.
