The Cathars were a Christian heresy in Western Europe that emerged in
the 11th or 12th century and flourished until the 14th century
especially in France and Italy. Their name came from the Greek word
*Katharoi* meaning "the Pure." Strongly influenced by contact with the

Cathars had a gnostic cosmology of a good God fighting against an evil
deity. A majority of the Cathars were women. The movement saw women as
equals and honored the feminine side of God known as Sophia. Women were
prominent among the spiritual leaders and among the fighters who
defended their communities from the Church's persecution. The Cathars
opposed war including the Crusades, and their religious tolerance led
Jews to find sanctuary among their French stronghold. Cathars held goods
in common, and they kept a plant-based diet because they believed
nonhuman animals were reincarnated human beings (though made an
exception for fish). Cathars permitted and perhaps even encouraged
homosexuality among ordinary members, although spiritual leaders
practiced abstinence.[^1]

With especially strong support among the peasantry, Cathars lived in
communities of 60 to 600 individuals, and the leaders, known as
*perfecti* or "perfect ones", led through example rather than command:
"Scholar Martin Erbstosser notes how 'it was the life of the perfecti
rather than the teachings of the heretics which played the key part
here' (92). The perfecti lived such blameless lives and were so eager to
be of assistance to others, they inspired devoted followers."[^2]
