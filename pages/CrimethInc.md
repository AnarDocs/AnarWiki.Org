# CrimethInc.

**CrimethInc.**, also known as the **CrimethInc Ex-Workers Collective**
or **CWC**, is a <a href="Decentralization" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a>
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
<a href="collective" class="wikilink" title="collective">collective</a>
of autonomous cells operating globally.[^1] They represent a big tent of
anarchist ideologies, allowing groups within CrimethInc. to operate with
relative autonomy while maintaining shared principles of
anti-authoritarianism and direct action. The collective has produced
numerous books, <a href="zine" class="wikilink" title="zine">zines</a>,
and other pieces of anarchist media since its formation, becoming one of
the most recognizable names in contemporary North American anarchist
publishing.

## History

### Origins

CrimethInc. emerged from the mid-1990s
<a href="hardcore_punk" class="wikilink" title="hardcore punk">hardcore
punk</a> scene, initially manifesting as the zine *Inside Front* before
evolving into a collective structure in 1996.[^2] The project grew out
of a desire to bridge the gap between punk culture and anarchist
politics, creating a platform for radical ideas that could reach beyond
traditional activist circles.

The name "CrimethInc." serves as both a reference to
<a href="George_Orwell" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">George
Orwell</a>'s concept of "<a href="thoughtcrime" class="wikilink"
title="thoughtcrime">thoughtcrime</a>" from
*<a href="Nineteen_Eighty-Four" class="wikilink"
title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>* and a satirical
commentary on the hypocrisy often found in revolutionary movements.[^3]
This self-reflexive critique has remained central to the collective's
approach, acknowledging the contradictions inherent in operating within
capitalist systems while working toward their abolition.

### Current Status

Today, CrimethInc. operates through a network of autonomous cells across
North America and internationally. The collective maintains no formal
membership structure, instead functioning as what they term "a way of
challenging all ideologies and value systems" rather than promoting any
single anarchist doctrine.[^4]

## Organisation

CrimethInc. operates on principles of
<a href="decentralization" class="wikilink"
title="decentralization">decentralization</a> and
<a href="autonomy" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>, with
individual cells and contributors maintaining independence while sharing
resources and ideas. The collective explicitly rejects hierarchical
organization, instead functioning as a loose network of affinity groups
united by shared anarchist principles.

Anyone can publish under the CrimethInc. name or utilize their visual
materials, as the collective operates under an anti-copyright philosophy
embodied in their N©!
<a href="free_license" class="wikilink" title="free license">free
license</a>.[^5] This approach extends their critique of
<a href="intellectual_property" class="wikilink"
title="intellectual property">intellectual property</a> into practice,
treating ideas as common resources rather than private property.

The collective maintains several websites operated by different cells,
most notably crimethinc.com run by the Far East Cell, which serves as a
hub for distributing propaganda, excerpts from publications, and reports
on activities from other cells around the world.

## Activities

### Publishing and Media

CrimethInc.'s core function centers on producing and distributing
anarchist propaganda through various media formats.[^6] Their most
influential publications include:

- *Days of War, Nights of Love* - a foundational text exploring
  anarchist philosophy and practice
- *Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook* - a practical guide to
  direct action tactics
- *Fighting for Our Lives* - a widely distributed pamphlet with over
  650,000 copies printed by 2010[^7]
- *To Change Everything: an Anarchist Appeal* - available in multiple
  formats including video
- *Rolling Thunder* - a semi-annual journal of anarchist thought and
  action

The collective also produces and distributes documentaries such as
*Breaking the Spell*, which documented protests against
<a href="neoliberal" class="wikilink" title="neoliberal">neoliberal</a>
trade policies, and *PickAxe*, focusing on
<a href="environmental_activism" class="wikilink"
title="environmental activism">environmental activism</a> against
logging operations.[^8]

### Direct Action and Campaigns

Various CrimethInc. cells have supported large-scale
<a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> campaigns including protests against the
<a href="Free_Trade_Area_of_the_Americas" class="wikilink"
title="Free Trade Area of the Americas">Free Trade Area of the
Americas</a> in Miami (2003) and counter-recruitment activities during
the <a href="Iraq_War" class="wikilink" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>.
The collective has promoted campaigns such as "Steal Something From Work
Day" every April 15th, coinciding with Tax Day, as a form of workplace
resistance.[^9]

Some individuals operating under the CrimethInc. banner have engaged in
more militant activities, including
<a href="Earth_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a> actions and
<a href="hacktivism" class="wikilink" title="hacktivism">hacktivism</a>
targeting government and corporate websites.[^10]

### Convergences

From 2002 to 2009, CrimethInc. hosted annual "convergences" - multi-day
gatherings featuring workshops, performances, and networking
opportunities for anarchists and other radicals. These events, held in
different cities each year, attracted hundreds of participants and
generated significant media attention.[^11]

The convergences embodied the collective's philosophy of
<a href="prefigurative_politics" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a>, creating
temporary autonomous zones where participants could experiment with
non-hierarchical organization and
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.
Activities ranged from practical skills workshops on topics like
lock-picking and <a href="permaculture" class="wikilink"
title="permaculture">permaculture</a> to theoretical discussions of
anarchist philosophy and strategy.

Following 2009, the collective shifted toward touring formats like "We
Are Everywhere" (2010) and "To Change Everything" (2015), bringing
anarchist ideas directly to communities across North America rather than
requiring people to travel to centralized gatherings.

### Music and Culture

CrimethInc. maintains strong connections to the
<a href="anarcho-punk" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-punk">anarcho-punk</a> scene, having emerged from that
milieu and continuing to support bands through their record label. They
have released music from groups including
<a href="Catharsis_(American_band)" class="wikilink"
title="Catharsis">Catharsis</a>, Zegota, and From the Depths, alongside
maintaining *Inside Front* as a journal bridging hardcore punk and
anarchist politics.

Academic Stacy Thompson has noted CrimethInc.'s role in developing "a
more contemporary and nuanced approach" to anarcho-punk that resists
commodification while maintaining accessibility.[^12]

## Philosophy

CrimethInc.'s political philosophy draws primarily from
<a href="post-left_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="post-left anarchism">post-left anarchism</a>,
<a href="situationism" class="wikilink"
title="situationism">situationism</a>, and
<a href="insurrectionary_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="insurrectionary anarchism">insurrectionary anarchism</a>. Rather
than promoting a single ideological line, the collective encourages
critical engagement with all belief systems, including anarchism itself.

### Core Principles

The collective's approach centers on what they term "crimethought" - not
a fixed ideology but rather "a way of challenging all ideologies and
value systems and lifestyles." This meta-critical stance extends to
their own work, acknowledging the contradictions inherent in
revolutionary organizing within oppressive systems.

Key themes in CrimethInc. materials include:

- **Refusal of Work** - critiquing wage labor as a form of
  <a href="alienation" class="wikilink" title="alienation">alienation</a>
  and exploring alternatives to traditional employment[^13]
- **Anti-Civilization** - questioning technological society and
  exploring more sustainable ways of living
- **Insurrection** - advocating direct confrontation with systems of
  domination rather than reform efforts
- **Individual Autonomy** - prioritizing personal freedom while
  maintaining commitment to collective struggle

### Influences

The collective draws heavily from the
<a href="Situationist_International" class="wikilink"
title="Situationist International">Situationist International</a>,
particularly their critiques of
<a href="spectacular_society" class="wikilink"
title="spectacular society">spectacular society</a> and emphasis on
creating situations that disrupt everyday life.[^14] Scholar Martin
Puchner has described them as "inheritors of the political
<a href="avant-garde" class="wikilink"
title="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>," connecting their work to
historical traditions of revolutionary cultural practice.[^15]

CrimethInc. materials frequently reference classical anarchist thinkers
while updating their ideas for contemporary contexts. They particularly
draw from <a href="individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> and
<a href="egoist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="egoist anarchism">egoist anarchism</a>, though they reject
<a href="anarcho-capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> and maintain
commitment to anti-oppression politics.

### Critiques of Democracy

Unlike many anarchists who view
<a href="direct_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> as compatible with
anarchist principles, CrimethInc. maintains a more critical stance
toward democratic processes. They argue that democracy, even in
participatory forms, can suppress individual autonomy in favor of
majority rule, potentially recreating authoritarian dynamics within
supposedly anti-authoritarian movements.

This position has generated significant debate within anarchist circles,
with critics arguing that some form of collective decision-making
remains necessary for coordinated action against oppression.[^16]

## Criticism

CrimethInc. has faced criticism from various quarters within and outside
anarchist movements:

### Academic Criticism

Some academic critics have accused the collective of promoting
<a href="lifestyle_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="lifestyle anarchism">lifestyle anarchism</a> at the expense of
serious political organizing. George MacDonald Ross has criticized their
anti-copyright stance as essentially endorsing plagiarism, though
supporters argue this misunderstands their critique of intellectual
property.[^17]

### Anarchist Criticism

Traditional anarchists have criticized CrimethInc.'s individualistic
focus as potentially undermining collective organizing efforts. Some
argue their emphasis on personal liberation can distract from systemic
analysis and coordinated resistance to oppression.

Their critique of democracy has proven particularly controversial, with
many anarchists viewing participatory democracy as essential for
maintaining egalitarian societies.

### State Repression

The collective has faced significant state surveillance and repression,
with FBI informants documented at multiple convergences between 2004 and
2008. Information gathered through this surveillance contributed to
prosecutions of environmental and anti-war activists, highlighting the
risks faced by those associated with militant anarchist organizing.[^18]

In 2021, their downtown Olympia publishing location was destroyed in a
fire, and in 2022,
<a href="Elon_Musk" class="wikilink" title="Elon Musk">Elon Musk</a>
banned their Twitter account following complaints from right-wing
influencers, which CrimethInc. characterized as politically motivated
censorship.[^19]
