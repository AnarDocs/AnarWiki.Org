# Law

## Overview

Law, in the anarchist understanding, represents one of the primary
instruments through which the state maintains hierarchical power and
suppresses human
<a href="Freedom" class="wikilink" title="freedom">freedom</a>. Rather
than embodying \[\[Antisocial Introduction\|justice\] or protecting the
vulnerable, statutory law functions as a codified system of control that
preserves existing inequalities and legitimizes state violence against
individuals and communities.

## Origins

The modern conception of law as a neutral, rational system emerged
alongside the development of the nation-state. As Alexei Borovoy noted,
the transition from feudal monarchies to representative governments
merely replaced the arbitrary rule of kings with "the rule of law" - yet
this shift concealed rather than eliminated fundamental injustices.[^1]
While presented as progress, the new legal systems continued to serve
those in power, simply clothing oppression in the language of
rationality and universal principles.

William Godwin argued that law's "tendency to crystallize what should be
modified and developed day by day" inherently conflicts with the fluid
nature of human community and changing social needs.[^2] Peter Kropotkin
called for "the destruction of state law itself," declaring "In place of
the cowardly phrase, 'Obey the law,' our cry is 'Revolt against all
laws!'"[^3]

## The Nature of State Law

### Law as Imposed Order

Unlike the spontaneous codes of conduct that emerge from genuine human
community, state law represents imposed regulation from external
authorities. As Félix Frenay observed, law constitutes "a dictate
emanating from sovereign authority" - but the critical question remains:
"dictated by what right and by what authority?"[^4]

The fundamental character of law lies in its reliance on force. True
justice, as Frenay noted, "imposes itself, and has no need, like law, to
rely on bayonets, to have an escort of gendarmes."[^5] Law represents
"imposed justice," yet "justice imposed by force ceases, by that very
fact, to be justice."[^6]

### The Crystallization of Power

Law functions to freeze existing power relations in place. As Kropotkin
recognized, legal codes exhibit "a tendency to crystallize what should
be modified and developed day by day."[^7] This crystallization serves
those who benefit from current arrangements while preventing the organic
evolution of social relations.

The proliferation of legal codes creates what Proudhon described as a
suffocating maze: "Laws and ordinances fall like hail on the poor
populace. After a while the political soil will be covered with a layer
of paper."[^8] By 1850, France's legal bulletin contained over 50,000
laws and decrees - a labyrinth in which genuine human community becomes
impossible.

### Law Versus Natural Regulation

Anarchists distinguish sharply between law and the genuine social norms
that emerge from human community. As Borovoy explained, there exist
"codes of convention" based on "collective accord" that differ
fundamentally from legal codes created by "a specialized body, detached
from society" that imposes its will "without regard to the needs of
individual human beings."[^9]

H.L.A. Hart identified "primary rules of obligation" - restrictions on
violence and positive duties to contribute to common life - that arise
from human nature itself rather than state decree.[^10] These natural
forms of regulation operate through social attitudes and mutual
understanding, not coercive enforcement.

## Law and Inequality

### Protecting Property, Not People

The vast machinery of law exists primarily to protect property relations
rather than human beings. As Jeff Ferrell notes, "Most law-enforcing is
designed to protect property, not human beings. Most crimes, by far, are
crimes against property, not against persons."[^11] In 1966, there were
120,000 offenses against persons but 1,670,000 offenses against property
in the United States.

The legal system's priorities reveal themselves through countless
examples: police shooting petty thieves while white-collar criminals
face no bodily harm; judges imposing thousand-year sentences for
stealing small amounts while corporate executives receive light
penalties for massive fraud.[^12]

### Selective Enforcement

Law enforcement demonstrates remarkable selectivity based on wealth,
race, and power. As Howard Zinn documented, "government officials have
an enormous range of choice in deciding who may and who may not violate
the law."[^13] The legal prohibition against slave importation went
unenforced while the Fugitive Slave Law received armed enforcement.
Modern examples abound: corporate violations ignored while protesters
face prosecution, wealthy defendants receiving lenient treatment while
the poor languish in jail.

This selective enforcement reveals law's true nature. As one commentator
observed regarding illegal corporate behavior: "I pay exactly what the
law asks me to pay" - yet "that don't mean shit" when the powerful can
simply ignore regulations that disadvantage them.[^14]

### Economic Machinery

Beyond criminal law, vast bodies of legislation - tax codes,
appropriations, property regulations, corporate law - function to
maintain existing economic arrangements. Law students "stagger through
courses titled Property, Contracts, Corporation Law" that constitute
"the enormous structure of law which is designed to maintain the
property system as is - and therefore the distribution of wealth as
is."[^15]

From Alexander Hamilton's economic program to modern oil depletion
allowances, legislation has consistently created "a welfare system for
the rich."[^16] The legal framework doesn't just permit inequality - it
actively produces and enforces it.

### The Legal Legitimation of Atrocity

Throughout history, legal systems have not merely failed to prevent
great injustices - they have actively authorized and enforced them. This
pattern demonstrates that legality cannot serve as a measure of morality
or justice.

**Slavery**

For millennia, slavery existed as a legally protected institution across
most civilizations. In the United States, the Constitution itself
enshrined slavery through provisions counting enslaved people as
three-fifths of a person for representation purposes and requiring the
return of escaped slaves to their "owners." The Fugitive Slave Act of
1850 made it a federal crime to assist escaped slaves, transforming the
entire legal apparatus into an instrument of human bondage.

John Locke, often celebrated as the "father" of natural rights, made a
fortune in the slave trade while theorizing about human liberty.[^17]
This contradiction reveals the true function of legal philosophy:
legitimating the interests of the powerful rather than protecting
universal rights.

**Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing**

The extermination of indigenous peoples in the Americas proceeded under
legal authorization. Treaties were signed and broken with legal
justification. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 gave legal sanction to
forced displacement that killed thousands. In Nazi Germany, the
Nuremberg Laws provided legal framework for persecution that culminated
in the Holocaust. The genocide of six million Jews occurred not in
violation of German law but in accordance with it.

As Ferrell noted, if "Natural Rights" could protect people, "the Nazis
would not have been able to murder six million Jews."[^18] Legal
protections prove worthless against state power.

**Apartheid and Segregation**

South African apartheid operated as a comprehensive legal system, with
laws dictating where people could live, work, travel, marry, and be
educated based on racial classification. In the United States, Jim Crow
laws similarly created legal frameworks for racial oppression. The
Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson decision established "separate but
equal" as constitutional doctrine, giving legal blessing to systematic
discrimination.

These were not aberrations or failures of law, but law functioning as
intended: formalizing and enforcing hierarchy and domination.

**Forced Sterilization**

Throughout the twentieth century, numerous countries legally mandated
sterilization of those deemed "unfit" - including people with
disabilities, psychiatric patients, ethnic minorities, and the poor. In
the United States, the Supreme Court's Buck v. Bell decision upheld such
laws, with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes declaring "Three generations of
imbeciles are enough." Over 60,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized
under legal authority.

**Child Labor**

For much of industrial history, children as young as five or six worked
in factories, mines, and mills under conditions that killed and maimed
thousands - all perfectly legal. When reformers sought to end child
labor, courts struck down protective legislation as unconstitutional
interference with freedom of contract. The legal system protected the
"right" of employers to exploit children.

**Marital Rape**

Until the late twentieth century, most legal systems explicitly excluded
marital rape from their definitions of sexual assault. Husbands had
legal right to force sexual relations with their wives. This legal
doctrine treated women as property rather than autonomous individuals,
demonstrating law's role in enforcing patriarchal domination.

**Environmental Destruction**

Contemporary legal systems authorize corporate destruction of ecosystems
through permits, regulatory frameworks, and property rights. Companies
legally poison water supplies, clear-cut forests, drive species to
extinction, and destabilize the climate - all within the bounds of law.
Future generations may judge this legal environmental devastation as
harshly as we judge legal slavery.

**Implications**

These examples reveal several crucial points about the nature of law:

First, legality provides no guarantee of justice. Acts that later
generations recognize as atrocities operated with full legal sanction.
Appeals to "rule of law" could not prevent these horrors because law
itself authorized them.

Second, legal systems serve those who control them. When slaveholders,
colonizers, and industrialists held power, laws protected their
interests regardless of the human cost. As power shifted, so did laws -
not because of legal principles but because of struggle and resistance.

Third, waiting for legal change means accepting ongoing atrocity. Those
who suffered under slavery, genocide, apartheid, and other legal
injustices could not wait for legislatures and courts to grant relief.
Justice required illegal resistance.

Finally, the authority granted to law itself enables atrocity. When
populations accept that law must be obeyed, that "no one is above the
law," they disable their own capacity to resist when law becomes
tyrannical. The cult of legality prepares the ground for legally
sanctioned horror.

As CrimethInc. observed, "Social change has always involved illegal
activity - from the American Revolution to John Brown's raid at Harper's
Ferry, from the sit-in movement to the uprising in Ferguson."[^19] Those
who ended legal atrocities did so by breaking the law, not by respecting
it.

## Law and Individual Autonomy

### The Myth of Obligation

The claim that individuals have an inherent obligation to obey law rests
on circular reasoning. As anarchists point out, the law decrees that no
one is above it, but this provides no rational basis for obedience. What
actually obliges us to regard laws as more valid than our own
ethics?[^20]

William Batchelder Greene argued that modern governments, founded "not
on divine right, but on prevailing might," cannot claim the moral
authority of earlier systems that at least claimed divine sanction.[^21]
When we "threw off our prejudices in favor of the divine authority of
thrones" and recognized that "actual governments are founded, not on
divine right, but on prevailing might," we eliminated any inherent duty
to obey.[^22]

### The Higher Law

Anarchists recognize a "higher law" - not divine command, but the
dictates of individual conscience and the genuine needs of human
community. As Mikhail Bakunin wrote, "I believe neither in
constitutions, nor in laws."[^23] Authentic human relations cannot be
legislated from above.

Bakunin insisted that "the liberty of man consists solely in this: that
he obeys natural laws because he has himself recognised them as such,
and not because they have been externally imposed upon him by any
extrinsic will whatever, divine or human, collective or
individual."[^24]

### Against Legal Fetishism

The elevation of law to sacred status represents what CrimethInc. calls
a "fetish" that undermines rather than protects freedom. The slogan "no
one is above the law" actually means "the law is above all of us" - that
law becomes "more valuable than our dearest desires, more righteous than
our most honorable aspirations."[^25]

This attitude "prizes group conformity over personal responsibility" and
represents "the kiss of death for any movement that aims to bring about
change."[^26] Social progress has always required illegal activity, from
revolutionary struggles to civil rights movements.

## Law and Social Control

### The State Protection Racket

Law operates as what Harold Pepinsky called a "state-protection racket,"
extracting compliance and revenue from the population through threat of
violence.[^27] From traffic fines to licensing fees to tax collection,
the state runs "a vast revenue machine, an elaborate extortion device
serving itself and those who operate it."[^28]

The enforcement apparatus - impoundment, seizure, imprisonment,
execution - functions not to protect community but to perpetuate state
power. The ideology that this occurs "in the interest of the community"
appears as cruel deception.[^29]

### Destroying Community

Legal systems actively undermine genuine human community. As Zinn
observed, law grows "in the absence of human community, and once in
place, further chokes possibilities for fluid and engaged human
interaction."[^30] People increasingly rely on police calls and civil
suits rather than direct engagement with neighbors, while the fear of
legal intrusion shadows daily life.

The reliance on state legality "reinforces the power and authority of
centralized control systems, disables the potential for human community
and human justice outside their bounds, and increasingly reduces human
interaction to a stale dichotomy of legality and illegality."[^31]

### The Spiral of Criminalization

The labeling and punishment system creates a destructive cycle. For
individuals, criminalization produces "disassociation from non-criminal
communities, constricted personal and professional identities, growing
anger and resentment, and finally an amplification of criminality and
criminal careers."[^32] For society, it weaves together "state and media
sponsored fears of crime, an ideology of state-sanctioned retaliation,
and thus broad paroxysms of objectification, dehumanization, and legal
retribution."[^33]

Rather than solving problems, the legal system perpetuates and amplifies
them - by design rather than accident.

### The Proliferation of Control

Legal regulation continually expands, penetrating more aspects of life.
In 1886, Kropotkin documented "a race of law-makers legislating without
knowing what their laws are about" - a pattern that has only
intensified.[^34] This proliferation serves multiple purposes: it
increases state power, generates revenue, and ensures that everyone
remains continually vulnerable to prosecution.

When every aspect of life becomes subject to legal control, all of us
become potentially criminal. The expansion of law transforms society
into a space where "we must choose to stand against the law."[^35]

## Law and "Democracy"

### Democratic Legitimation

Democracy serves to legitimize legal authority through the mythology of
"representation." Yet as Dora Marsden argued, "Representation of people
is an impossibility" - only interests can be represented.[^36]
Democratic processes simply accelerate "the pace at which these
alliances of the State with owners of 'interests' are put through."[^37]

The ballot box replaces the cartridge box, creating "the revolution
rendered chronic and permanent" - but this merely reorganizes rather
than eliminates domination.[^38] What autocrats call anarchy becomes
"the corner-stone of our political system,"[^39] yet the fundamental
problem of externally imposed rule remains.

### The Tyranny of the Majority

Democratic law-making concentrates power in the hands of those who can
manipulate the system. As Dr. Bones observed, human psychology makes
legislators vulnerable to influence through reciprocity, similarity, and
personal favors.[^40] A single dinner or shared interest can outweigh
the supposed will of constituents.

The reality behind democratic facade appears starkly: "your
representative, your boss, the cop down the street, will obey and work
for those they feel they owe, regardless of what the 'law' or 'the
people' might desire."[^41] The legal system becomes a gun to be pointed
by whoever can best manipulate the minds controlling it.

### Liberty as Pacification

Within democratic systems, "Liberty" functions as the companion to state
power, playing "Conscience with a task to't."[^42] While Democracy
"boldly affirms government," Liberty whispers "Don't govern" - but only
to those already weak and compliant. "Those who can govern, i.e. forward
their own interest to the detriment of those who let them, will
govern."[^43]

The rhetoric of liberty serves to pacify resistance while the powerful
continue to take what they want. It represents "the hoisting of the
white flag followed by an attempt to claim victory in virtue of
it."[^44]

## Law in Practice

### Judicial Hypocrisy

The judiciary, supposedly impartial, consists of individuals shaped by
privilege and invested in maintaining order. As Zinn documented, judges
arrive at their posts "through the most sordid corridors of local
politics, or by political appointment."[^45] Their class background,
limited social experience, and position of authority make them unlikely
champions of justice.

Examples abound: police officers acquitted for killing Black men while
someone stealing seventy-five dollars receives a thousand-year sentence;
corporate executives facing minimal consequences for deadly malfeasance
while protesters face harsh penalties.[^46]

### The Illusion of Process

Legal procedures create an appearance of fairness while systematically
disadvantaging the poor. From arrest through bail, trial, sentencing,
and parole, "the economics of justice" ensures "systematic prejudice
against the poor at every stage."[^47] Those without resources face
detention while awaiting trial, inadequate representation, harsher
sentences, and limited appeal options.

The trappings of courtroom ritual - wigs, robes, formal procedures -
serve to "dehumanize" participants and create what Herbert Read called a
"shell of custom and formality against which life, plastic and
throbbing, beats in an effort to reach the light."[^48]

### Evasion and Resistance

The powerful routinely evade laws through legal technicalities, while
the poor face rigid enforcement. As Greene illustrated, a law against
high interest rates means nothing to someone who can restructure a loan
as a business partnership.[^49] Those with resources and legal knowledge
find countless ways around restrictions that bind others.

Meanwhile, resistance by the powerless faces severe consequences. The
legal system cannot tolerate defiance from below, though it accommodates
endless manipulation from above.

## Alternatives to Law

### Spontaneous Social Codes

Anarchists advocate replacing imposed law with genuinely communal forms
of regulation. As Borovoy explained, "Genuinely collective codes, based
on the free agreement of human beings, can be correctly called anarchist
codes."[^50] These emerge from actual community needs rather than
external authority.

Such codes operate through social pressure, mutual understanding, and
collective deliberation rather than force. They remain flexible,
responsive to changing circumstances, and grounded in real human
relationships.

### Restorative Justice

Rather than state punishment, anarchists propose community-based
approaches to harm and conflict. The experience of Rojava, documented by
Robert Evans, demonstrates practical alternatives: local communes handle
disputes through "social committees" that mediate between parties,
seeking restoration of relationships rather than retribution.[^51]

When serious harm occurs, the focus shifts to healing communities and
preventing escalation rather than simply punishing individuals. This
approach recognizes that "violence is seen as a community problem as
well as an individual problem."[^52]

### Face-to-Face Justice

Larry Tifft developed an anarchist criminology advocating "a fluid,
face-to-face form of justice grounded in emerging human needs."[^53]
Rather than abstract legal principles applied by distant authorities,
justice emerges from direct engagement between affected parties.

This approach respects individual autonomy while maintaining social
connection. It allows for context, relationship, and genuine resolution
rather than bureaucratic processing.

### Decentralized Organization

Anarchist communities organize through horizontal rather than
hierarchical structures. Théodore Dézamy's proposals illustrated how
communities could coordinate without centralized legal authority, using
assemblies at various scales to address collective needs while
maintaining local autonomy.[^54]

The goal remains "the spontaneous and continuous action of the masses,
the groups and the associations of people" rather than top-down
legislation.[^55]

## Historical Examples

### The Paris Commune

The Paris Commune of 1871 demonstrated anarchist principles in practice,
creating what Bakunin called "the spontaneous and continuous action of
the masses."[^56] Though short-lived, the Commune showed that
communities could organize without traditional legal hierarchies.

### The Wobblies

The Industrial Workers of the World developed sophisticated strategies
for resisting legal authority. They used "systematic violation of unjust
laws in such great numbers as to overload courts and jails," forcing
dismissal of cases.[^57] In workplaces, they would "obey every rule and
regulation so precisely as to finally grind all work to a halt."[^58]

The Wobblies declared: "Damn the laws of the ruling class. We will have
none of them. Capitalist law and order means law forced upon the workers
by order of the capitalists."[^59]

### Rojava

Contemporary Rojava demonstrates functioning alternatives to state law.
Judge Amina explained their system: "The difference between the new
system and the regime's system is that the regime's system is a
pyramid... Our system, it's started from the society. It's emerged
between the people."[^60]

Rather than top-down legislation, communities develop practices through
horizontal organization. The maximum sentence for any crime is twenty
years, with focus on rehabilitation. Social committees mediate conflicts
to prevent cycles of violence.

## Criticism

### Against Natural Law

Some libertarian capitalists defend "natural law" as protection against
state tyranny. Anarchists reject this reasoning as another form of
authoritarianism. As Iain MacKay argued, "natural law" represents an
attempt "to elevate their opinions, dogma and prejudices to some
metaphysical level where nobody will dare to criticize it."[^61]

Such claims replace religious authority with pseudo-scientific
authority, but serve the same function: stopping thought and restricting
analysis. Real human freedom requires critical engagement, not
submission to supposedly eternal principles.

### The Limits of Reform

Reformist approaches that seek to perfect legal systems miss the
fundamental problem. As Randolph Bourne argued regarding the McNamara
case, "The sole question before us for decision" should not be "whether
these defendants did, within the meaning of \[law\], willfully take the
life" of someone.[^62] The question is whether the entire legal system
serves justice or perpetuates injustice.

Anarchists oppose "loyal opposition" to the state and legal authority.
Instead, anarchist criminology "stands as a disloyal and disrespectful
attack, a 'counterpunch to the belly of authority.'"[^63]

### Beyond Rights Discourse

The language of
"<a href="Rights" class="wikilink" title="rights">rights</a>" - whether
natural or constitutional - reinforces rather than challenges legal
authority. As CrimethInc. argued, "There are no rights without a
sovereign to bestow them."[^64] Every invocation of rights strengthens
the state's role as grantor and protector.

Freedom requires moving beyond rights to collective self-defense and
mutual aid. Rather than asking authorities to grant protections,
communities must develop their own capacity to resist domination.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Mass Incarceration

Modern legal systems demonstrate law's oppressive character through mass
imprisonment. The United States incarcerates millions,
disproportionately people of color and the poor, in conditions designed
for punishment rather than rehabilitation. This represents not a failure
of the legal system but its intended function: social control through
violence.

### Surveillance and Control

The expansion of legal regulation into digital spaces creates new forms
of control. From intellectual property restrictions to surveillance
laws, legal systems increasingly penetrate every aspect of life. This
confirms anarchist predictions about law's tendency toward totalizing
control.

### Resistance Movements

Contemporary movements continue to illustrate tensions between law and
justice. From Black Lives Matter to environmental activism, those
fighting oppression regularly face legal repression. The law protects
police who kill while prosecuting those who protest killing.

These patterns demonstrate why, as Greene argued, "The higher law, the
law written on the heart, says that the right of insurrection is
abrogated wherever the ballot box may be substituted for the cartridge
box" - yet ballot boxes have not eliminated the need for
resistance.[^65]

## Conclusion

Law represents one of the primary mechanisms through which the state
maintains domination. Far from embodying justice or protecting freedom,
legal systems serve to crystallize existing power relations, suppress
resistance, and provide ideological cover for violence and exploitation.

The anarchist critique reveals law's authoritarian essence: imposed
regulation from external authorities, divorced from genuine human
community and serving the interests of power. Whether encoded by
monarchs or legislatures, whether enforced by kings or democratic
states, law functions to restrict human freedom and preserve
hierarchical control.

Against this, anarchists advocate the replacement of legal authority
with voluntary association, restorative justice, and the organic
development of communal norms. The goal is not perfect laws or ideal
legal systems, but the abolition of law itself as a form of domination -
replaced by genuine human community based on mutual aid, direct
democracy, and respect for individual autonomy.

As Ferrell concluded: "The law is not our salvation; it is the first and
greatest crime."[^66]
