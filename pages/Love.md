# Love & Anarchism

## Overview

Love and
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a>
share a profound and necessary relationship that extends beyond simple
political philosophy into the realm of human emotion, ethics, and
revolutionary practice. Anarchism is fundamentally motivated by
love—love for humanity, for freedom, for justice, and for the
flourishing of all beings. As former British diplomat turned anarchist
Carne Ross argues, "At the heart of all anarchism is how we treat other
people."[^1] This treatment, anarchism demands, must always be
respectful and egalitarian, with no one coercing another through overt
or subtle means.

The relationship between love and anarchism operates on multiple levels:
anarchism as a political philosophy creates the conditions necessary for
authentic love to flourish; love itself embodies anarchist principles of
voluntary association, mutual aid, and the rejection of domination; and
the practice of anarchism is fundamentally an act of love toward
humanity and the world. Without love, anarchism risks becoming merely
destructive; without anarchism, love remains constrained by hierarchical
power structures that prevent its full expression.

## What Is Love?

Love, in the anarchist conception, is not merely romantic sentiment or
familial affection, but a profound recognition of another's full
humanity and autonomy. To love someone is to care so deeply for them
that their joy becomes felt by you, and even the thought of their pain
causes you suffering. It is to see someone fully as an agent unto
themselves, taking their needs as part of your own needs—not by
bulldozing your own needs in service of another's, nor by treating
another as an extension of yourself, but through recognizing the full
totality and distinctness of another while understanding yourself as not
separate from them.[^2]

This conception of love involves what might be called interbeing[^3] —
the happiness of another becomes part of your happiness; the needs of
another become part of your needs. Your happiness and theirs become
simply happiness that is experienced, and your needs and theirs become
simply needs that require meeting. Crucially, love can only be given
freely and from a place of having freedom. As Ryan Calhoun emphasizes,
"Love for yourself is not a tawdry egotism or self obsession. It is
recognition of all that makes you great, of which I assure you there is
an everlasting supply."[^4]

Love requires seeing, understanding, and caring for ourselves; seeing,
understanding, and caring for others; and being seen, understood, and
cared for. It is both an internal state and an external practice,
requiring what bell hooks describes as "an ongoing commitment to
constructive struggle and change."[^5]

## Love Under Capitalism

"<a   href="Capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Capitalism">"Capitalism</a>
fundamentally distorts and constrains love in multiple ways. Under
capitalist social relations, love becomes commodified—transformed from a
natural human emotion into something that can be bought, sold, and
exploited. Valentine's Day serves as the most obvious example, where
emotional expression becomes reduced to commercial transactions.[^6]
Dating itself becomes organized around market logic, with people
treating potential partners as commodities to be evaluated based on
their exchange value rather than their inherent worth as human beings.

Beyond direct commodification, capitalism creates material conditions
that make authentic love difficult. Economic precarity forces people
into relationships based on survival rather than genuine affection. The
necessity of selling one's labor for survival means that most people
lack the time, energy, and emotional resources to fully invest in loving
relationships. As Errico Malatesta observed, "People crushed under the
weight of current institutions; people forced to eat poorly and
threatened at every moment with falling into the deepest misery due to
lack of work or illness" find themselves unable to raise children
properly or even have the right to a family—"a bloody irony" when they
are expected to resolve questions of love before addressing their basic
material needs.[^7]

Capitalism also enforces rigid norms around relationships through
heteronormativity, homonormativity, compulsory monogamy, genderism, and
power imbalances that dictate what counts as a "real relationship."
These structures create strict unwritten guidelines that police how
people can express love, who they can love, and what forms their love
can take.[^8] Society creates relationships based on these normalized
patterns rather than on the authentic desires and needs of the
individuals involved, forcing many people into a kind of "social
suicide" where they must hide their queerness, disabilities, politics,
trauma, and true personalities merely to conform to societal
expectations.

Furthermore, capitalism breeds alienation—separation from our labor,
from the products we create, from nature, and crucially, from each
other. This alienation makes genuine human connection difficult. When
every interaction is mediated by market relations, when people are
valued primarily for their economic productivity, and when competition
is elevated above cooperation, the foundations necessary for love to
flourish are systematically undermined. Under such conditions, love
becomes a refuge from capitalism rather than a freely expressed aspect
of human life.

## Love Under Anarchism

### Love Is Anarchism

Love, by its very nature, embodies anarchist principles. Love cannot be
forced, bought, or sold; it obeys no codified hierarchy; it occurs
spontaneously and universally; and it operates according to its own
order that, to structured hierarchies, appears chaotic.[^9] These
characteristics make love intrinsically anarchist. Where capitalism and
state power depend on coercion, domination, and hierarchy, love depends
on freedom, voluntary association, and mutual recognition.

Charlotte Lowell, drawing on Judith Butler's work, argues that love
requires engaging with difference in constructive ways. Rather than
seeking to transcend or obliterate difference (which only reinstitutes
subordination), love recognizes difference as "a mobilizing and active
force that actually provides the basis for all change processes."[^10]
This dialectical understanding sees the friction that emerges when
people encounter one another not as something to avoid, but as the very
condition of possibility for growth, self-discovery, and authentic
connection. "Only then is identity given the opportunity to clarify
itself and to make its edges known. It is along these edges where we
find potential and define our priorities."[^11]

True love, as bell hooks emphasizes, requires commitment to being
changed—to being acted upon by the beloved in ways that enable fuller
self-actualization. This mirrors the anarchist commitment to constant
evolution and resistance to fixed hierarchies. Love demands that we
surrender our compulsion toward control, just as anarchism demands we
surrender our investments in domination. Both require us to trust in
processes of mutual transformation rather than unilateral imposition of
will.

### Anarchism Is Love

If love embodies anarchist principles, anarchism equally embodies love.
Carne Ross writes: "There is a word for this practice: it is love.
Without this 'spiritual' core, anarchism struggles to make sense."[^12]
Anarchism demands treating others with consideration and caring, putting
the needs of others on equal footing with our own. In its most radical
iteration, this means the erasure of self as separate from
community—having power by giving up all power, as the ancient
philosopher Lao Tzu recognized thousands of years ago.[^13]

Ryan Calhoun argues powerfully: "The most potent force to tear down
these walls which entrap us is not counter economics, propaganda by the
deed, networks of solidarity, or any organizational structure. The
sledgehammer to wield, to swing maddeningly, to obliterate the prisons
our minds persist in is love."[^14] He emphasizes that while anarchists
have no shortage of things to hate, "we must never allow our hate to
become a defining feature of our individual insurrections and
revolutionary rhetoric. Hate can help us identify the enemy, but it can
never destroy them."[^15]

Without love, attempts to dismantle oppressive systems risk merely
replacing one system of walls with another. As Calhoun notes, "what is
oppression but hatred for freedom? It is raw fear, terror and misery
which ensnare us all in some way. It is the true fuel of military
conquest, racism, xenophobia, sexism. Without hate, systems have no way
of imposing themselves on us."[^16] Therefore, anarchism must be
fundamentally grounded in love—not as naive sentimentality, but as a
fierce commitment to the dignity and freedom of all beings.

Marquis Bey conceptualizes anarchism as a "radically imaginative and
generative, creative and world-building political vision" centered on
consent, self and communal governance, direct action, dismantling
hierarchies, and global solidarity.[^17] This vision is, at its core, a
vision of a world where people can love freely, fully, and
authentically. Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin describes how in an anarchist
world, prisons, courts, and police would be replaced with "community-run
programs and centers interested solely with human regeneration and
social training"—in other words, we would encounter one another
constantly with "sincere and unwavering commitment to help each other to
achieve each of our goals of self-unfoldment. In other words, we would
encounter one another with love."[^18]

### Love Requires Consent, Anarchism Honours Consent

The relationship between love and anarchism crystallizes around the
principle of
"<a   href="consent.md" class="wikilink" title="consent">"consent</a>. Consent
is a free choice to allow something to happen—but if freedom is too
constrained, the choice no longer feels like a choice. Authentic consent
requires equitable power, which is why power matters so crucially to
both anarchism and love.[^19]

When society has entrenched power hierarchies about who is allowed to do
what and who gets to decide, there can be no authentic consent. When
people lack the option to disassociate from someone's rule if it no
longer meets their needs, consent becomes impossible. This applies
equally to political relationships and personal ones. As Anna Mercury
argues, "To call contemporary American 'democracy' a consensual social
contract is akin to saying a twelve-year-old can consent to have sex
with her teacher. This is not because We the People are children, but
because We the People are in a position of far lesser power than those
who make decisions for us."[^20]

The same logic applies to romantic and sexual relationships. Love cannot
exist in conditions of coercion or significant power imbalance. The
anarchist insistence on horizontal relationships, voluntary association,
and the right to free disassociation creates the conditions necessary
for genuine consent—and therefore genuine love—to flourish. If there is
no equality of power, there is no consent. If there is no consent, there
is inherent violence.[^21]

This understanding extends to all forms of love and relationship.
Takamure Itsue, writing in 1930, emphasized that women particularly face
this constraint: "For them, love is immensely real, leading immediately
to pregnancy and childbearing... women cannot detachedly say, 'why not
love?' when pregnancy and childbirth, the consequences of love, are
dismissed as private affairs, all the responsibilities of which are
relentlessly imposed upon frail women."[^22] Under hierarchical systems,
love becomes yet another site of exploitation and domination rather than
liberation and mutual flourishing.

Anarchism's commitment to consent, voluntary association, and the
dismantling of hierarchies creates the preconditions for love to be
expressed freely and fully. By insisting that no one should have power
over anyone else, anarchism ensures that all expressions of love emerge
from genuine desire and mutual recognition rather than coercion or
calculation.

## Free Love

The "<a   href="Free_Love.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Love">"Free Love</a>
movement has historically been intertwined with anarchist politics,
representing an application of anarchist principles to intimate and
sexual relationships. Free love advocates for the freedom to enter into
and exit from romantic and sexual relationships without interference
from the state, religious institutions, or social convention. Crucially,
it rejects the notion that love should be constrained by legal contracts
like marriage or limited to particular approved configurations.

Takamure Itsue articulated a vision of anarchist love that embraces
diverse forms and durations of connection: "We may experience ardent
love for a short while without knowing when and where, and there is no
reason to deny the freedom of realizing that love. Nevertheless, we may
have an eternal love that is both passionate and quiet, full of respect.
It will evoke a sense of 'peaceful union.' In such cases, as an
inevitable consequence of that love, we will never involve ourselves in
another love, because that is impossible."[^23] Rather than prescribing
a single model, anarchist love recognizes that different people will
have different needs and desires, and that authentic relationships can
take many forms.

However, Itsue also emphasizes that anarchist love "can never be phrased
in terms of fulfilling one's selfish interests, because it is not mere
selfish love between lovers themselves but an outgrowth of respect and
love for all people."[^24] This grounds free love in ethical
principles—not "anything goes," but rather relationships characterized
by mutual respect, honest communication, and concern for the wellbeing
of all involved.

The free love movement has broadened anarchism's understanding of love
beyond heterosexual monogamous marriage. By welcoming different
expressions of love—polyamory, relationship anarchy, queer
relationships, asexual partnerships, and more—anarchism has developed a
more expansive vision of human flourishing. This expansion reflects
anarchism's fundamental commitment to individual freedom and diversity
while maintaining ethical principles of non-coercion and mutual aid.

Story, a young queer anarcho-syndicalist, describes how anarchism has
helped develop their understanding of love beyond "heteronormativity,
homonormativity, compulsory monogamy, genderism, power imbalances, and
strict unwritten guidelines as to what counts as a 'real
relationship.'"[^25] Relationship anarchy, which applies anarchist
principles directly to intimate relationships, offers one framework for
this expansion, emphasizing that all relationships should be based on
voluntary association, mutual aid, and respect for autonomy rather than
prescribed social scripts.[^26]

## Love Without Anarchism

Without anarchism—without voluntary association, absence of domination,
freely given consent, and freedom from exploitation and
commodification—love remains profoundly constrained and distorted.
Malatesta honestly acknowledged that anarchism cannot solve all the
problems that arise from love: "We have no solution to remedy the evils
that come from love, for they cannot be destroyed by social reforms, not
even by a change of morals. They are determined by deep, we might say
physiological, human feelings."[^27]

Love will always involve vulnerability, the possibility of unrequited
feelings, jealousy, heartbreak, and loss. As Malatesta observed, "When
one loves strongly, one feels the need for contact, for the exclusive
possession of the loved one. Jealousy, understood in the best sense of
the word, seems to be, and generally is, one and the same with
love."[^28] No social system can eliminate these inherent risks and
pains of loving.

However, Malatesta argued, this is no reason to reject anarchism: "Is
this a reason not to accept our ideas and to want to remain in the
current state? This would be like someone who, unable to buy luxurious
clothes, prefers to go naked, or who, unable to eat partridges every
day, renounces bread."[^29] While anarchism cannot make love painless,
it can eliminate the additional suffering that hierarchical systems
impose on love—the economic coercion, the legal restrictions, the social
policing, the commodification, and the power imbalances that prevent
people from loving freely.

Without anarchist principles, love operates within a framework of
domination. People marry for economic security rather than affection.
They stay in relationships because leaving would mean poverty or social
ostracism. They hide who they love because society punishes
non-normative expressions. They cannot freely consent because their
choices are constrained by vast power differentials. Under such
conditions, even what appears to be love is fundamentally compromised.

Malatesta's conclusion remains relevant: "Let us eliminate the
exploitation of man by man, combat the brutal pretensions of the male
who believes himself to be the owner of the female, combat religious,
social, and sexual prejudices, ensure well-being and freedom for
all—men, women, and children—and spread education, and then we can
rightly rejoice if no evils remain other than those of love."[^30]
Anarchism may not perfect love, but it removes the social structures
that most severely constrain and distort it. In an anarchist society,
people would at least face only love's inherent challenges rather than
love's challenges plus poverty, coercion, hierarchy, and exploitation.

As Anna Mercury concludes, an anarchist society "looks like seeing,
understanding and caring for ourselves, seeing, understanding and caring
for others, and being seen, understood and cared for. In short, it looks
like love."[^31] The struggle for anarchism is inseparable from the
struggle for a world where love can flourish freely.
