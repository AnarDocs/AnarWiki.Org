# Golden Rule and Platinum Rule

## Overview

The **Golden Rule** and **Platinum Rule** represent two related but
distinct ethical principles that have significant implications for
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
theory and practice. The Golden Rule, typically formulated as "do unto
others as you would have them do unto you," has ancient roots across
multiple philosophical and religious traditions. The Platinum Rule, a
more recent reformulation stating "treat others as they wish to be
treated," represents an advancement that many anarchists argue better
captures the essence of anti-authoritarian ethics by centring the
autonomy and individuality of others rather than projecting one's own
preferences onto them.

## Origins

### The Golden Rule

The Golden Rule has existed in various forms across cultures for
millennia. The most widely recognised formulation of the Golden Rule in
Western culture derives from the teachings of Jesus in the New
Testament. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus states: "So in everything, do
to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law
and the Prophets."[^1] A similar formulation appears in the Gospel of
Luke: "Do to others as you would have them do to you."[^2]

In Western philosophy, related principles can be traced to thinkers such
as Immanuel Kant, who articulated in his *Groundwork of the Metaphysics
of Morals* that one should "act in such a way that you treat humanity,
whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the
same time as an end, never merely as a means to an end."[^3]

Eighteenth-century writers further developed related concepts about
moral character. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stated that "you can easily
judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing
for him," while Samuel Johnson offered a similar perspective: "the true
measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no
good."[^4] Although these formulations do not explicitly state the
Golden Rule, they imply its core principle by suggesting we should treat
others with equal regard regardless of whether we expect anything in
return.[^5]

Early anarchists explicitly invoked the Golden Rule as foundational to
their vision of society. In 1904, the anarchist writer H.W. described
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> as
aiming "to establish an ideal state of society based on the 'golden
rule,' in which all distinctions of castes and privileges are abolished,
and in which each individual is expected to labor spontaneously for the
welfare of himself and the community."[^6]

### The Platinum Rule

The Platinum Rule emerged as a refinement acknowledging the limitations
of the Golden Rule. While the Golden Rule assumes that others want to be
treated as we ourselves would want, the Platinum Rule recognises that
individuals have their own unique preferences, needs, and desires that
may differ substantially from our own.

Karl Popper articulated a related concept with his "Negative Golden
Rule," which states: "Do not do unto others as you would not have them
do unto you."[^7] This negative formulation shifts emphasis from
actively imposing one's preferences to refraining from unwanted
interference.

The mutualist theorist Shawn Wilbur has explored how the Golden Rule
must be understood in ways that respect individual uniqueness to be
useful for anarchist practice. Critiquing naive interpretations, Wilbur
argues: "I don't want you to treat me as if I was you, simply imposing
your preferences on me, any more than you want me to treat you as if you
were me. To do so would simply be to deny the individuality of the
other."[^8]

## Anarchist Applications

### Mutualism and Reciprocity

For mutualists, the principle of reciprocity stands at the core of
anarchist ethics. Wilbur describes mutualism as fundamentally "the
assertion that every meaningfully social relation will have the form, at
base, of an anarchic encounter between unique individuals—free
absolutes—no matter what layers of convention we pile on it."[^9] This
understanding transforms the Golden Rule from a simple prescription into
a framework for respecting individual autonomy.

When properly understood, reciprocity demands that we "treat one another
as individuals—unique individuals, with all of the emphasis that a Max
Stirner might give to that term."[^10] This interpretation aligns the
Golden Rule with "<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">individualist anarchist</a> principles
while maintaining social solidarity through mutual recognition.

William Batchelder Greene, the nineteenth-century mutualist, recognised
that competing social philosophies were simultaneously true and
false—"false as partial, exclusive systems," yet "true in their mutual
relations."[^11] Greene's work sought balance and reciprocity, avoiding
both "individualism unbalanced by socialism, and socialism unbalanced by
individualism."[^12]

### Anarchy as Love

Former British diplomat turned anarchist Carne Ross has argued that the
Platinum Rule represents a more authentically anarchist ethic than the
traditional Golden Rule. Ross explicitly rejects the Golden Rule,
arguing instead that anarchism demands "that we treat others as they
wish, not as we wish (which is, by the way, an explicit rejection of the
so-called 'golden rule', under which we treat others as we would wish to
be treated. Instead we must attend to what they say they want, not what
we think they want)."[^13]

For Ross, this principle connects anarchism to
"<a   href="Love.md" class="wikilink" title="love itself">love itself</a>: "At
the heart of all anarchism is how we treat other people. Anarchism
demands that this treatment is always respectful and egalitarian: no one
can coerce another, whether by overt means or subtle."[^14] This
understanding frames anarchism not merely as a political philosophy but
as a practice of genuine care for others' wellbeing and autonomy.

Ross identifies the core of anarchist practice as requiring
"consideration and caring, the putting of the needs of others on an
equal footing to our own."[^15] Without this ethical foundation,
anarchism loses its meaning: "Without this 'spiritual' core, anarchism
struggles to make sense."[^16]

### The Golden Mean

Roderick Long has described anarchy as "the golden mean," not a form of
extremism but rather "a middle way between mandating what should be
optional and prohibiting what should be optional."[^17] This framing
positions anarchism as the moderate position between authoritarian
extremes that either compel or forbid voluntary human activity.

David D'Amato argues that this insight reveals anarchism's essential
pluralism and tolerance for experimentation. Rather than prescribing one
particular end result, anarchism offers a methodology: "The ideal of
anarchism is a society in which all individuals can do whatever they
choose, except interfere with the ability of other individuals to do
what they choose."[^18]

From this perspective, it is statism rather than anarchism that
represents the extreme position, "espousing the facially absurd and
counterintuitive notion that some people should have the right to
arbitrarily rule all others."[^19]

## Moral Implications

The question of how we treat those who can offer us nothing in return
serves as a fundamental test of moral character and of social systems
themselves. As one contemporary anarchist writer poses: "Should any
child starve to death?" This question tests whether a society and its
members honour human dignity regardless of what individuals can
contribute.[^20]

Those who accept that hunger and homelessness are acceptable when
resources exist to address them implicitly accept a capitalist logic
that places property rights above human needs. The anarchist position,
grounded in the Platinum Rule's respect for individual dignity and
autonomy, holds that "everyone is entitled to dignity and what they need
to live."[^21]

This connects to what might be termed the **Equitarian principle**: "You
cannot achieve equilibrium in society while allowing inequality (in
people's essential needs), or if you allow inequitable power (and allow
one person to rule over another)."[^22] A just society requires both
equal access to essential resources and the elimination of hierarchical
power structures.

## Criticism

Some critics argue that the Platinum Rule places excessive burdens on
individuals to discern and accommodate others' preferences, potentially
leading to paralysis or manipulation by those who make unreasonable
demands. Others suggest that certain baseline standards of treatment
should apply universally regardless of individual preferences.

Within anarchist circles, debate continues over whether these ethical
principles can be effectively applied without some form of social
organisation to mediate conflicts between individuals' differing desires
and needs. "<a   href="Anarcho-communist.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communists">Anarcho-communists</a> and
"<a   href="Mutualist_Economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualists">mutualists</a> may differ on the institutional forms
best suited to realising reciprocal ethics in practice.

The tension between respecting individual uniqueness and maintaining
coherent social norms remains an ongoing challenge for anarchist theory,
though most anarchists would argue that
"<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">voluntary association</a> and
"<a   href="free_agreement.md" class="wikilink" title="free agreement">free
agreement</a> provide the necessary mechanisms for navigating such
tensions without recourse to authority.
