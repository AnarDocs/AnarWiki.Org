From Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works [^1]

> Even in our patriarchal society, in which everyone is conditioned to
> believe that patriarchy is natural, there has always been resistance.
> Much current resistance by queer people and transgender people takes a
> horizontal form. One organization in New York City, called FIERCE!,
> includes a wide spectrum of people excluded and oppressed by
> patriarchy: transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, two-spirit (an
> honored category in many Native American societies for people who are
> not identified as strictly men or women), queer, and questioning
> (people who have not made up their minds about their sexuality or
> gender identity, or who do not feel comfortable in any category).
> FIERCE! was founded in 2000, mostly by youth of color, and with
> anarchist participation. They uphold a horizontal ethic of “organizing
> by us, for us,” and they actively link resistance to patriarchy,
> transphobia, and homophobia with resistance to capitalism and racism.
> Their actions have included protesting police brutality against
> transgender and queer youth; education through documentary films,
> zines, and the internet; and organizing for fair healthcare and
> against gentrification, particularly where the latter threatens to
> destroy important cultural and social spaces for queer youth.
>
> At the time of this writing they are particularly active in a campaign
> to stop the gentrification of the Christopher Street Pier, which has
> been one of the only safe public spaces for homeless and low-income
> queer youth of color to meet and build community. Since 2001, the city
> has been trying to develop the Pier, and police harassment and arrests
> have multiplied. The FIERCE! campaign has helped provide a rallying
> point for those who want to save the space, and changed the public
> debate so that other voices are heard besides those of the government
> and business owners. Our society’s attitudes about gender and
> sexuality have changed radically in the past centuries, largely
> because of groups like this taking direct action to create what is
> said to be impossible.
