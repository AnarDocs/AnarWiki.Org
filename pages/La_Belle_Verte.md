# La Belle Verte

## Overview

**La Belle Verte** (*The Beautiful Green*) is a 1996 French film written
and directed by
"<a   href="Coline_Serreau.md" class="wikilink" title="Coline Serreau">Coline
Serreau</a> that presents a radical critique of capitalist modernity
through the lens of anarchist principles. The film envisions an
alternative society based on mutual aid, ecological harmony, and the
complete rejection of hierarchical structures that define contemporary
civilization.

## Anarchist Themes

### Rejection of Hierarchy

The film's central anarchist message emerges through its portrayal of
the Beautiful Green planet, where inhabitants live without rulers or
formal authority structures. As one character observes, "it is nobody
and, at the same time, everybody, who rules their planet." This reflects
the anarchist principle of "<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and collective
self-governance without coercive institutions.

The Beautiful Green society explicitly rejects the hierarchical systems
that dominate Earth. The inhabitants express bewilderment at earthlings'
"superiority complex and reliance on hierarchies," noting how "men think
they're superior to women, the people from the city to the people from
the villages, adults are better than the children, human beings are
superior to animals and plants."[^1]

### Anti-Capitalist Economics

La Belle Verte presents a fundamental critique of
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and monetary systems. The film depicts the inhabitants' bafflement at
Earth's use of money, which they view as a primitive and harmful
concept. This rejection of market economics aligns with anarchist
economics based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and voluntary cooperation.

The society on the Beautiful Green operates through gift economics,
where "everyone is a farmer and people offer their surplus production to
others in annual planetary meetings." This system eliminates
"<a   href="wage_slavery.md" class="wikilink" title="wage slavery">wage
slavery</a> and "<a   href="commodity_fetishism.md" class="wikilink"
title="commodity fetishism">commodity fetishism</a>, core concerns of
anarchist economic theory.

### Environmental Anarchism

The film advocates for what contemporary theorists might recognize as
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchism">green
anarchism</a> or "<a   href="eco-anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="eco-anarchism">eco-anarchism</a>. The Beautiful Green
civilization emerged after a period where those profiting from
environmental destruction were "judged as culprits of genocide and
crimes against the planet." The targets included "food and chemical
industries, weapon, tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical and nuclear
companies, car producers as well as architects, doctors and politicians
who got rich by allowing these companies to exist and expand."[^2]

This transformation involved mass rejection of industrial technology
through a "boycott period where people stopped buying all their
technological devices or threw away them because of their negative
health and ecological consequences."

### Voluntary Simplicity and Mutual Aid

The inhabitants of the Beautiful Green live according to principles of
"<a   href="voluntary_simplicity.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary simplicity">voluntary simplicity</a> and
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.
They "do not have beds, they sleep on the grass, in a sort of straw
nests. They bathe in lakes and their education and leisure require few
objects." This lifestyle demonstrates the anarchist belief that human
fulfillment comes through community and connection rather than material
accumulation.

## Critique of Modernity

### Alienation and Disconnection

Serreau uses the concept of "disconnection" both literally and
metaphorically throughout the film. The protagonist Mila possesses the
ability to "disconnect" earthlings from modern consciousness, revealing
their alienation from their authentic selves and from nature. This
reflects the anarchist critique of how
"<a   href="industrial_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="industrial capitalism">industrial capitalism</a> separates humans
from their essential nature and from meaningful community.

The film depicts modern Earth society as characterized by emotional
repression, environmental destruction, and social atomization - all
consequences of hierarchical, capitalist organization that anarchists
argue is fundamentally opposed to human flourishing.

### Technology and Dehumanization

La Belle Verte presents a nuanced anarchist perspective on technology,
not rejecting all technological development but criticizing its use
under capitalist conditions. The film shows how technology becomes a
tool of control and environmental destruction rather than human
liberation when organized around profit and domination.

## Anarchist Solutions

### Prefigurative Politics

The Beautiful Green society embodies
"<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a> - the
anarchist principle of creating the new world within the shell of the
old. Rather than seeking to reform existing institutions, the film
presents a complete alternative based on:

- Horizontal organization without permanent leadership
- Ecological sustainability through voluntary restraint
- Community-controlled production for use rather than profit
- Direct democracy in decision-making processes

### Revolutionary Transformation

The film suggests that transformation requires rejecting the fundamental
structures of modern civilization. As noted in the analysis, "ensuring
environmental protection and human freedom in non-capitalist ecologies
will involve the rejection of (and the creation of alternatives to) the
pillars of Western modernity."[^3]

## Contemporary Relevance

La Belle Verte anticipates many themes central to contemporary
"<a   href="eco-anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="eco-anarchism">eco-anarchism</a> and
"<a   href="post-civilization.md" class="wikilink"
title="post-civilization">post-civilization</a> movements. Its vision of
technology boycotts, rejection of urban-industrial life, and emphasis on
bioregional communities aligns with current anarchist responses to
ecological crisis.

The film's critique of "ecomodernist socialism" and technological
solutions to environmental problems reflects ongoing debates within
anarchist circles about the compatibility of industrial civilization
with ecological sustainability and human freedom.
