Ecofeminism explores the connections between the domination of women and
the domination of nature. For example, patriarchal culture denigrates
women as natural and animalistic, simultaneously reinforcing sexism and
speciesism. Moreover, patriarchal culture disempowers the women who
comprise an estimated 70 percent of the world's farmers and are
therefore best poised to understand and protect the Earth.

The term "ecofeminism" was apparently coined by Francoise D’Eaubonne in
1974[^1], although Janet Biehl says Murray Bookchin coined it.[^2]
Prominent ecofeminists have included Judi Bari, Greta Gaard, Chaia
Heller, Maria Mies, Val Plumwood, Ariel Salleh, and Vandana Shiva.
