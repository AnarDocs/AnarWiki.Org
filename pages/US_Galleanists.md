The Italian insurrectionary Anarchist Luigi Galleani founded the
newspaper *Cronaca Sovversiva* (Subversive Chronicle) in Barre, Vermont
in 1903. Published in Italian, the paper had 5,000 subscribers
concentrated in the Northeast, Midwest, and in California. Readers
formed underground groups that attempted major bombings against
capitalist and state targets, and members included Boston's famed Nicola
Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two Anarchists wrongly executed for the
murder of payroll guards. At one point, the U.S. Justice Department
declared *Cronaca Sovversiva* “the most dangerous newspaper published in
this country."[^1] *Cronaca Sovversiva* ceased publication in 1918 and
then briefly resumed publication in Italy in 1920.[^2]

There is some dispute over how to name the movement. On one hand, Peter
Gelderloos argues in *The Failure of Nonviolence* that members should
not be called "Galleanists" since "their activity predated the presence
of Galleani."[^3] On the other hand, Andrew Cornell points out that
"Galleani was treated with such reverence, and proved such a domineering
presence, that *Cronaca Sovversiva* readers were frequently called
"Galleanists" in spite of the anarchist antipathy for designating
leaders."[^4]

Unlike the "<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a>, which declined to explicitly advocate draft resistance during
World War I, followers of *Cronaca Sovversiva* organized uncompromising
and even armed opposition to the war. In September 1917, a group of
Galleani's followers tried to take down an American flag at a pro-war
rally organized by a pastor in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Police opened fire,
killing two and injuring one. One of the anarchists shot back, injuring
two officers. Eleven anarchists were arrested, and more were beaten
during a police raid the next day. Some Anarchists responded to the
police violence by planting a bomb in the pastor's church. After finding
the bomb, police took it to the police station, where it exploded. Ten
officers and one bystander died from the blast. In November, the eleven
anarchists arrested at the rally were each sentenced to twenty-five
years in prison.[^5]

In February 1919, some readers of *Cronaca Sovversiva* mailed thirty
bombs to leading industrialists and state officials. The bombs were
timed to explode on May Day. Because the senders failed to put
sufficient postage stamps on the packages, the bombs did not arrive at
their intended targets. The housekeeper of a Georgia senator lost her
hands when one of the bombs went off. On 2 June, Galleanists set off
bombs at the homes of judges and other officials in seven cities
simultaneously. None of the officials were injured, but a bomber died
when he tripped and set off a bomb that damaged the house of Attorney
General A. Mitchell Palmer.[^6] Palmer used the bombings as a pretext
for a series of raids, arrests, and deportations of socialists and
anarchists. On 19 June 1919, authorities arrested Galleani and nine
associates. They were deported to Italy five days later.[^7]

On 5 May 1920, police arrested Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
Italian-born members of a Galleani-influenced cell in Boston called
Gruppo Autonomo. They were carrying pistols and lied to police when
questioned about why they were armed. Dubiously, police charged Sacco
and Vanzetti with murdering two payroll guards during an armed robbery a
couple weeks earlier. Both Sacco and Vanzetti maintained their
innocence, and, according to a 2007 book review in the *New York Times,*
"most historians" today are "almost certain that \[Sacco and Vanzetti\]
did not commit the payroll murders."[^8]

On 16 September, Mario Buda, a friend of Sacco and Vanzetti, protested
the charges by setting off a bomb on Wall Street, outside the offices of
J.P. Morgan and the U.S. Treasury, that killed thirty-eight people. He
then fled to Italy and was never arrested.[^9] Most of the people who
died from the attack were messengers and clerks, although the bombing
also destroyed "\$2 million -- more than \$18.4 million in 2003
dollars."[^10]

Sacco and Vanzetti's prosecutors relied heavily on xenophobia and
manufactured evidence. As explained in the *Times* review:

> the prosecution paraded a motley lineup of shaky eyewitnesses, most of
> them pressured or threatened; befuddled the jury with ambiguous
> ballistics reports; browbeat the many Italian witnesses who vouched
> for the whereabouts of the defendants on the day of the murders; and,
> not least, relied on the astounding incompetence of Sacco and
> Vanzetti’s idealistic but badly overmatched lawyer.[^11]

The court case and appeals went on for seven years, as Sacco and
Vanzetti sat in jail. The two were ultimately sentenced to death. They
were electrocuted in August 1927. Sacco's wrote in his last message to
his son Dante, in English:

> So, Son, instead of crying, be strong, as as to be able to comfort
> your mother...take her for a long walk in the quiet country, gathering
> wild flowers here and there...but remember always, Dante, in the play
> of happiness, don't you use all for yourself only...help the
> persecuted and the victim because they are your better friends...In
> the struggle of life you will find more and love and you will be
> loved.[^12]

While many (or most) contemporary Anarchists reject the entirely
insurrectionary strategy of Galleani's movement, some think the
movement's deep commitment to illegal action led it to embrace resilient
underground organizational forms. In *How Nonviolence Protects the
State*, Peter Gelderloos favorably compares the underground structure of
the Galleanist movement to the more visible and formal organizing of the
IWW. The IWW's visibility made them an easier target for repression, and
raids during World War I all but killed off the organization. By
contrast, the tight-knit, secretive organizing of the Italian immigrants
may have kept them relatively safe, Gelderloos argues:

> The government undertook major efforts to repress the Italian
> anarchists, and with only partial success. Government forces killed a
> few by police action or judicial execution, and imprisoned more than a
> dozen more, but unlike the Wobblies, the Galleanists \[Gelderloos
> rejects this term in his later book *The Failure of Nonviolence*\]
> avoided being arrested en masse. This was, in part, due to the
> decentralized, security-conscious forms of organization that the
> Italians’ concept of militant revolution influenced them to
> adopt.[^13]

Gelderloos also points out that a Bureau of Investigations detective
responsible for some *Cronaca* readers' arrests, went into hiding and
then left the Bureau in 1919, due to fear of reprisal.[^14]

Andrew Cornell, while praising the movement for its resilience, also
assigns it some responsibility for prompting government repression
against other Anarchists. Cornell acknowledges that *Cronaca* readers
"formed tight-knit communities" that "proved nearly impossible for
police and government agents to infiltrate."[^15] He writes, however,
that just as nineteenth-century "propaganda of the deed" "prompted
intense, sweeping repression of anarchists,"[^16] bombings by Galleani's
followers "provided the rationale for Attorney General Palmer to order
the government's most extensive campaign of arrests, prosecutions, and
deportations of radicals to date."[^17]
