## History

### Origins

Following the <a href="Swedish_General_Strike_(1909).md" class="wikilink"
title="1909 General Strike in Sweden">1909 General Strike in Sweden</a>
(which also helped created the
<a href="Central_Organisation_of_the_Workers_of_Sweden.md" class="wikilink"
title="SAC">SAC</a>), many Swedish workers immigrated to Norway to avoid
blacklisting and arrest in
<a href="Sweden.md" class="wikilink" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. This led to
many anarcho-syndicalists living in Norway, leading to formation of
SAC-supported local organisations which fought for workers' rights.
Stonemasons created most of these organisations and people became
cynical about the use of
<a href="reformism.md" class="wikilink" title="reformism">reformism</a> and
existing
<a href="Trade_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade
unions</a>. Facing the growing competition with trade union, these local
organisations united at a conference in Oslo on the 3rd of July, 1916
and the NSF was formed.

### Harsh Early Years

The NSF became popular among stonemasons, miners and construction
workers, notably in the North. Many of the Swedish immigrants were
deported, nearly destroying the organisation as police repression
followed on Norwegian workers. It reached a peak in 1920 with 3,100
members and became relatively inactive outside of feminist causes
throughout the rest of the 1920s and 1930s. During
<a href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a>, many members were arrested and killed by the
<a href="Nazi_Germany.md" class="wikilink" title="new government">new

### Decline

After
<a href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a>, <a href="Social_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a> took hold in Norway,
causing people to move away from radical unions and into liberal ones.
One local organisation after another was dissolved, and soon the NSF
only had one member under the age of 70. They lost control of any
buildings and only met informally in private homes, with the
organisation finally dissolving in 1973.

### Reorganisation

In 1977, old veterans of the NSF and young workers reorganisated the
federation, creating a contact network and formed a new trade union. It
has begun publishing newspapers and supports strikes in Norway.[^1]
