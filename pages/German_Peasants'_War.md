> In 1524 and 1525, as many as 300,000 peasant insurgents, joined by
> townsfolk and some lesser nobility, rose up against the property
> owners and church hierarchy in a war that left about 100,000 people
> dead throughout Bavaria, Saxony, Thüringen, Schwaben, Alsace, as well
> as parts of what are now Switzerland and Austria. The princes and
> clergy of the Holy Roman Empire had been steadily increasing taxes to
> pay for rising administrative and military costs, as government became
> more top-heavy. The artesans and workers of the towns were affected by
> these taxes, but the peasants received the heaviest burden. To
> increase their power and their revenue, princes forced free peasants
> into serfdom, and resurrected Roman Civil law, which instituted
> private ownership of land, something of a step backwards from the
> feudal system in which the land was a trust between peasant and lord
> that involved rights and obligations.
>
> Meanwhile, elements of the old feudal hierarchy, such as the
> knighthood and the clergy, were becoming obsolete, and conflicted with
> other elements of the ruling class. The new burgher mercantile class,
> as well as many progressive princes, opposed the privileges of the
> clergy and the conservative structure of the Catholic church. A new,
> less centralized structure that could base power in councils in the
> towns and cities, such as the system proposed by Martin Luther, would
> allow the new political class to ascend.
>
> In the years immediately prior to the War, a number of
> "<a   href="Anabaptists.md" class="wikilink" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>
> prophets began travelling around the region espousing revolutionary
> ideas against political authority, church doctrine, and even against
> the reforms of Martin Luther. These people included Thomas Dreschel,
> Nicolas Storch, Mark Thomas Stübner, and most famously, Thomas
> Müntzer. Some of them argued for total religious freedom, the end of
> non-voluntary baptism, and the abolition of government on earth.
> Needless to say they were persecuted by Catholic authorities and by
> supporters of Luther and banned from many cities, but they continued
> to travel around Bohemia, Bavaria, and Switzerland, winning supporters
> and stoking peasant rebelliousness.
>
> In 1524, peasants and urban workers met in the Schwarzwald region of
> Germany and drafted the 12 Articles of the Black Forest, and the
> movement they created quickly spread. The articles, with Biblical
> references used as justification, called for the abolition of serfdom
> and the freedom of all people; the municipal power for people to elect
> and remove preachers; the abolition of taxes on cattle and
> inheritance; a prohibition on the privilege of the nobility to
> arbitrarily raise taxes; free access to water, hunting, fishing, and
> the forests; and the restoration of communal lands expropriated by the
> nobility. Another text printed and circulated in massive quantity by
> the insurgents was the Bundesordnung, the federal order, which
> expounded a model social order based on federated municipalities. Less
> literate elements of the movement were even more radical, as judged by
> their actions and the folklore they left behind; their goal was to
> wipe the nobility off the face of the earth and institute a mysticist
> utopia then and there.
>
> Social tension increased throughout the year, as authorities tried to
> prevent outright rebellion by suppressing rural gatherings such as
> popular festivals and weddings. In August 1524, the situation finally
> errupted at Stühlingen in the Black Forest region. A countess demanded
> that the peasants render her a special harvest on a church holiday.
> Instead the peasants refused to pay all taxes and formed an army of
> 1200 people, under the leadership of a former mercenary, Hans Müller.
> They marched to the town of Waldshut and were joined by the
> townspeople, and then marched on the castle at Stühlingen and besieged
> it. Realizing they needed some kind of military structure, they
> decided to elect their own captains, sergeants, and corporals. In
> September they defended themselves from a Hapsburg army in an
> indecisive battle, and subsequently refused to lay down their arms and
> beg pardon when entreated to do so. That autumn peasant strikes,
> refusals to pay tithes, and rebellions broke out throughout the
> region, as peasants extended their politics from individual complaints
> to a unified rejection of the feudal system as a whole.
>
> With the spring thaw of 1525, fighting resumed with a ferocity. The
> peasant armies seized cities and executed large numbers of clergy and
> nobility. But in February the Schwabian League, an alliance of
> nobility and clergy in the region, achieved a victory in Italy, where
> they had been fighting on behalf of Charles V, and were able to bring
> their troops home and devote them to crushing the peasants. Meanwhile
> Martin Luther, the burghers, and the progressive princes withdrew all
> their support and called for the annihilation of the revolutionary
> peasants; they wanted to reform the system, not to destroy it, and the
> uprising had already sufficiently destabilized the power structure.
> Finally on May 15, 1525, the main peasant army was decisively defeated
> at Frankenhausen; Müntzer and other influential leaders were seized
> and executed, and the rebellion was put down. However, over the
> following years the Anabaptist movement spread throughout Germany,
> Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and peasant revolts continued to
> break out, in the hopes that one day the church and the state would be
> destroyed for good.
