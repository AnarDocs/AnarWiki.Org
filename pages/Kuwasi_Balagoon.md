"<a   href="Black_Liberation_Army.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Liberation Army">Black Liberation Army</a> soldier, and
member of the "<a   href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>. A pioneering
theorist of "<a   href="New_Afrikan_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="New Afrikan anarchism">New Afrikan anarchism</a>, Balagoon
synthesized
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist theory">anarchist
theory</a> with "<a   href="Black_nationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black liberationist">Black liberationist</a> praxis, creating a
unique revolutionary ideology that rejected both capitalist oppression
and authoritarian socialism. As an openly bisexual Black revolutionary,
Balagoon challenged heteronormative assumptions within radical movements
while remaining committed to armed struggle against white supremacy,
capitalism, and imperialism.

## Early Life

Kuwasi Balagoon was born Donald Weems on December 22, 1946 in the
predominantly Black community of Lakeland in
"<a   href="Prince_George&#39;s_County,_Maryland.md" class="wikilink"
title="Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland">Prince George's County,
Maryland</a>. Growing up during the height of the
"<a   href="civil_rights_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="civil rights movement">civil rights movement</a>, the teenage
Weems was profoundly influenced by
"<a   href="Gloria_Richardson.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gloria Richardson">Gloria Richardson</a> and the militant
"<a   href="Cambridge_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cambridge movement">Cambridge movement</a> in Maryland, which
broke from the passive resistance model advocated by mainstream civil
rights organizations. The Cambridge movement embraced active
self-defense against white supremacist violence, culminating in the
Cambridge riot of 1963 that required National Guard intervention for
over a year.[^1]

After graduating high school, Weems enlisted in the
"<a   href="US_Army.md" class="wikilink" title="US Army">US Army</a> and was
deployed to Germany. His military service exposed him to the racism
endemic to American imperial institutions, as he and other Black
soldiers faced physical attacks and discrimination from white officers
and enlisted men. In response, Weems and other African soldiers formed a
clandestine self-defense group called "Da Legislators" that carried out
revenge attacks against racist soldiers. As Balagoon later recalled, "We
were De Judge, De Prosecutor, De Executioner, Hannibal, and De Prophet.
We said we would go to jail for a reason and not the season."[^2]

During his time in Europe, Weems visited London where he encountered
Black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean, finding the experience
of meeting Black people of diverse nationalities stimulating. This
international perspective led him to embrace a more
"<a   href="Afrocentrism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Afrocentric">Afrocentric</a> worldview that would later inform
his pan-Africanist politics.[^3]

After serving three years, mostly in Germany, Weems received an
honorable discharge in 1967 and moved to New York City where his sister
Dianne lived.[^4]

## Activism and Radicalization

### Community Organizing

Upon arriving in New York City, Weems immediately became involved in
grassroots organizing, participating in rent strikes with the Community
Council on Housing (CCOH) under the leadership of Jesse Gray. The CCOH
employed militant tactics and Black nationalist rhetoric to fight
against slumlord exploitation and appalling housing conditions faced by
poor Black communities in Harlem.[^5]

In 1967, Weems, his sister Dianne, Jesse Gray, and two other CCOH
activists traveled to Washington, D.C. and disrupted a congressional
session by bringing a cage of rats to the assembly floor to expose the
horrific conditions of urban housing. After brawling with police and
being arrested for disorderly conduct, the CCOH lost its funding and
could no longer sustain its organizing efforts.[^6][^7]

Following this, Weems joined the Central Harlem Committee for
Self-Defense, which provided material support to students occupying
buildings during the
"<a   href="Columbia_University_protests_of_1968.md" class="wikilink"
title="Columbia University protests of 1968">Columbia University
protests of 1968</a>. Around this time, Weems also became involved with
the Yoruba Temple in Harlem, led by Adefunmi, which promoted West
African traditional religion and Black nationalism. Under Adefunmi's
influence to "Africanize" all aspects of life, Weems adopted the name
**Kuwasi Balagoon**—"Kuwasi" being a Ghanaian name for a male born on
Sunday, and "Balagoon" a Yoruba name meaning "Warlord."[^8][^9]

### Joining the Black Panther Party

As the 1960s progressed, Balagoon became increasingly committed to
revolutionary politics, reading works like
*"<a   href="The_Autobiography_of_Malcolm_X.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Autobiography of Malcolm X">The Autobiography of Malcolm
X</a>*, Robert F. Williams'
*"<a   href="Negroes_with_Guns.md" class="wikilink"
title="Negroes with Guns">Negroes with Guns</a>* and his newsletter *The
Crusader*, and following
"<a   href="H._Rap_Brown.md" class="wikilink" title="H. Rap Brown">H. Rap
Brown</a> of the
"<a   href="Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee.md" class="wikilink"
title="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee">Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee</a>. These influences led Balagoon to conclude
that Black liberation could only be achieved through "protracted
"<a   href="guerrilla_warfare.md" class="wikilink"
title="guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>."[^10]

Balagoon joined the "<a   href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a> after learning of
"<a   href="Huey_Newton.md" class="wikilink" title="Huey Newton">Huey
Newton</a>'s October 1967 shootout with Oakland police. When the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Revolutionary Action Movement
established a Harlem chapter of the BPP, Balagoon quickly joined,
attracted by the Panthers' adoption of
"<a   href="Maoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Maoism">Maoism</a> and emphasis
on armed self-defense. Unlike West Coast chapters that focused on
survival programs like free breakfast initiatives, the New York chapters
emphasized tenant organizing, community takeovers of institutions like
Lincoln Hospital (in coalition with the
"<a   href="Young_Lords.md" class="wikilink" title="Young Lords">Young
Lords</a>), and building connections with the Provisional Government of
the "<a   href="Republic_of_New_Afrika.md" class="wikilink"
title="Republic of New Afrika">Republic of New Afrika</a>.[^11][^12]

## Political Prisoner

### The Panther 21 Case

In February 1969, Balagoon was arrested in New Jersey and charged with
bank robbery.[^13] Two months later, on April 2, 1969, he was indicted
along with 20 other Panther leaders and organizers on conspiracy charges
in what became known as the
"<a   href="Panther_21.md" class="wikilink" title="Panther 21">Panther 21</a>
case. The charges included conspiracy to bomb the New York Botanical
Gardens, police stations, and department stores, as well as conspiracy
to assassinate police officers—charges that were later revealed to be
part of the FBI's
"<a   href="COINTELPRO.md" class="wikilink" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>
program to destroy the Black Panther Party.[^14][^15]

While most defendants were released on bail, Balagoon was held without
bail due to the pending New Jersey charges. He and fellow Panther
"<a   href="Sekou_Odinga.md" class="wikilink" title="Sekou Odinga">Sekou
Odinga</a> were specifically accused of attempting to ambush New York
City police officers, accusations based largely on the coerced testimony
of BPP member Joan Bird, who defense attorneys alleged had been beaten
by police until she agreed to implicate them.[^16] When Odinga learned
of Bird's arrest and beating, he escaped police custody and eventually
fled to Algeria where Panther leader
"<a   href="Eldridge_Cleaver.md" class="wikilink"
title="Eldridge Cleaver">Eldridge Cleaver</a> was based.[^17]

In October 1970, while awaiting trial, Balagoon participated in
coordinated prison uprisings at both the Queens Branch House of
Detention and Brooklyn House of Detention. During the Queens rebellion,
prisoners took seven hostages and demanded better conditions and
speedier trials. Balagoon attempted to promote consensus-based
decision-making among the prisoners, but grew frustrated when he felt
other prisoners deferred too much to Black Panther leadership rather
than making collective decisions. Despite the rebellion's failure,
Balagoon viewed it as evidence that ordinary people could challenge
state power.[^18]

Balagoon's case was eventually separated from the main Panther 21 trial.
While the other 13 defendants were acquitted after two years of
imprisonment, Balagoon pleaded guilty in October 1971 to charges related
to the New Jersey bank robbery and was sentenced to 23 to 29 years.[^19]

### Ideological Evolution to Anarchism

During his imprisonment, Balagoon became profoundly disillusioned with
the authoritarian structure of the Black Panther Party. The expulsion of
popular figures like former Army Ranger
"<a   href="Geronimo_Pratt.md" class="wikilink"
title="Geronimo Pratt">Geronimo Pratt</a>—who was later proven to have
been wrongfully convicted—demoralized many New York Panthers.[^20]
Tensions between West Coast and East Coast chapters escalated over
questions of centralized leadership, whether to embrace pan-Africanism
or internationalism, and the party's increasing focus on legal defense
rather than community organizing. When the California leadership
expelled New York leaders "<a   href="Dhoruba_bin_Wahad.md" class="wikilink"
title="Dhoruba bin Wahad">Dhoruba bin Wahad</a>, Michael "Cetewayo"
Tabor, and Connie Matthews, the New York chapter officially split from
the national organization.[^21]

These events led Balagoon to critically examine hierarchical
organization itself. He later wrote: "The cadre accepted their command
regardless of what their intellect had or had not made clear to them.
The true democratic process which they were willing to die for, for the
sake of their children, they would not claim for themselves."[^22]

Groups like the "<a   href="Anarchist_Black_Cross.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist Black Cross">Anarchist Black Cross</a>—which also
influenced fellow BPP member
"<a   href="Lorenzo_Kom&#39;boa_Ervin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lorenzo Kom&#39;boa Ervin">Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin</a>—sent
Balagoon anarchist literature in prison. He studied the works of
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>,
"<a   href="Buenaventura_Durruti.md" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a>,
"<a   href="Severino_Di_Giovanni.md" class="wikilink"
title="Severino Di Giovanni">Severino Di Giovanni</a>,
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, and
"<a   href="Wilhelm_Reich.md" class="wikilink" title="Wilhelm Reich">Wilhelm
Reich</a>, seeking to apply anarchist theory to Black liberation
struggle. Goldman's concept of "free love" particularly resonated with
Balagoon, who was bisexual and rejected bourgeois sexual
norms.[^23][^24]

Balagoon came to identify as a "New Afrikan Anarchist," synthesizing
anarchism with the Republic of New Afrika's concept of Africans in
America as an internal colony. This ideological framework led him toward
the more militant "<a   href="Black_Liberation_Army.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Liberation Army">Black Liberation Army</a>, which advocated
underground guerrilla warfare against the state.[^25]

## Revolutionary Activity

### First Escape

On September 27, 1973, Balagoon escaped from prison and went underground
for approximately eight months. He was recaptured in May 1974 after
attempting to help his comrade Richard Harris escape while Harris was on
temporary leave to attend a funeral. Balagoon and Harris were wounded in
a gun battle with correctional and police officers.[^26]

Despite being imprisoned again, Balagoon continued his political
education and organizing, struggling with Marxist-Leninist and
nationalist political prisoners while recruiting members for the BLA and
politicizing other prisoners. He consistently advocated for
anti-authoritarian politics and consensus-based decision-making.[^27]

### Second Escape and Underground Activity

On May 27, 1978, Balagoon escaped from Rahway State Prison in New Jersey
for a second time, earning him the nickname "Maroon" in honor of escaped
enslaved Africans who formed autonomous communities. He joined the Black
Liberation Army underground, reconnecting with Sekou Odinga who had
returned from Africa.[^28][^29]

The BLA formed an alliance with white revolutionary groups including the
"<a   href="May_19_Communist_Organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="May 19 Communist Organization">May 19 Communist Organization</a>
and former "<a   href="Weather_Underground.md" class="wikilink"
title="Weather Underground">Weather Underground</a> members,
collectively calling themselves the Revolutionary Armed Task Force
(RATF). This coalition included Muslims, revolutionary nationalists,
communists, and Balagoon as the sole anarchist. Despite his critique of
nationalism and Marxism, Balagoon's love for his comrades and commitment
to shared principles—anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, and opposition
to white supremacy—allowed him to work in principled unity with
revolutionaries of different ideological tendencies.[^30]

The BLA wing called itself the "New Afrikan Freedom Fighters" and
organized in response to racist state violence against Black
communities, including police shootings of children and women. The RATF
conducted bank expropriations to fund the Black liberation movement and
gathered intelligence on white supremacist paramilitary groups like the
Ku Klux Klan.[^31]

### Liberation of Assata Shakur

On November 2, 1979, Balagoon participated in one of the BLA's most
successful operations: the liberation of
"<a   href="Assata_Shakur.md" class="wikilink" title="Assata Shakur">Assata
Shakur</a> from Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey.
An armed team of four BLA members, including Balagoon and Odinga, along
with two white allies from the RATF, executed a well-planned operation
that freed Shakur, who had been convicted in the 1973 killing of a New
Jersey state trooper. Shakur eventually escaped to Cuba where she
remains in exile.[^32][^33]

### 1981 Brink's Expropriation

On October 20, 1981, members of the RATF and BLA attempted to
expropriate \$1.6 million from a Brink's armored truck in Nyack, New
York. The operation resulted in a gun battle that killed two police
officers—Waverly Brown and Edward O'Grady II—and one Brink's security
guard, Peter Paige. Three white revolutionaries and one Black man were
captured at the scene. The Joint Terrorist Task Force, formed in
response to Assata Shakur's liberation, launched an intensive manhunt
that resulted in several more arrests and the death of BLA member
Mtayari Sundiata.[^34]

Balagoon was captured in January 1982. The money from this and other
expropriations funded families of political prisoners, Black liberation
movement activities, underground infrastructure, and liberation
struggles on the African continent.[^35]

## Trial and Imprisonment

Balagoon was tried alongside
"<a   href="David_Gilbert.md" class="wikilink" title="David Gilbert">David
Gilbert</a> and "<a   href="Judith_Alice_Clark.md" class="wikilink"
title="Judith Alice Clark">Judith Alice Clark</a> in July 1983. The
trial was moved from Rockland County to Orange County due to concerns
about jury impartiality. Balagoon dismissed his legal representation and
defended himself, using the courtroom as a platform to articulate New
Afrikan anarchist politics and reject the court's legitimacy. He
declared himself a prisoner of war, not a criminal, and framed the armed
struggle as justified resistance to a predatory state.[^36]

During the trial, Balagoon called Sekou Odinga as a witness. Odinga, who
had been convicted of racketeering and conspiracy but acquitted of the
robbery and murders due to double jeopardy laws, testified that he and
Balagoon had participated in the expropriation and stated that the
deaths were "justified." This was the first time any defendant had
admitted involvement in the operation.[^37]

Balagoon later claimed responsibility in a televised news segment,
stating: "Everybody who got shot that day was armed. Everybody who was
shot that day woke up that morning with the realization that they might
get shot that day."[^38]

He was convicted of murder and other charges and sentenced to life
imprisonment. Upon sentencing, Balagoon wrote: "As to the seventy-five
years in prison, I am not really worried, not only because I am in the
habit of not completing sentences or waiting on parole or any of that
nonsense but also because the State simply isn't going to last
seventy-five or even fifty years."[^39]

## Anarchist Theory and Practice

While imprisoned, Balagoon continued writing anarchist theory and
organizing fellow prisoners. His essay "Anarchy Can't Fight Alone,"
written around 1983, became a foundational text of New Afrikan
anarchism. In it, he argued:

"Of all ideologies, anarchy is the one that addresses liberty and
equalitarian relations in a realistic and ultimate fashion."[^40]

Balagoon challenged anarchists to move beyond abstract theorizing and
engage in mass organizing and armed struggle. He wrote: "We permit
people of other ideologies to define anarchy rather than bring our views
to the masses and provide models to show the contrary…In short, by not
engaging in mass organizing and delivering war to the oppressors, we
become anarchists in name only."[^41]

He insisted that anarchists must support anti-colonial struggles
regardless of whether the participants explicitly embraced anarchist
ideology: "It is beside the point whether Black, Puerto Rican, Native
American, and Chicano-Mexicano people endorse nationalism as a vehicle
for self-determination or agree with anarchism as being the only road to
self-determination. As revolutionaries we must support the will of the
masses."[^42]

Balagoon was particularly critical of authoritarian socialism, pointing
to examples like Communist China's involvement in repressing
anti-colonial struggles in Angola and South Africa. His anarchism was
explicitly anti-imperialist and internationalist, rejecting the
individualist tendencies of some European and North American
anarchists.[^43]

The title "Anarchy Can't Fight Alone" contained a double meaning:
anarchists cannot achieve liberation in isolation from other oppressed
communities, and effective revolutionary struggle requires solidarity
across ideological lines while maintaining anarchist principles of
non-hierarchy and direct action.[^44]

## Personal Life and Revolutionary Identity

Balagoon was openly bisexual at a time when radical movements were
profoundly hostile to queer people. He rejected bourgeois notions of
love and sexuality, embracing Emma Goldman's philosophy of "free love"
as part of his revolutionary practice. At the time of his final arrest,
he was captured with his transgender lover, prompting disparaging
comments from some within the movement. Even in revolutionary circles,
his sexuality was often omitted from official biographies and
obituaries, including by the New Afrikan People's
Organization.[^45][^46]

Despite facing homophobia, Balagoon earned deep respect from his
comrades through his unwavering commitment to revolutionary struggle.
"<a   href="Sekou_Odinga.md" class="wikilink" title="Sekou Odinga">Sekou
Odinga</a> remembered him as "a walking contradiction"—someone equally
ready for dangerous operations and gentle enough to be trusted as a
babysitter. Balagoon enjoyed getting high (experimenting with any drug
except heroin), listened to punk music, jazz, and rock-and-roll, and
frequented the Mudd Club in New York City. He could "basically fit into
any category" while never separating his diverse interests from the
struggle for liberation.[^47]

"<a   href="Dhoruba_bin_Wahad.md" class="wikilink"
title="Dhoruba bin Wahad">Dhoruba bin Wahad</a> recalled a powerful
memory of Balagoon during a trip through the South. When asked to "bust
a verse or two," Balagoon proclaimed: "white folks don't mind, and Black
folks don't matter."[^48]

Balagoon wrote and sketched physical training exercises that could be
performed in prison cells, distributing them to comrades to help them
"stay solid for survival." His famous phrase "repression breeds
resistance" was first articulated in his booklet "Statement of a New
Afrikan Prisoner of War."[^49]

## Death

Kuwasi Balagoon died in prison on December 13, 1986, nine days before
his 40th birthday, from pneumocystis pneumonia, an AIDS-related illness.
He was one of the first prominent political prisoners to die of AIDS,
and his death highlighted both the prison system's indifference to
prisoner health and the broader AIDS crisis devastating marginalized
communities.[^50][^51]

## Legacy

Balagoon's writings, initially distributed through anarchist prisoner
support networks in the 1980s and 1990s, have become increasingly
influential among Black anarchists and revolutionary movements. His
synthesis of anarchism with Black liberation struggle, his rejection of
both capitalist oppression and authoritarian socialism, and his
revolutionary practice as an openly queer Black militant created a
political legacy that continues to inspire contemporary anarchist
movements.[^52]

In 2019,
"<a   href="PM_Press.md" class="wikilink" title="PM Press">PM Press</a>
published *Kuwasi Balagoon: A Soldier's Story*, an expanded collection
of writings by and about Balagoon edited by Matt Meyer and Karl
Kersplebedeb, featuring contributions from
"<a   href="Sekou_Odinga.md" class="wikilink" title="Sekou Odinga">Sekou
Odinga</a>,
"<a   href="David_Gilbert.md" class="wikilink" title="David Gilbert">David
Gilbert</a>, Meg Starr,
"<a   href="Ashanti_Alston.md" class="wikilink" title="Ashanti Alston">Ashanti
Alston</a>, and other activists.[^53]

Since 2020,
"<a   href="Black_and_Pink.md" class="wikilink" title="Black and Pink">Black
and Pink</a>, a prison abolitionist organization supporting LGBTQ and
HIV-positive prisoners, has awarded the annual "Kuwasi Balagoon Award"
to people living with HIV/AIDS, honoring his revolutionary legacy and
visibility as a queer political prisoner.[^54]

Balagoon's New Afrikan anarchism demonstrated that anarchist theory
could be meaningfully applied to anti-colonial struggle, that
revolutionary movements must confront their own authoritarianism and
homophobia, and that genuine liberation requires rejecting all forms of
domination—including those reproduced within radical movements
themselves. His life exemplified the anarchist principle that
revolutionary theory means nothing without revolutionary practice, and
that love for one's people and commitment to freedom can coexist with
principled critique of nationalist and authoritarian tendencies.

As one contemporary assessment noted, unlike many anarchists who
"emphasize individuality and are arm-chair revolutionaries supporting
reactionary views on imperialism, Balagoon understood the necessity of
supporting Third World liberation struggles and had an anti-imperialist
stance noting any anarchist ideology incomplete without it."[^55]

Balagoon's revolutionary love—selfless, committed, and practiced in
solidarity with all oppressed people—remains a model for contemporary
anarchist organizing. In his own words: "Let's keep the American and
Canadian flags flying at half-mast…I refuse to believe that Direct
Action has been captured."[^56]
