# Private Property

**Private Property** or **Absentee Ownership** is a situation where one
person has the right to exclude another from a physical space or goods
without directly using or occupying that space, and is part of the basis
of
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.
Private property differs from
"<a   href="personal_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="personal property">personal property</a> (items used for
individual needs) and "<a   href="common_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="common property">common property</a> (shared resources) in that
it allows owners to extract profit from others' use of resources or
means of production.

Anarchist opposition to private property is one of the most
misunderstood aspects of anarchist theory. Contrary to popular belief,
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
does not oppose all forms of property. Rather, it distinguishes between
personal property - the things we use and inhabit - and private
property - the means of production owned exclusively to extract profit
and labour from others. This distinction forms the foundation of
anarchist economic critique and represents a fundamental divergence from
both
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and right-wing "<a   href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarianism">libertarianism</a> (sometimes called
"<a   href="Propertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Propertarianism">Propertarianism</a>).

## Types of Property

### Personal Property

**Personal property** refers to items that individuals use for their own
needs and those of their immediate family or household. This includes
homes people live in, personal belongings, tools for individual use, and
items that hold personal significance. Personal property represents a
direct relationship between people and the things they use for survival,
comfort, and self-expression.

Throughout history, even societies with communal resource management
recognised individual possession of personal items. Under most anarchist
frameworks, personal property is considered legitimate and necessary.
**No anarchist movement seeks to eliminate people's homes, personal
belongings, or the tools they use for their own work and life.** The
security and autonomy personal property provides forms an essential
component of individual freedom.

### Private Property vs Personal Property

The distinction between private and personal property is fundamental to
anarchist analysis. Private property differs fundamentally from personal
property in both nature and function. It is 'private' in the same way
private schools or private clubs are private - it excludes the many for
the privilege of the few.[^1]

**Personal property** is about use and need:

- Items you personally use and occupy
- Goods that meet your direct needs
- Property that serves your immediate household
- Tools and equipment for your own work

**Private property** is about profit and control:

- Property owned primarily to generate income from others
- Resources used to employ and control workers
- Land or buildings rented to extract profit
- Means of production owned by non-workers
- Intellectual property restricting knowledge and culture
- Infrastructure monopolised for profit extraction

Whilst personal property represents a relationship between people and
things, private property represents a relationship between people and
people, using things to extract profit or power from others. Private
property becomes the means through which humans are denied access to
resources necessary for living through the ownership claims of others.

For example, a house where you live is personal property, but a house
you rent to tenants for profit is private property. A workshop where you
make things for yourself is personal property, but a factory where you
employ others is private property.

### Usage Rights vs Ownership

Many anarchists propose **usage rights** or **possession** as an
alternative to traditional ownership models. Under usage rights systems:

- You have secure access to resources you actively use
- When you stop using something, it returns to common availability
- Rights are based on actual need and use rather than legal title
- No one can claim exclusive control over unused resources

This differs from private property ownership where:

- Legal title grants permanent control regardless of use
- Owners can exclude others even when not using resources
- Rights can be bought, sold, and inherited
- Unused property remains under owner control indefinitely

Usage rights prevent both the hoarding of unused resources and the
exploitation of others' needs, while still ensuring people have secure
access to what they personally use and need. Usage rights systems have
existed throughout human history, from indigenous stewardship to
medieval commons to modern collectives, demonstrating humans can fulfil
needs whilst preserving ecological balance without resorting to
deprivation and violence associated with exclusive private property.

## Historical Development

### Pre-Property Human Society

For most of human history, people lacked formal property concepts and
lived in networks of communes that cared for the disabled and elderly.
Hunter-gatherer societies emphasised sharing over accumulation, whilst
early agricultural communities practised collective stewardship rather
than ownership.[^2][^3]

Recent archaeological and anthropological research has challenged the
myth that pre-property humans lived cruel, short lives in isolated
tribes. Instead, evidence suggests extensive trade networks, care for
vulnerable members, and sustainable resource management without formal
ownership structures.[^4]

### Ancient Origins

Property concepts emerged gradually during the
"<a   href="Neolithic_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>, becoming
institutionalised around 3500-3000 BCE in ancient
"<a   href="Mesopotamia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Sumerian priests declared that gods
owned the land, making temples powerful economic centres. This religious
concept of sacred property established patterns that continue today:
divine origin of property rights, concentration of power in
institutions, and punishments for crossing boundaries without
permission.

### Medieval Period

During the
"<a   href="Middle_Ages.md" class="wikilink" title="Middle Ages">Middle
Ages</a>, property derived from the doctrine that land was God's
creation entrusted to earthly authorities. The
"<a   href="Catholic_Church.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> advanced the idea that kings
had divine right to dominion from God, allowing them to grant land to
lords through
"<a   href="Feudalism.md" class="wikilink" title="Feudalism">Feudalism</a>.
This system included
"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="common land">common land</a>
that belonged to everyone, though this was gradually seized through a
process called
"<a   href="enclosure.md" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">enclosure</a>.

### Modern Property Theory

As feudalism gave way to "<a   href="mercantilism.md" class="wikilink"
title="mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, British philosopher
"<a   href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>
(1632-1704) developed the labour theory of property, claiming that
property rights emerged from mixing labour with nature. However, this
theory conveniently ignored that the actual labour was typically
performed by peasants and workers, not the landowners who claimed the
rights.

Locke developed these ideas whilst investing in colonial ventures
including slavery, using his theory to justify violent conquest and
"<a   href="colonialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">colonialism</a> and the appropriation of indigenous
lands. He extended his concepts to human relationships, designating
wives, children and servants as men's 'property' - foundations that
persist in modern property, relationship and employment law.

### Proudhon's Analysis

In 1840, French economist
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> (1809-1865)
published his famous declaration that
""<a   href="property_is_theft.md" class="wikilink"
title="property is theft">property is theft</a>." This statement, often
misunderstood as attacking all property, specifically targeted private
ownership of productive resources. Proudhon distinguished between
personal property (what individuals use for themselves) and private
property (used to extract profit from others).

Proudhon's argument rested on several foundations:

**Original Common Ownership**: All natural resources originally belonged
to everyone in common, as no one created them and they were available to
all. When someone claims exclusive ownership, they effectively steal
from the commons what previously belonged to humanity collectively.

**Ongoing Theft**: Even generations after original appropriation, the
theft continues. By claiming exclusive ownership of natural resources or
means of production, owners deny others access to what was originally
common. They extract payment for using what should be freely available,
gaining power over those who need these resources to survive. His
analysis argued that private property represents ongoing theft because
it denies others access to what was originally common to all humanity.

**Stolen Labour**: Property owners leverage their position to force
others to work for them to access resources. They extract surplus value
from workers' labour, maintaining privilege through state violence and
passing accumulated wealth to heirs, perpetuating inequality across
generations.

Proudhon also declared "property is despotism," recognising that private
property grants owners power to control and coerce others. This power
extends beyond formal authority into everyday life, as workers endure
unsafe conditions, harassment or wage theft because the alternative is
destitution. The choice between submission and deprivation is no choice
at all.

### Economic Effects

Private property creates systematic economic problems:

- **Inequality**: Property ownership leads to extreme wealth
  disparities, with hardworking individuals receiving minimal
  compensation while owners collect profits without contributing labour
- **Poverty**: Ownership of essential resources allows monopolistic
  pricing, forcing people to pay inflated costs for basic necessities
  like housing and healthcare
- **Rent-seeking**: Property owners can extract wealth through their
  ownership position rather than creating genuine value

### Social and Political Consequences

Private property fundamentally alters power relationships within
society:

- **Political Corruption**: Wealthy property owners can influence
  political systems through campaign contributions, lobbying, and media
  ownership, skewing democracy toward the interests of capital
- **Hierarchy**: Property grants owners authority to control others'
  behaviour, from landlords dictating tenant conduct to employers
  controlling worker movements and speech
- **Coercion**: The threat of denying access to necessities creates
  "voluntary" arrangements that are actually made under duress

## Contemporary Issues

### Housing and Landlordism

Modern "<a   href="landlordism.md" class="wikilink"
title="landlordism">landlordism</a> exemplifies private property's
problematic nature. Landlords often purchase existing housing stock,
creating artificial scarcity that drives up prices and forces people
into rental relationships. This system:

- Prevents potential homeowners from purchasing affordable housing
- Extracts wealth from working people through rent
- Creates power imbalances between landlords and tenants
- Perpetuates cycles of poverty by preventing wealth accumulation

Research shows that when rent exceeds 32% of income,
"<a   href="homelessness.md" class="wikilink"
title="homelessness">homelessness</a> increases dramatically,
demonstrating the connection between property concentration and housing
insecurity.

### Corporate Property Concentration

Large corporations increasingly purchase residential properties as
investment vehicles, further restricting housing access for ordinary
people. This trend transforms housing from shelter into a commodity for
wealth extraction.

## Environmental Impact

Private property fundamentally reshapes humanity's relationship with the
natural world by:

- Treating ecosystems as commodities to be exploited for profit
- Prioritising short-term gains over long-term ecological health
- Breaking natural systems into privately controlled fragments
- Replacing sustainable stewardship practices with extractive
  exploitation

Indigenous communities historically maintained sustainable relationships
with land through collective stewardship rather than private ownership,
suggesting alternative approaches to resource management. Commons
management preserves ecosystems better than profit-driven extraction.

## Violence and Enforcement

Private property requires constant threat and use of force for
enforcement. Every property boundary represents potential violence
against those who would use resources for basic needs. This violence
manifests through:

- Evictions of people seeking shelter
- Criminalisation of homelessness
- Police enforcement of property boundaries
- Legal systems that prioritise property rights over human needs

The system creates structural violence where resources that could
support everyone are enclosed behind ownership barriers, forcing
artificial deprivation.

## Alternatives

Various alternatives to private property have existed throughout
history:

- **"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="Commons">Commons</a>**:
  Shared resources managed collectively by communities
- **"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Workers&#39; Self-Management">Workers' Self-Management</a>**:
  Worker ownership and control of production
- **Indigenous Stewardship**: Traditional models of collective land care
- **Public Ownership**: Democratic control of essential services and
  resources

These alternatives demonstrate that human needs can be met without the
inequality, coercion, and environmental destruction associated with
private property systems. Historical examples like
"<a   href="Revolutionary_Catalonia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a>, the
"<a   href="Zapatistas.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatistas">Zapatistas</a>,
and "<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> show
complex economies functioning without private property in means of
production.

## Relationship to Other Anarchist Concepts

Opposition to private property connects to broader anarchist principles:

- **Anti-Authoritarianism**: Private property creates hierarchy and
  domination incompatible with anarchist freedom
- **Mutual Aid**: Collective resource management enables cooperation
  over competition
- **Free Association**: Without property-based coercion, people can
  freely choose how to organise
- **Ecological Sustainability**: Commons management preserves ecosystems
  better than profit-driven extraction
- **Economic Justice**: Distribution based on need rather than ownership
  claims

title="The Tragedy of the Anticommons">The Tragedy of the
Anticommons</a>*

### Economic Efficiency Arguments

Critics, particularly "<a   href="Propertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-wing libertarians">right-wing libertarians</a>, argue
private property provides essential incentives for productivity,
innovation and efficient resource allocation. They claim historical
alternatives failed economically and that property rights protect
individual liberty.

Anarchists respond that these claims confuse personal with private
property, ignore violence inherent in property enforcement, and overlook
successful historical and contemporary commons-based systems. Innovation
and productivity exist without profit motive, as demonstrated by free
software, volunteer projects and cooperative enterprises. Private
property tends to lead to lower economic efficiency and worker
"<a   href="happiness.md" class="wikilink" title="happiness">happiness</a>
than what could be achieved via
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>.

### Practical Implementation

Critics question how societies can function without private property,
particularly regarding complex modern economies requiring large-scale
coordination.

Anarchists point to worker cooperatives, land trusts, creative commons,
and other existing alternatives that demonstrate viable models. These
systems show that complex economies can function effectively without
private ownership of productive resources.
