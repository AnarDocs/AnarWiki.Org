# Christian Anarchism

**Christian anarchism** is a movement in
<a href="political_theology.md" class="wikilink"
title="political theology">political theology</a> that claims
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> is
inherent in <a href="Christianity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and the
<a href="Gospels.md" class="wikilink" title="Gospels">Gospels</a>.[^1][^2]
It is grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority
to which Christians are ultimately answerable—the authority of God as
embodied in the teachings of
<a href="Jesus.md" class="wikilink" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. It therefore
rejects the idea that human governments have ultimate authority over
human societies. Christian anarchists denounce the
<a href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>, believing it
is violent, deceitful and
<a href="idolatrous.md" class="wikilink" title="idolatrous">idolatrous</a>.[^3]

Christian anarchists hold that the "Kingdom of God" is the proper
expression of the relationship between God and humanity. Under the
"Kingdom of God", human relationships would be characterized by
horizontal organization, <a href="servant_leadership.md" class="wikilink"
title="servant leadership">servant leadership</a>, and universal
compassion—not through the traditional structures of
<a href="organized_religion.md" class="wikilink"
title="organized religion">organized religion</a>, which most Christian
anarchists consider hierarchical or authoritarian structures.[^4] Most
Christian anarchists are also
<a href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifists">pacifists</a> who
reject war, militarism, and the use of violence.

More than any other Bible source, the
<a href="Sermon_on_the_Mount.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> is used as a basis
for Christian anarchism.[^5]
<a href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>'s
*<a href="The_Kingdom_of_God_Is_Within_You.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Kingdom of God Is Within You">The Kingdom of God Is Within

## Origins

### Old Testament

<a href="Jacques_Ellul.md" class="wikilink" title="Jacques Ellul">Jacques
Ellul</a>, a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the
final verse of the
<a href="Book_of_Judges.md" class="wikilink" title="Book of Judges">Book of
Judges</a> states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone
did as they saw fit".[^6] Subsequently, as recorded in the first Book of
Samuel, the people of Israel wanted a king "so as to be like other
nations".[^7]

The Australian Christian anarchist
<a href="Dave_Andrews.md" class="wikilink" title="Dave Andrews">Dave
Andrews</a> believes that the Israelites lived in a "decentralized
federation of tribes".[^8] Ellul describes that when important decisions
were made, a popular assembly was held, which had the final say.[^9]
Christian anarchists claim that until
<a href="Samuel.md" class="wikilink" title="Samuel">Samuel</a> the
Israelites had neither king nor central government, with God as the sole
authority. The Israelites had no taxes or rent and there was equal
access to basic resources. Israel's rallying cry was "We have no king
but Yahweh."[^10]

The American anarchist <a href="Peter_Gelderloos.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">Peter Gelderloos</a> sees a strong
decentralization during the monarchy, seeing the Kingdom of Israel not
as a state and that its intervention was minimal, dedicated only to the
battlefield and the construction of some temple.[^11]

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned
that a human king would lead to
<a href="militarism.md" class="wikilink" title="militarism">militarism</a>,
<a href="conscription.md" class="wikilink"
title="conscription">conscription</a> and punitive
<a href="taxation.md" class="wikilink" title="taxation">taxation</a>, and
that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered.
Samuel passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded
a king, and <a href="Saul.md" class="wikilink" title="Saul">Saul</a> became
their ruler. Much of the subsequent Old Testament chronicles the
Israelites trying to live with this decision.

### New Testament

More than any other Bible source, the
<a href="Sermon_on_the_Mount.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> is used as the basis
for Christian anarchism. Alexandre Christoyannopoulos explains that the
Sermon perfectly illustrates Jesus's central teaching of love and
<a href="forgiveness.md" class="wikilink"
title="forgiveness">forgiveness</a>. Christian anarchists claim that the
state, founded on violence, contravenes the Sermon and Jesus' call to
love one's enemies.

The gospels tell of Jesus's temptation in the desert. For the final
temptation, Jesus is taken up to a high mountain by Satan and told that
if he bows down to Satan he will give him all the kingdoms of the world.
Christian anarchists use this as evidence that all Earthly kingdoms and
governments are ruled by Satan, otherwise they would not be Satan's to
give.[^12] Jesus refuses the temptation, choosing to serve God instead,
implying that Jesus is aware of the corrupting nature of Earthly power.

Christian eschatology and various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques
Ellul, have identified the state and
<a href="political_power.md" class="wikilink"
title="political power">political power</a> as the Beast in the
<a href="Book_of_Revelation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>.[^13]

<a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and Frank Seaver
Billings criticized Christianity and anarchism by arguing that they are
the same thing.[^14][^15]

### Early Church

According to Alexandre Christoyannopoulos, several of the Church
Fathers' writings suggest anarchism as God's ideal. The first Christians
opposed the primacy of the state: "We must obey God as ruler rather than
men" (Acts 4:19, 5:29, 1 Corinthians 6:1-6); "Stripping the governments
and the authorities bare, he exhibited them in open public as conquered,
leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it." (Colossians
2:15).

Also, some early Christian communities appear to have practised
<a href="anarchist_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist communism">anarchist communism</a>, such as the
Jerusalem group described in Acts, who shared their money and labour
equally and fairly among the members.[^16] Roman Montero claims that
using an anthropological framework, such as that of the anarchist David
Graeber, one can plausibly reconstruct the communism of the early
Christian communities and that the practices were widespread,
long-lasting, and substantial.[^17]

Christian anarchists, such as Kevin Craig, insist that the communities
were centred on true love and care for one another, rather than
<a href="liturgy.md" class="wikilink" title="liturgy">liturgy</a>. They
also allege that the reason the early Christians were persecuted was not
that they worshipped Jesus Christ but that they refused to worship human
<a href="idolatry.md" class="wikilink" title="idols">idols</a> claiming
divine status. Since they refused to worship the Roman Emperor, they
refused to swear any <a href="oath_of_allegiance.md" class="wikilink"
title="oath of allegiance">oath of allegiance</a> to the Roman Empire.

In his introduction to a translation of the *Sayings of the Desert
Fathers*,
<a href="Thomas_Merton.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Merton">Thomas
Merton</a> describes the early monastics as "Truly in certain sense
'anarchists', and it will do no harm to think of them as such."[^18]

### Conversion of the Roman Empire

For Christian anarchists, the moment that epitomised the degeneration of
Christianity was the conversion of Emperor Constantine after his victory
at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312.[^19] Christianity was then
legalized under the Edict of Milan in 313, which hastened the Church's
transformation from a humble bottom-up
<a href="sect.md" class="wikilink" title="sect">sect</a> to an
authoritarian top-down organization. Christian anarchists point out that
this marked the beginning of the "Constantinian shift" in which
Christianity gradually came to be identified with the will of the ruling
elite by becoming the state church of the Roman Empire and in some cases
a religious justification for violence.

### Peasant Revolts in the Post-Reformation Era

Various libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work
of the English Protestant social reformer
<a href="Gerrard_Winstanley.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gerrard Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and the social
activism of his group, the
<a href="Diggers.md" class="wikilink" title="Diggers">Diggers</a>, as
anticipating their line of thought.[^20][^21]

For the anarchist historian <a href="George_Woodcock.md" class="wikilink"
title="George Woodcock">George Woodcock</a>, "Although Pierre Joseph
Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two
predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of
anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609–1676), a linen draper
who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth.
Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical
Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War
and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army
seemed intent on preserving."[^22]

In 1649–1650, the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in
southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on
the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed following a
crackdown by the English authorities, but a series of pamphlets by
Winstanley survived, of which *The New Law of Righteousness* (1649) was
the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley
equated Christ with "the universal liberty" and declared the universally
corrupting nature of authority. He saw "an equal privilege to share in
the blessing of liberty" and detected an intimate link between the
institution of property and the lack of freedom.

For <a href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>, "In the modern world,
anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry
against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman
during the Peasant Wars was
<a href="Thomas_Müntzer.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Müntzer">Thomas
Müntzer</a>; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in
the Digger movement. The concepts held by Müntzer and Winstanley were
superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when
the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the
most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world."[^23]

### Modern Era

The 19th-century Christian abolitionists
<a href="Adin_Ballou.md" class="wikilink" title="Adin Ballou">Adin
Ballou</a> and <a href="William_Lloyd_Garrison.md" class="wikilink"
title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> were critical
of all human governments and believed that they would be eventually
supplanted by a new order in which individuals are guided solely by
their love for God.[^24] Ballou and Garrison advocated Christian
nonresistance to evil, as they saw Christ as the embodiment of "passive
nonresistance", or nonviolent praxis against the state. They both
condemned violence against southern slave owners and advocated instead
for moral suasion or consistent rebukes against the institution of
slavery in efforts to persuade racist southerners and indifferent
northerners to the abolitionist cause. At the outbreak of the Civil War,
however, Garrison later embraced the armed struggle for black liberation
and the Lincoln administration. Ballou remained a lifelong pacifist and
condemned the Civil War for fear of the eventual retaliation by white
southerners on freed black Americans.

Ballou's and Garrison's writings heavily influenced
<a href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>,[^25] who was inspired by their lifelong commitment to
abolitionism. Tolstoy wrote extensively on his burgeoning Christian
anarchist principles in nonfiction books like *The Kingdom of God is
Within You*, which is considered a key Christian anarchist text. Tolstoy
sought to separate Russian Orthodox Christianity, which was merged with
the state, from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as
contained in the Gospels, specifically in the Sermon on the Mount.[^26]
He took the viewpoint that all governments that wage war and churches
that in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian
principles of nonviolence. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term
"Christian anarchism" in *The Kingdom of God Is Within You*, reviews of
the book after its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the
term.[^27]

<a href="Thomas_J._Hagerty.md" class="wikilink"
title="Thomas J. Hagerty">Thomas J. Hagerty</a>, a Marxist Catholic
priest turned oculist, was a primary author of the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) Preamble ("an injury to one is an injury to all"). IWW
members included Christian anarchists like
<a href="Dorothy_Day.md" class="wikilink" title="Dorothy Day">Dorothy
Day</a> and
<a href="Ammon_Hennacy.md" class="wikilink" title="Ammon Hennacy">Ammon
Hennacy</a>.

<a href="Dorothy_Day.md" class="wikilink" title="Dorothy Day">Dorothy
Day</a> was a journalist turned social activist who became known for her
social justice campaigns in defense of the poor. Alongside
<a href="Peter_Maurin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Maurin">Peter
Maurin</a>, she founded the <a href="Catholic_Worker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Worker">Catholic Worker</a> Movement in 1933, which
espoused nonviolence and hospitality for the impoverished and the
downtrodden.[^28] Day was declared Servant of God when a cause for
sainthood was opened for her by Pope John Paul II. Day's
<a href="distributism.md" class="wikilink"
title="distributist">distributist</a> economic views are very similar to
<a href="Proudhon.md" class="wikilink" title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>'s
<a href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">mutualism</a> by
which she was influenced.[^29] Day also named the phrase "precarious
work" based on the former anarchocommunist Léonce Crenier's embrace of
poverty.[^30]

Peter Maurin's vision to transform the social order consisted of
establishing urban houses of hospitality to care for the destitute,
rural farming communities to teach city dwellers agrarianism and
encourage a movement back to the land, and roundtable discussions in
community centres to clarify thought and initiate action.[^31]

<a href="Simone_Weil.md" class="wikilink" title="Simone Weil">Simone
Weil</a> was a French philosopher who was very early animated by a great
compassion for the exploited. She was first a socialist and then an
anarchist. In the 1930s, she converted to "love of Christ". During her
experience, she explains that she suddenly felt that Christianity was
the religion of the slaves and that she, like other slaves, could not
resist adhering to it.[^32] She is considered a "Christian mystic" and
an "anarchist Christian".[^33]

## Anarchist Biblical Views and Practices

### Church Authority

With some notable exceptions such as the Catholic Worker Movement, many
Christian anarchists are critical of Church dogma and rituals. Christian
anarchists tend to wish that Christians were less preoccupied with
performing rituals and preaching dogmatic theology, and more with
following Jesus' teaching and practices. Jacques Ellul and Dave Andrews
claim that Jesus did not intend to be the founder of an institutional
religion, while Michael Elliot believes one of Jesus' intentions was to
bypass human intermediaries and do away with priests.[^34][^35]

### Pacifism and Nonviolence

Christian anarchists, such as
<a href="David_Lipscomb.md" class="wikilink" title="David Lipscomb">David
Lipscomb</a>,
<a href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>,
<a href="Ammon_Hennacy.md" class="wikilink" title="Ammon Hennacy">Ammon
Hennacy</a>,
<a href="Jacques_Ellul.md" class="wikilink" title="Jacques Ellul">Jacques
Ellul</a>, and Dave Andrews, follow Jesus' call to not resist evil but
turn the other cheek. They argue that this teaching can only imply a
condemnation of the state, as the police and army hold a monopoly over
the legitimate use of force. They believe freedom will only be guided by
the grace of God if they show compassion to others and turn the other
cheek when confronted with violence. Christian anarchists believe
violence begets violence and the ends never justify the means.

Many Christian anarchists practice the principles of
<a href="nonviolence.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>,
<a href="nonresistance.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonresistance">nonresistance</a>, and turning the other cheek. To
illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, Alexandre
Christoyannopoulos offers the following Christian anarchist response to
terrorism:

The path shown by Jesus is a difficult one that can only be trod by true
martyrs. A "martyr," etymologically, is he who makes himself a witness
to his faith. And it is the ultimate testimony to one's faith to be
ready to put it to practice even when one's very life is threatened. But
the life to be sacrificed, it should be noted, is not the enemy's life,
but the martyr's own life—killing others is not a testimony of love, but
of anger, fear, or hatred. For Tolstoy, therefore, a true martyr to
Jesus' message would neither punish nor resist (or at least not use
violence to resist), but would strive to act from love, however hard,
whatever the likelihood of being crucified. He would patiently learn to
forgive and turn the other cheek, even at the risk of death. Such would
be the only way to eventually win the hearts and minds of the other camp
and open up the possibilities for reconciliation in the "war on
terror."[^36]

### Simple Living

Christian anarchists such as Ammon Hennacy, Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day
often advocate <a href="voluntary_poverty.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary poverty">voluntary poverty</a>. This can be for a
variety of reasons, such as withdrawing support for government by
reducing taxable income or following Jesus' teachings.[^37] Jesus
appears to teach voluntary poverty when he told his disciples, "It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:25) and "You cannot serve both God
and Mammon" (Luke 16:13).[^38]

### State Authority

The most common challenge for anarchist theologians is interpreting
Paul's Epistle to the Romans 13:1–7, in which Paul demanded obedience to
governing authorities and described them as God's servants exacting
punishment on wrongdoers. Romans 13:1–7 holds the most explicit
reference to the state in the New Testament but other parallel texts
include Titus 3:1, Hebrews 13:17 and 1 Peter 2:13-17.

Some theologians have interpreted Romans 13:1–7 to mean the Church
should support the state, as God has sanctified the state to be his main
tool to preserve social order.[^39][^40] Similarly, in the case of the
state being involved in a "just war", some theologians argue that it's
permissible for Christians to serve the state and wield the sword.
Christian anarchists do not share these interpretations of Romans 13 but
still recognize it as "a very embarrassing passage."[^41]

Christian anarchists and pacifists such as Jacques Ellul and Vernard
Eller do not attempt to overthrow the state given Romans 13 and Jesus'
command to turn the other cheek. As wrath and vengeance are contrary to
the Christian values of kindness and forgiveness, Ellul neither
supports, nor participates in, the state. Eller articulates this
position by restating the passage this way:

Be clear, any of those human authorities are where they are only because
God is allowing them to be there. They exist only at his sufferance. And
if God is willing to put up with the Roman Empire, you ought to be
willing to put up with it, too. There is no indication God has called
you to clear it out of the way or get it converted for him. You can't
fight an Empire without becoming like the Roman Empire; so you had
better leave such matters in God's hands where they belong.[^42]

Christians who interpret Romans 13 as advocating support for governing
authorities are left with the difficulty of how to act under tyrants or
dictators. Ernst Käsemann, in his *Commentary on Romans*, challenged the
mainstream Christian interpretation of the passage in light of German
Lutheran Churches using this passage to justify the Holocaust.[^43]

Paul's letter to Roman Christians declares "For rulers hold no terror
for those who do right, but for those who do wrong." However Christian
anarchists point out an inconsistency if this text were to be taken
literally and in isolation as Jesus and Paul were both executed by the
governing authorities or "rulers" even though they did "right."

There are also Christian anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Ammon
Hennacy, who favor Jesuism and do not see the need to integrate Paul's
teachings into their subversive way of life. Tolstoy believed Paul was
instrumental in the church's "deviation" from Jesus' teaching and
practices whilst Hennacy believed "Paul spoiled the message of
Christ".[^44][^45] In contrast to Eller, Hennacy and Ciaron O'Reilly
advocate nonviolent civil disobedience to confront state
oppression.[^46]

### Swearing of Oaths

In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:33-37), Jesus tells his followers
to not swear oaths in the name of God or Man. Tolstoy, Adin Ballou and
Petr Chelčický understand this to mean that Christians should never bind
themselves to any oath as they may not be able to fulfil the will of God
if they are bound to the will of a fellow-man. Tolstoy takes the view
that all oaths are evil, but especially an oath of allegiance.[^47]

### Tax

Some Christian anarchists resist taxes in the belief that their
government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities
such as war, and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities, whilst
others submit to taxation.[^48][^49] Adin Ballou wrote that if the act
of resisting taxes requires physical force to withhold what a government
tries to take, then it is important to submit to taxation. Ammon
Hennacy, who, like Ballou also believed in nonresistance, eased his
conscience by simply living below the income tax threshold.[^50]

Christian anarchists do not interpret the injunction in Matthew 22:21 to
"give to Caesar what is Caesar's" as advocating support for taxes, but
as further advice to free oneself from material attachment. For example,
Dorothy Day said if we were to give everything to God there will be
nothing left for Caesar,[^51] and Jacques Ellul believed the passage
showed that Caesar may have rights over fiat money but not things that
are made by God, as he explained:

"Render unto Caesar..." in no way divides the exercise of authority into
two realms. They were said in response to another matter: the payment of
taxes, and the coin. The mark on the coin is that of Caesar; it is the
mark of his property. Therefore give Caesar this money; it is his. It is
not a question of legitimizing taxes! It means that Caesar, having
created money, is its master. That's all. Let us not forget that money,
for Jesus, is the domain of Mammon, a satanic domain![^52]

### Vegetarianism

Vegetarianism in the Christian tradition has a long history commencing
in the first centuries of Church with the Desert Fathers and Desert
Mothers who abandoned the "world of men" for intimacy with the God of
Jesus Christ. Vegetarianism amongst hermits and Christian monastics in
the Eastern Christian and Roman Catholic traditions remains common to
this day as a means of simplifying one's life, and as a practice of
asceticism. Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, and Théodore Monod extended
their belief in nonviolence and compassion to all living beings through
vegetarianism.[^53][^54][^55]

## Present-day Christian Anarchist Groups

### Brotherhood Church

The <a href="Brotherhood_Church.md" class="wikilink"
title="Brotherhood Church">Brotherhood Church</a> is a Christian
anarchist and pacifist community. The Brotherhood Church can be traced
back to 1887 when a Congregationalist minister called John Bruce Wallace
started a magazine called *The Brotherhood* in Limavady, Northern
Ireland. An intentional community with Quaker origins has been located
at Stapleton, near Pontefract, Yorkshire, since 1921.[^56]

### Catholic Worker Movement

Established by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day in the early 1930s, the
<a href="Catholic_Worker_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Worker Movement">Catholic Worker Movement</a> is a
Christian movement dedicated to nonviolence,
<a href="personalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="personalism">personalism</a> and voluntary poverty. Over 130
Catholic Worker communities exist in the United States where "houses of
hospitality" care for the homeless. The Joe Hill House of hospitality
(which closed in 1968) in Salt Lake City, Utah featured an enormous
twelve feet by fifteen foot mural of Jesus Christ and Joe Hill.
Present-day Catholic Workers include Ciaron O'Reilly, an
Irish-Australian civil rights and anti-war activist.

Anne Klejment, professor of history at University of St. Thomas, wrote
of the Catholic Worker Movement:

The Catholic Worker considered itself a Christian anarchist movement.
All authority came from God; and the state, having by choice distanced
itself from Christian perfectionism, forfeited its ultimate authority
over the citizen. Catholic Worker anarchism followed Christ as a model
of nonviolent revolutionary behavior. He respected individual
conscience. But he also preached a prophetic message, difficult for many
of his contemporaries to embrace.[^57]

The Catholic Worker Movement has consistently protested against war and
violence for over seven decades. Many of the leading figures in the
movement have been both anarchists and pacifists, as Ammon Hennacy
explains:

Christian Anarchism is based upon the answer of Jesus to the Pharisees
when Jesus said that he without sin should be the first to cast the
stone, and upon the Sermon on the Mount which advises the return of good
for evil and the turning of the other cheek. Therefore, when we take any
part in government by voting for legislative, judicial, and executive
officials, we make these men our arm by which we cast a stone and deny
the Sermon on the Mount.

The dictionary definition of a Christian is one who follows Christ;
kind, kindly, Christ-like. Anarchism is voluntary cooperation for good,
with the right of secession. A Christian anarchist is therefore one who
turns the other cheek, overturns the tables of the moneychangers, and
does not need a cop to tell him how to behave. A Christian anarchist
does not depend upon bullets or ballots to achieve his ideal; he
achieves that ideal daily by the One-Man Revolution with which he faces
a decadent, confused, and dying world.[^58]

Maurin and Day were both baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church
and believed in the institution, thus showing it is possible to be a
Christian anarchist and still choose to remain within a church. After
her death, Day was proposed for sainthood by the Claretian Missionaries
in 1983. Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York
permission to open Day's cause for sainthood in March 2000, calling her
a Servant of God.

### Doukhobors

The
<a href="Doukhobors.md" class="wikilink" title="Doukhobors">Doukhobors</a>
are a Russian Christian anarchist sect that emerged in the 18th century.
They rejected the authority of the state and the church, refusing to
swear oaths, pay taxes, or serve in the military. Persecuted in Russia,
many emigrated to Canada in the late 19th century with the help of Leo
Tolstoy and the Quakers. They practiced communal living and pacifism,
though various splits occurred within the movement over time.

### Online Communities

Numerous Christian anarchist websites, social networking sites, forums,
electronic mailing lists and blogs have emerged on the internet over the
last few years. These include: The AnarchoChristian Podcast and Website,
Biblical Anarchy: Obey God Rather Than Men, The Libertarian Christian
Institute, started by Norman Horn, *A Pinch of Salt*, a 1980s Christian
anarchist magazine, revived in 2006 by Keith Hebden as a blog and
bi-annual magazine; Libera Catholick Union founded in 1988 and
re-organized in 2019; *Jesus Radicals* founded by Mennonites in 2000;
*Lost Religion of Jesus* created in 2005; *Christian Anarchists* created
in 2006; *The Mormon Worker*, a blog and newspaper, founded in 2007 to
promote Mormonism, anarchism and pacifism; and *Academics and Students
Interested in Religious Anarchism* (ASIRA) founded by Alexandre
Christoyannopoulos in 2008.

## Criticism

Critics of Christian anarchism include both Christians and anarchists.
Christians often cite Romans 13 as evidence that the state should be
obeyed, while secular anarchists reject belief in any authority
including God. The latter often denounce religious dogma through use of
the slogan "no gods, no masters".[^59] Christian anarchists often
believe Romans 13 is taken out of context, emphasizing that Revelation
13 and Isaiah 13, among other passages, are needed to fully understand
the meaning of Romans 13 text.[^60]

The anarchist
<a href="Luigi_Galleani.md" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Galleani">Luigi
Galleani</a> was a critic of Tolstoy, considering his philosophy an
impossible attempt at a revival of Christianity and his morality. He did
not consider Tolstoy an anarchist, despite recognizing his criticisms of
the state, the church and property, considering the defense of divine
authority contrary to anarchism. He saw Tolstoy's ideas as a theological
metaphysics based on an anti-human morality.[^61]

The British anarcho-communist
<a href="Albert_Meltzer.md" class="wikilink" title="Albert Meltzer">Albert
Meltzer</a> was also critical of Tolstoy and his pacifism. Although he
maintained that a pacifist or a Christian could be an anarchist, he
considered Christian anarchism to be synonymous with liberalism.[^62]
