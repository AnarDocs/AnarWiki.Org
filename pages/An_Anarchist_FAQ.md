# An Anarchist FAQ

*An Anarchist FAQ* is a
<a href="Frequently_asked_questions" class="wikilink"
title="FAQ">FAQ</a> written by an international working group of
<a href="Social_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="social anarchists">social anarchists</a> connected through
<a href="Internet" class="wikilink" title="Internet">Internet</a>.[^1][^2]
It documents anarchist theory and ideas and contains discussions in
favor of social anarchism.[^3][^4] It also explores other debates within
the anarchist movement and counters common arguments against anarchism.
It has been evolving continuously since 1995. Started as a critique of
<a href="Anarcho-capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>, when released it
became a general introduction to
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>.

The FAQ is published under the terms of the
<a href="GNU_Free_Documentation_License" class="wikilink"
title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation
License</a>
(<a href="copyleft" class="wikilink" title="copyleft">copyleft</a>) and
is dedicated to "*the millions of anarchists, living and dead, who have
tried and are trying to create a better world*". It was put online on
July 19, 1996 "*to celebrate the
<a href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Anarchist Revolution of 1936">Spanish Anarchist
Revolution of 1936</a> and the heroism of the Spanish anarchist
movement*".

## History

The FAQ was first published in 1995 when a group of anarchists came
together to write FAQs that would discuss and address the capitalist
claims of those who called themselves anarchists. Those involved in the
project had spent many hours in online debate with anarcho-capitalists
regarding whether
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> and
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
were compatible or not. Eventually, a group of activists decided to
write a FAQ to explain their thoughts on why anarchism and capitalism
were incompatible. While the FAQ was written by many contributors, the
main contributors are listed in the introduction as Iain McKay (primary
contributor and editor), Gary Elkin, Dave Neal, and Ed Boraas, who call
themselves *The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective*.[^5] However, the
editors eventually decided that an anarchist FAQ focused on anarchism
itself would be a better idea than one devoted exclusively to refuting
the notion of anarcho-capitalism, and thus the FAQ was born. The authors
acknowledge that "*it still bears some of the marks of its past history.
For example, it gives the likes of Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and so on,
far too much space outside of Section F — they are not that
important*".[^6] The FAQ thanks the following people for their
contributions: Andrew Flood, Mike Ballard, Francois Coquet, Jamal
Hannah, Mike Huben, Greg Alt, Chuck Munson, Pauline McCormack, Nestor
McNab, Kevin Carson, Shawn Wilbur "and our comrades on the anarchism,
oneunion and organise! mailing lists". A 2003 study by *Critical Studies
in Media Communication* declared the FAQ the most important anarchist
website, finding that it received incoming links from 20% of the
anarchist websites studied.[^7] The FAQ has been published in paperback
in two volumes by AK Press, Oakland/Edinburgh:[^8]

- Volume I: 2008, 558 pages, ISBN 9781902593906.
- Volume II: 2012; 550 pages, ISBN 9781849351225.

## Content

The FAQ editors identify themselves as belonging to the social anarchist
branch of anarchism (defined as
<a href="anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>,
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>, collectivist
anarchism, and <a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon&#39;s">Proudhon's</a>
<a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory)" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">mutualism</a>).[^9] Despite this, the FAQ presents and
describes other schools of
<a href="Individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist">anarchist</a> thought such as
<a href="Individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>,
<a href="anarcha-feminism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>, and some less known
theories like platformism and <a href="primitivism" class="wikilink"
title="primitivism">primitivism</a>. It cites references from a variety
of authors from these schools, and its bibliography contains more than
five hundred sources. According to the FAQ, anarchism is synonymous with
<a href="libertarian_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a>, free socialism,
<a href="anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communism">anarcho-communism</a>, and free
communism.[^10]

Given the wide range of anarchist ideas, the authors acknowledge that
many anarchists will not agree with everything reported in the FAQ.
However, they express their belief that "*most anarchists will agree
with most of what we present and respect those parts with which they do
not agree as genuine expressions of anarchist ideas and ideals*".[^11]

The FAQ also explains the controversies within anarchist thought, such
as where and why social anarchists and individualist anarchists
disagree.[^12] As social anarchists, the writers also explain their
views on individualist anarchism, arguing that while individualist
anarchism is certainly important it also has contradictions and "many
flaws," stating that it would lead to a "hierarchical and non-anarchist"
society.[^13] They also defend against individualist criticisms of
social anarchism, arguing that "*much of this opposition was rooted in
misunderstandings and, sometimes, in outright distortion*".[^14] The FAQ
does not accept anarcho-capitalism as part of individualist anarchism,
nor of anarchism in general. The authors of the FAQ explain and
criticize anarcho-capitalism in sections F and parts of G of the FAQ.
They state that "*outside the net \[anarcho-capitalists\] are irrelevant
and on the net they are just annoying*" and call anarcho-capitalists'
arguments "*nonsensical*".[^15] A critique of Bryan Caplan's "Anarchist
Theory FAQ" is also presented in the first appendix, along with
arguments that Caplan's FAQ distorts the relationship between anarchism
and anarcho-capitalism.[^16][^17]

## Influence and criticism

The FAQ has been endorsed by several sources. The anarcho-syndicalist
<a href="Solidarity_Federation" class="wikilink"
title="Solidarity Federation">Solidarity Federation</a> called it an
"*invaluable resource*" and "*highly recommended*" for people who wish
to "*gain a better understanding of anarchism*".[^18] Flint Jones, a
NEFAC member, hailed the FAQ as "*the most comprehensive \[anarchist\]
resource available*".[^19] The Workers Solidarity Movement, an Irish
anarchist group, called it "*the leading source of information on
anarchism on the world wide web*".[^20] Quebec anarchist Normand
Baillargeon calls it a "*monumental and essential FAQ devoted to
anarchism*".[^21] The FAQ has been cited by communication scholar Joseph
M. Reagle Jr. "\[as\] *an example of \[community governance\]
principles*".[^22] In recent years, the FAQ has been cited in various
published works, such as *Viable Utopian Ideas: Shaping a Better World*
(2003) by Arthur Shostak[^23] and *Utopia and Organization* (2002) by
Martin Parker.[^24] It has been described as "*very comprehensive*" by
Paul Graham and John Hoffman in their *Introduction to Political
Ideologies* (2006).[^25] Various versions of the FAQ have been
translated into eight languages and it has been included in every stable
release of <a href="Debian" class="wikilink" title="Debian">Debian</a>
since 1999.[^26][^27]

An earlier version of the FAQ was once criticized by one of the
anarcho-capitalists it was written to oppose. Writing in 1997 and
referring to the 1996 version of the FAQ,
<a href="David_Friedman" class="wikilink"
title="David D. Friedman">David D. Friedman</a> complained about what he
called the authors' "*irresponsibility*" in making errors in their
account of Icelandic history and attributing to him a position he did
not hold. The authors corrected their error in Friedman's view in later
versions when they became aware of his criticisms.[^28] While
acknowledging that the 1996 version of the FAQ contained some errors
regarding medieval Iceland and was poorly referenced, they denied that
this represented a "disregard for the truth" and argue that their
critique was still valid despite "some serious errors in details".[^29]

title="A New Anarchist FAQ">A New Anarchist FAQ</a>**, launched on
<a href="Raddle" class="wikilink" title="raddle.me">raddle.me</a> by
post-left anarchists, emerged as a direct response to what its creators
view as significant ideological biases within
<a href="An_Anarchist_FAQ" class="wikilink" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An
Anarchist FAQ</a>. Critics argue that the original FAQ, being largely
written by a single author, promotes a "strong Bookchinite perspective"
while engaging in "bad faith attacks against certain anarchist
tendencies like
<a href="Green_Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="green anarchy">green
anarchy</a>" and excessively promoting democratic organizing methods and
workplace-centered approaches to anarchism.
