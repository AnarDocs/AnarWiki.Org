# Open Borders

**Open Borders** refers to the abolition of state-imposed restrictions
on human movement across territorial boundaries. This encompasses the
elimination of visas, passports, checkpoints, bureaucratic controls, and
all forms of surveillance apparatus designed to regulate migration. From
an anarchist perspective, open borders represents not merely a policy
reform but a fundamental challenge to state sovereignty and nationalist
ideology.

## Overview

Open borders stands in direct opposition to the modern nation-state
system, which relies on territorial control and population management as
core functions of state power. While liberal advocates may frame open
borders as a humanitarian reform or economic policy, anarchists
recognize it as incompatible with state power itself - borders exist to
define and maintain state authority, making their abolition inherently
revolutionary.

The concept extends beyond simple policy change to encompass freedom of
movement as a fundamental aspect of human autonomy. Rather than treating
migration as a right granted or denied by states, open borders
acknowledges movement as an intrinsic human capacity that precedes and
supersedes state authority.

## History

*See Also: <a href="History_of_Borders" class="wikilink"
title="History of Borders">History of Borders</a>*

For most of human history, the modern conception of borders with
checkpoints, documentation requirements, and systematic population
control did not exist. Forager communities moved freely across
territories, and even in agricultural societies, movement was typically
restricted by practical considerations of distance and resources rather
than state-imposed barriers.

The consolidation of border controls represents a relatively recent
development in human history. The US-Mexican border, for instance,
remained largely unmonitored until the 1870s, with systematic
enforcement only emerging in the 20th century. Similarly, passport
systems as we know them today were largely standardized during and after
World War I as states sought greater control over population movements.

### Contemporary Examples

The
<a href="Schengen_Area" class="wikilink" title="Schengen Area">Schengen
Area</a> represents the largest modern experiment in open borders,
established by the <a href="European_Union" class="wikilink"
title="European Union">European Union</a> in 1995. At its peak, it
allowed approximately 420 million people to travel freely across member
states from
<a href="Portugal" class="wikilink" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> to
<a href="Finland" class="wikilink" title="Finland">Finland</a> without
border checks. However, this arrangement has faced increasing
restrictions since 2015, with many internal borders being temporarily or
permanently reinstated, and the system effectively collapsed during the
<a href="Coronavirus_Pandemic" class="wikilink"

The borders between states within the United States provide another
example, where citizens can travel freely from California to Florida
without documentation or checkpoints, demonstrating that large-scale
free movement zones can function without systematic border enforcement.

## Anarchist Analysis

### Borders and State Power

From an anarchist perspective, borders serve multiple functions
essential to state power. They demarcate territories over which states
claim monopolistic authority, they control labor flows to serve
capitalist interests, they construct artificial divisions between
working people, and they provide justification for nationalist ideology
that obscures class antagonisms.

The monitoring and policing of borders requires extensive apparatus of
violence, surveillance, detention, and deportation. This infrastructure
exists not primarily to "protect" populations but to maintain state
control over movement and to discipline labor markets. The violence
inherent in border enforcement - from detention centers to border patrol
killings to deaths in deserts and seas - reveals the coercive nature of
state sovereignty.

### Nationalism and Moral Understanding

Borders produce and reinforce nationalist ideology, which encourages
people to believe their moral obligations end at national boundaries.
This artificial division obscures the common interests of working people
across borders while serving elite interests in maintaining separate
labor markets and preventing international solidarity.

Nationalism, even in its "patriotic" rather than chauvinistic forms,
frames moral questions through the lens of national identity rather than
human needs and ethical principles. When someone supports "British
values" of tolerance, they are not actually supporting tolerance itself
but rather attaching it to a nationalist framework that inherently
creates divisions between peoples.

The heterogeneity of human cultures and communities requires no borders
to exist or flourish. Cultural practices, languages, and ways of life
develop through organic human interaction, not through state-imposed
divisions. Borders artificially freeze and enforce cultural boundaries
that would otherwise remain fluid and evolving.

### Freedom of Movement and Human Flourishing

Human autonomy and flourishing require the freedom to live where one
chooses, to associate with whom one chooses, and to move freely in
pursuit of one's needs and desires. Constraints on movement - whether
through lack of water, food, shelter, or education, or through
state-imposed barriers - prevent humans from actualizing their
potential.

The inability to move freely constitutes a fundamental constraint on
human agency. If someone cannot live where they want, meet whom they
want to meet, or go where they want to go, their capacity for
self-determination is diminished. An unfulfilled life resulting from
such constraints represents both individual tragedy and collective
failure.

## The No Borders Movement

The contemporary No Borders movement emerged from anarchist organizing
in Europe, particularly focused on supporting migrants and challenging
border enforcement. Rather than merely advocating for policy reform, No
Borders activists engage in direct action to undermine border regimes
and create infrastructure for free movement.

### Practical Resistance

The No Borders movement draws inspiration from historical examples of
resistance to control systems, such as the underground railroad that
helped enslaved people escape in 19th century America, and anti-Nazi
resistance networks in 20th century Europe. The goal is not symbolic
protest but material results - stopping deportations, helping people
cross borders, providing shelter and resources, and creating networks of
solidarity.

This work involves creating infrastructure of resistance including
contacts, information networks, meeting points, drop-in centers, safe
houses, and formal and informal connections. These networks operate on
both public and clandestine levels, recognizing that effective
resistance requires both visible organizing and covert support systems.

### Principles of Action

No Borders organizing emphasizes direct action that achieves concrete
material outcomes rather than symbolic gestures aimed at media attention
or "public opinion." Every action should have measurable success -
stopping a deportation, helping someone escape detention, providing
shelter, winning an asylum case, or causing economic damage to companies
profiting from border enforcement.

Actions should build infrastructure of resistance and rebellion,
developing networks, creating alliances, acquiring skills and resources.
The audience for these actions is not the general public but those
fighting alongside the movement. The goal is not to convince the
majority of the population but to strengthen connections between those
directly affected by border violence.

## Arguments and Debates

### Moral Arguments

Advocates for open borders argue that place of birth or nationality
provides no moral justification for differential access to resources,
opportunities, or freedom of movement. The accident of being born in a
particular location does not grant someone greater worth or rights than
someone born elsewhere. Border restrictions essentially create a system
of inherited privilege based purely on birthplace.

The violence of borders - deaths in deserts, drownings at sea, detention
and deportation, family separation - cannot be morally justified by
appeals to national interest or sovereignty. From an anarchist
perspective, the state has no legitimate authority to grant or deny
freedom of movement in the first place.

### Economic Arguments

Proponents argue that open borders would dramatically increase global
wealth, particularly benefiting people from the Global South who could
access higher-paying work. Studies suggest that eliminating migration
restrictions could double global GDP, with the largest gains going to
those currently most impoverished.

Open borders could create pressure for political reforms in countries
with poor conditions or oppressive governments, as the threat of
population exodus would force improvements to retain residents. The
<a href="Estonian_Health_Worker_Strike_(2012)" class="wikilink"
title="Estonian Health Worker Strike (2012)">Estonian Health Worker
Strike (2012)</a> demonstrates how free movement within the EU forced
Estonia to improve conditions when healthcare workers threatened to
leave.

However, some raise concerns that open borders could undermine working
conditions in wealthier countries by expanding the
<a href="Reserve_Army_of_Labour" class="wikilink"
title="reserve army of labor">reserve army of labor</a>. From an
anarchist perspective, this argument mistakes the symptom for the
disease - it is capitalism and state power that pit workers against each
other, not movement itself. The solution lies in international
working-class solidarity, not restricting movement.

### Environmental Concerns

Critics sometimes argue that open borders could accelerate environmental
destruction by allowing more people to adopt resource-intensive
lifestyles. However, this frames the problem incorrectly - it is not
movement or population distribution that drives ecological destruction
but rather capitalist production systems and inequality. Restricting
movement does nothing to address the fundamental causes of environmental
degradation while perpetuating global inequality.

### Cultural Arguments

Some claim that open borders threaten cultural preservation or national
sovereignty. From an anarchist perspective, this concern reveals the
nationalist assumptions underlying border defense. Cultures are not
static entities requiring state protection but living practices that
evolve through human interaction. Cultural diversity flourishes through
contact and exchange, not through state-enforced separation.

Appeals to national sovereignty mistake state authority for collective
self-determination. True autonomy for communities does not require
excluding others but rather creating inclusive social structures based
on voluntary association rather than coerced membership.

## Anarchist Vision

An anarchist world would not simply have "open borders" in the sense of
states that happen to allow free movement - it would have no borders at
all because it would have no states to enforce them. The abolition of
borders follows necessarily from the abolition of state power.

In a society organized through voluntary association and mutual aid
rather than state authority, people would move freely according to their
needs, desires, and relationships. Communities would form and reform
based on affinity, shared projects, and mutual support rather than
arbitrary territorial divisions enforced through violence.

This does not mean the entire world would function as a single
homogeneous unit. Distinct communities with different practices,
languages, and ways of life would continue to exist, but their
boundaries would be fluid and voluntary rather than fixed and coercive.
People would be free to join communities that align with their values
and needs, and free to leave communities that do not serve them.

The infrastructure developed by the No Borders movement today - networks
of solidarity, resources for migrants, practices of mutual aid -
prefigures aspects of this anarchist vision. While operating within and
against existing state structures, these networks demonstrate that
people can organize effective support systems outside state control.

## Practical Organizing

### Building Networks

Effective No Borders work requires creating strong networks to support
free movement. This includes both public organizing - information
sharing, legal support, advocacy - and clandestine infrastructure - safe
houses, document support, evasion of state surveillance. These networks
must address borders within the movement itself, recognizing differences
in legal status, language, education, gender, race, class, and capacity
to face repression.

### Direct Material Support

Rather than focusing on symbolic actions or media campaigns, No Borders
organizing prioritizes direct material outcomes. This means actually
helping people cross borders, evade detention, resist deportation, and
build lives outside state control. It means developing practical skills
and resources - from legal knowledge to safe transportation to secure
communication.

### Strategic Thinking

Effective resistance requires clear thinking about strengths,
weaknesses, and realistic objectives. Tactics should be chosen
strategically based on what can actually be accomplished rather than on
ideological preferences or habit. This includes acknowledging that
serious challenges to border regimes will face serious repression, and
building solidarity structures to support those who face consequences
for their resistance.

### Long-term Vision

No Borders organizing is not merely about helping individuals escape
state control, though this remains vital. It is also about building the
infrastructure for broader resistance and eventually rebellion. The
networks and communities created through migration solidarity work
become the foundation for challenging state power more fundamentally.
