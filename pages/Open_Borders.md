title="History of Borders">History of Borders</a>*

Although open borders arguably existed for most of human history (for
example, migration of forager communities) and borders are an incredibly
new development, with no US-Mexican border existing until the 1870s.

The USA can also be seen as an example of open borders, as the borders
between states within the USA are unrestricted as one can drive from
California to Florida.

The largest and most stable example of open borders from recent history
is the

### Moral Debates

- **For:**Open borders are morally justified given that nationality or
  place of birth does not grant more 'worth' to someones life or the
  right for them to freely travel.

  as workers could travel to countries where they are paid significantly
  more for doing the same work.
- **For:** Open borders would lead to political reforms in poorer and
  more oppressive countries to prevent brain drains, which is what
  happened to

- **Against:** Open borders could lead to greater destruction of the
  environment given that it allows for more people to live middle-class

  sovereignty, which is a bad thing as it decreases trust in a society.
