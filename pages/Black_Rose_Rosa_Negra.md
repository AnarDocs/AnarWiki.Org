(**BRRN**) is a "<a   href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a> political
organization in the
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a> founded in 2013. The organization emerged from a multi-year
unification process of local and regional anarchist groups with a
strategic focus on building popular power through mass movements.[^1]

## History

### Pre-History and Context

In the 1970s-80s, anarchism remained mainly subcultural, though this
period saw reemergence of efforts to form national organized networks
including the Social Revolutionary Anarchist Federation and the
Anarchist Communist Federation of North America. Key work was also done
to rebuild anarchist influence within the labor movement by groups such
as the anarcho-syndicalist
"<a   href="Workers_Solidarity_Alliance.md" class="wikilink"
title="Workers Solidarity Alliance">Workers Solidarity Alliance</a> and
anarchist members within the re-invigorated IWW. During this period, a
number of figures from the
"<a   href="Black_Power_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Power movement">Black Power movement</a>, mainly
incarcerated former members of the
"<a   href="Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a> and
"<a   href="Black_Liberation_Army.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Liberation Army">Black Liberation Army</a>, came to
anarchism through criticisms of the top-down reformism of the
"<a   href="Civil_Rights_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Civil Rights movement">Civil Rights movement</a> and the Leninist
vanguardism of the Black Panthers.[^2]

US anarchism in the 1990s was largely marked by the
"<a   href="Love_and_Rage_Revolutionary_Anarchist_Federation.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Love and Rage Revolutionary Anarchist Federation">Love and Rage
Revolutionary Anarchist Federation</a>, founded in 1991 in Minneapolis.
The group had an activist and street-protest-oriented politics with
strong participation in
"<a   href="anti-war.md" class="wikilink" title="anti-war">anti-war</a>,
abortion rights, and "<a   href="anti-fascist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-fascist">anti-fascist</a> movements. Love and Rage was an
international organization, maintaining a strong local presence in
Mexico City which called itself Amor y Rabia. The group was highly
influenced by the 1994
"<a   href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
rebellion. As Love and Rage grew, it struggled to move beyond its
network mode of organization, with two factions emerging around
questions of structure and strategy. This impasse led Love and Rage to
dissolve in 1998.[^3]

The disbanding of Love and Rage left a legacy that influenced subsequent
groups including Bring the Ruckus, the
"<a   href="Northeastern_Federation_of_Anarchist-Communists.md"
class="wikilink"
title="Northeastern Federation of Anarchist-Communists">Northeastern
Federation of Anarchist-Communists</a> (NEFAC), as well as BRRN. Its
contributions towards anarchist political organization included a
culture of lively internal debate, discussions around the structure of
national organization, expectations and commitment of members, the
nature of US
"<a   href="white_supremacy.md" class="wikilink" title="white supremacy">white
supremacy</a> and need for multi-racial organization, as well as
questions of contemporary revolutionary strategy.[^4]

Coalescing in the wake of the 1999 "Battle of Seattle"
anti-globalization protest, NEFAC was founded in 2000, incorporating
local groups across the northeastern US as well as French speaking
groups in Quebéc and Toronto, Canada. Drawing on the global anarchist
tradition of "<a   href="platformism.md" class="wikilink"
title="platformism">platformism</a>, the group channeled the energies of
anarchists coming out of the "summit hopping" protests of the
anti-globalization era to reorient radicals towards rooted labor and
working-class community organizing. NEFAC was a force for developing
pro-organizational and class-struggle politics within North American
anarchism.[^5]

Another point of influence on the formation of BRRN was the 2007-2008
North American tour by Andrew Flood, a member of the Irish
"<a   href="Workers_Solidarity_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Workers Solidarity Movement">Workers Solidarity Movement</a>.
Founded by former Irish anti-colonial movement activists, WSM was
exceptionally prolific in its campaign activity, publications, and in
promoting platformism internationally as a tendency. The tour
presentation, "Building a Popular Anarchism in Ireland," outlined the
growth of the Irish anarchist movement and made an argument for an
outward looking and organized movement.[^6]

### Founding Process

The process of BRRN's founding emerged from a series of invitational
Class Struggle Anarchist Conferences (CSAC) initiated by the New York
WSA with support from other groups, held in New York City in 2008,
Detroit in 2009, Seattle in 2010, and Buffalo, NY in 2012. By the end of
the Seattle conference a formal network of participating organizations
emerged and agreed to a process of rapprochement whereby delegates from
each group would participate in structured discussions and debates with
the formal goal of building political unity towards founding a national
organization.[^7]

These efforts culminated in a February 2013 conference in Rochester, NY
wherein participants focused on developing a points of unity document
and planning for what would become BRRN's November 2013 founding
convention in Chicago. The formal public announcement of the new
organization was made in January 2014. Core decisions taken at the
convention included commitments towards building a shared strategic
orientation, merging together localized groups and collectives into a
unified national organization, and striving to be a bilingual
English/Spanish organization.[^8]

The groups involved in this process were locals of Common Struggle /
Lucha Común (the new name adopted by NEFAC in 2011) in the northeast,
Rochester Red and Black, Miami Autonomy and Struggle, Four Star
Anarchist Organization in Chicago, Wild Rose Collective in Iowa City,
and individual members of Workers Solidarity Alliance. Groups that
participated in the process but disbanded prior to the founding of BRRN
included Amanecer: For a Popular Anarchism in California, Common Action
in the Pacific Northwest, and Prairie Struggle Organization in the
Canadian prairies. WSA and First of May Anarchist Alliance chose not to
join but continued comradely relations. Soon after the formal
announcement of BRRN's formation, members of the Austin, TX based
collective Desde Abajo began the process of integration.[^9]

### Early Activities and Development

A key influence on the politics of BRRN at its founding was the politics
of "<a   href="especifismo.md" class="wikilink"
title="especifismo">especifismo</a>, the Latin American current of
anarchism that first took shape in 1950s Uruguay and which inspired
anarchists in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. Core concepts drawn from
especifismo included the need to organize on the political,
intermediate, and social levels; the importance of conjunctural analysis
of the contemporary political moment; and the role of
"<a   href="popular_power.md" class="wikilink" title="popular power">popular
power</a> as the lever for revolutionary rupture and
transformation.[^10]

At its founding, BRRN prioritized developing international relations and
highlighting the work of anarchists especially in Latin America,
publishing numerous translated documents and interviews. In 2014, the
organization coordinated the "Struggling to Win: Anarchists Building
Popular Power in Chile" tour which included nearly fifty events in
twenty-two cities across the US. Since then, BRRN has continued
prioritizing internationalism through numerous solidarity campaigns,
delegations to international gatherings, and ongoing relationships with
anarchist political organizations around the globe. In 2023, BRRN became
a formal member of the International Anarchist Coordination, a network
of over a dozen platformist and especifista groups across the
globe.[^11]

Another early focus was building a robust external media infrastructure
aimed at presenting a diverse and movement-focused public face for
anarchism. This has included strong social media presence, the creation
of the From Below Podcast, and in 2016 the publication of the online
booklet *Black Anarchism: A Reader*. The organization has published a
series of articles on
"<a   href="Black_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Black Anarchism">Black
Anarchism</a>, debates on electoralism, anarchism in Latin America, and
"<a   href="feminist_theory.md" class="wikilink"
title="feminist theory">feminist theory</a>.[^12]

### The Trump Era and Restructuring

With the election of Trump in 2016, BRRN focused on better understanding
the developing conjuncture. The organization released a series of
strategy documents in this period, including 2017's "Below and Beyond
Trump", a 2018 follow-up piece "Building Popular Power in a Time of
Reaction" and the statement "Kavanaugh and a Feminist Movement Fighting
to End Capitalism". The pieces discussed the growing political crisis of
the US ruling class and subsequent social and political polarization,
the rise of the
"<a   href="far-right.md" class="wikilink" title="far-right">far-right</a> and
growth of left and socialist politics, and the need to rebuild offensive
movements from below guided by a clear libertarian socialist
program.[^13]

In May 2017, a member published an op-ed in *The Oregonian* responding
to police repression of the Portland International Workers Day march and
was featured in a Vice News segment on left-wing
"<a   href="antifa.md" class="wikilink" title="antifa">antifa</a> protests in
Portland.[^14][^15]

In the wake of the pandemic and George Floyd Rebellion in 2020, BRRN
experienced a period of internal conflict that resulted in a substantial
number of members exiting the organization. BRRN members resolved to
take a two-year hiatus from public activity in order to reflect,
restructure, and reorient the organization. Coming out of this period,
the organization held a year-long process of collective debate and
analysis to develop a more concise and deliberate national strategy.
This process produced the organization's first ever political program,
"Turning the Tide: An Anarchist Program for Popular Power" released on
May Day 2023.[^16]

## Organisation

BRRN is structured as a bilingual English/Spanish organization with a
national federation structure composed of local groups across the United
States. The organization is committed to building political unity
through structured discussion and debate among member groups.[^17]

## Strategy and Activities

BRRN's strategic orientation centers on building
"<a   href="popular_power.md" class="wikilink" title="popular power">popular
power</a> through mass movements. The organization defines popular power
as the long-term process of building independent, durable, and combative
social movements that can not only wrest reforms from the dominant
classes in the present, but function to accumulate the necessary
capacity and force to carry out a revolutionary social transformation.
This approach emphasizes rooted movement building and sustained bases of
working-class power where members live, work, and study, in contrast to
recurring cycles of single-issue, activist-oriented mobilization.[^18]

### Labor and Workplace Organizing

Most prominent has been BRRN's focus on labor and workplace struggles.
Members have played key roles in starting new unions in healthcare and
higher education, participated in major strikes in K-12 and higher
education, helped formed rank-and-file caucuses in the building trades,
organized healthcare worker demands during COVID, organized Palestine
and BLM solidarity campaigns in workplaces, built an organized presence
at Labor Notes conferences, and released a 2019 analysis on the state of
unions and worker struggles.[^19]

### Other Movement Work

In the realm of social movements, BRRN has worked to rebuild the
tradition of mass anarchism rooted in contemporary popular and
working-class struggles. This includes rank and file labor organizing
among teachers and building new unions with fast food workers,
solidarity networks, popular assemblies, and tenant struggles with
Autonomous Tenant Union Network, feminist organizing and struggles
around bodily autonomy, fighting fascists, organizing students on
campuses, and struggling against the violence of the carceral state. The
organization has participated in large moments of street protest and
rebellion including the Ferguson Uprising and NYC People's Climate March
in 2014, Standing Rock in 2016, revolutionary feminist interventions in
the Women's March and anti-fascist organizing before, during and after
the Charlottesville events in 2017, and the George Floyd Rebellion of
2020.[^20]
