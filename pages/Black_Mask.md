An anarchist "street gang with an analysis," Black Mask was formed by
Ben Morea and Ron Hahne in New York City in 1966. Later called Up
Against the Wall, Motherfuckers, the group's militant and theatrical
actions included the pioneering use of the black bloc, fighting their
way into the Pentagon, and cutting the fence at
"<a   href="Woodstock_Festival.md" class="wikilink"
title="Woodstock Festival">Woodstock Festival</a>. The group's member
Osha Newmann described their asthetic as "flower power with thorns."[^1]

Black Mask's many influences included the New York jazz scene, the
beatniks, Dada, Surrealism, Situationism, Frantz Fanon, black
nationalism, Anarchism and radical feminism. While somewhat
disillusioned with the city's formal Anarchist groups, Morea knew and
liked the Libertarian League and the local Anarchist Murray Bookchin.
Black Mask also befriended the radical feminist Valerie Solanas who
wrote *SCUM Manifesto* and later tried to assassinate the painter Andy
Warhol. The Situationist International briefly invited Black Mask to
affiliate but revoked the offer after deciding that Black Mask member
Allan Hoffman was too mystical. Black Mask became a non-student chapter
of Students for a Democratic Society.[^2]

One of Black Mask's first actions entailed shutting down the Museum of
Modern Art. Morea explains:

> We felt that art itself, the creative effort, was an obviously
> worthwhile, valuable and even spiritual experience. The Museum and
> gallery system separated art from that living interchange and had
> nothing to do with the vital, creative urge. Museums weren't a living
> house, they were just a repository. We were searching for ways to
> raise questions about how things were presented and closing down MOMA
> was just one of them.
>
> The action was a success. We'd announced our plans in advance and they
> closed the museum in fear of what we might do. A lot of people stopped
> and talked with us about what we were doing and this action and others
> attracted radical artists to our fold.[^3]

In 1967, Black Mask wore black clothing and masks and walked through
Wall Street with a sign declaring "Wall St. is War St." The historian
Andrew Cornell notes that this action apparently marked the first use of
what became known as the "black bloc" tactic. At an antiwar
demonstration in October of the same year, Black Mask members briefly
fought their way into a less-guarded door of the Pentagon.[^4]

In 1968, the group changed their name to Up Against the Wall,
Motherfuckers (UAW/MF).[^5] Abbie Hoffman described UAW/MF as "the
middle-class nightmare … an anti-media media phenomenon simply because
their name could not be printed."[^6]

In 1969, UAW/MF cut the fences at the
"<a   href="Woodstock_Festival.md" class="wikilink"
title="Woodstock Festival">Woodstock Festival</a>, letting people in for
free.[^7]

Many UAW/MF members left New York in 1971 to escape what Cornell
describes as an "escalating cycle of violent protest, drug use, and
incarceration they found themselves becoming trapped in."[^8] Cornell
notes that UAW/MF was "an overwhelmingly male group whose members
evinced a swaggering macho posture."[^9]
