<a href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
whose bombing campaign against magistrates in 1892 made him both a
martyr figure within anarchist circles and a symbol of the
contradictions inherent in violent
<a href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>. While his
actions were motivated by genuine outrage at state repression and
judicial persecution of anarchists, they ultimately contributed to
intensified crackdowns on the anarchist movement and alienated potential
sympathizers.

Born into grinding poverty in Saint-Chamond, Ravachol experienced
firsthand the brutality of capitalist exploitation and state violence.
His bombing campaign targeted Judge Edmond Benoît and Prosecutor Léon
Bulot, who had handed down harsh sentences to anarchists arrested during
the
<a href="Clichy_affair.md" class="wikilink" title="Clichy affair">Clichy
affair</a> of 1891. Though his attacks caused no deaths, Ravachol's
arrest, trials, and execution by guillotine transformed him into a folk
hero and launched the <a href="Ère_des_attentats.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ère des attentats">Ère des attentats</a> (1892–1894), a period of
anarchist bombings in France that proved both inspiring and devastating
to the movement.

## Early Life

François Claudius Ravachol was born on 14 October 1859 in Saint-Chamond,
Loire, the eldest of four children. His father, Jean Adam Koenigstein,
was Dutch, and his mother, Marie Ravachol, was French. His childhood was
marked by severe poverty and domestic violence—his father beat his
mother before eventually abandoning the family entirely.[^1]

Left to support the family alone, Marie worked intermittently as a
laborer in the raw silk industry when she could find employment. She
frequently sent young François to beg for money, and he began working at
an early age despite attending school. The material deprivation was
crushing—he left school at age eleven after being bullied by classmates
for wearing shabby clothes.

Around this time, Ravachol worked as a livestock herder during winter
without proper shoes, his feet constantly frozen. His younger sister
died of fever during this period. In the years that followed, he worked
as a shepherd, miner, and in various other industries in the region,
experiencing the full spectrum of working-class exploitation. He was
once fired from a job for arriving five minutes late, despite having
worked many unpaid overtime hours—a crystallizing moment that revealed
the arbitrary cruelty of capitalist labor relations.[^2]

At age sixteen, he secured an apprenticeship as a dyer in Saint-Chamond,
but the arrangement ended without the dyers offering him permanent
employment or advanced training. For additional income, he played
accordion at society balls on Sundays in Saint-Étienne, earning five
francs per evening.[^3]

## Radicalization

### Exposure to Anarchist Ideas

When his apprenticeship ended unsuccessfully, Ravachol left the
Saint-Étienne region for Lyon in search of work. There, he began
attending public readings in study circles that discussed socialist and
anarchist newspapers. At eighteen, he read Eugène Sue's novel *The
Wandering Jew* (1844), which, according to his own testimony, initiated
his break from religious belief.[^4]

His complete rejection of religion came after attending a lecture by
communard Paule Minck on 3 December 1881 in Saint-Chamond. Minck
discussed the *Semaine sanglante* (Bloody Week) of the Paris Commune,
and her account of state violence against working people profoundly
affected the young worker.

### Descent into Illegalism

After being dismissed from another job along with his brother, Ravachol
found himself unemployed and unable to provide for his family. He began
stealing chickens while his brother stole coal. Simultaneously, he was
gradually adopting anarchist ideas and attempting to make bombs, though
initially without success. His possession of dangerous materials became
known when he was arrested after supplying sulfuric acid to a woman.[^5]

During this period, Ravachol's relationship with his mother deteriorated
after she reproached him for having an intimate relationship with a
married woman. He severed ties with her entirely. His actions became
increasingly desperate and morally troubling: on the night of 14-15 May
1891, he dug up the grave of Baroness de la Rochetaillée in Terrenoire,
attempting to steal her jewelry, though he found nothing.[^6]

Ravachol also began selling alcohol illegally and became involved in
counterfeiting operations. Most damningly, on 18 June 1891 in Chambles,
he murdered and robbed Jacques Brunel, a 93-year-old hermit who had
lived off alms while secretly accumulating donations over fifty
years.[^7]

The police arrested Ravachol for the murder, but he managed a dramatic
escape. As officers seized him outside his residence, he struggled,
insulted them, and declared that the anarchists' revenge would fall upon
them. During his transfer, an accomplice carrying a package blocked the
officers' path. While police questioned this person, Ravachol shoved two
officers with his shoulder and fled at high speed toward Terrenoire,
disappearing into the night.[^8]

### The Context of State Repression

It is crucial to understand that Ravachol's radicalization occurred
against a backdrop of extraordinary state violence against working
people and anarchists. In 1891, the
<a href="Fourmies_massacre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fourmies massacre">Fourmies massacre</a> saw the army open fire
on demonstrators demanding an eight-hour workday, killing multiple
workers. The
<a href="Clichy_affair.md" class="wikilink" title="Clichy affair">Clichy
affair</a> that same year involved anarchists being arrested, struck
with sabers, beaten, and deprived of water and medical care by police.

When the arrested anarchists were tried, prosecutor Léon Bulot demanded
the death penalty for all three, and judge Edmond Benoît sentenced them
to harsh prison terms of two and five years. This judicial persecution
had a profound impact on anarchist circles throughout France. For
Ravachol, who had experienced a lifetime of exploitation, poverty, and
violence at the hands of the capitalist system, the Clichy affair
represented an intolerable escalation of state repression.[^9]

## The Bombing Campaign

### Formation of "Ravachol's Band"

After his escape, Ravachol hid with two companions, Rosalie Soubère and
Joseph Jas-Béala. He eventually traveled to Paris using a false name,
where Charles Chaumentin and his wife, both anarchist militants,
welcomed and hosted him. Soubère and Jas-Béala joined him there, and the
group met Charles Simon, a young anarchist militant whom Chaumentin
introduced as someone who "knew Paris like the back of his hand."[^10]

Deeply shocked by the judicial persecution of the Clichy anarchists,
Ravachol decided to take direct action against the magistrates
responsible. On the night of 14-15 February 1892, the group stole thirty
kilograms of dynamite from the Soisy-sur-Seine quarry, providing them
with the material for their planned attacks.[^11]

### The Saint-Germain Bombing

On 11 March 1892, the group executed their first attack targeting Judge
Benoît's residence at 136 Boulevard Saint-Germain. Ravachol and Simon
built the bomb, and Simon conducted reconnaissance. The four
conspirators took the tramway to the location, with Soubère carrying the
bomb hidden under her skirts as she sat between Simon and Jas-Béala.

She handed the bomb to Ravachol, who entered the building armed with two
loaded pistols. Not knowing Benoît's exact location, he placed the bomb
on the second floor and lit the fuse. While Soubère and Jas-Béala stood
watch outside, Ravachol remained to observe the explosion's aftermath as
his companions departed.[^12]

The bombing caused no deaths and did not harm Judge Benoît, who lived on
the fifth floor. One person was injured. The attack's failure did not
satisfy the group—they decided to make another attempt, this time
targeting prosecutor Bulot.

### The Clichy Bombing and Arrests

Preparation for the second attack was complicated by the arrest of
Charles Simon after Charles Chaumentin betrayed the group to police,
having become a police informant. According to historian Jean Maitron,
this denunciation provided little useful information to authorities, who
already knew most of what Chaumentin revealed.[^13]

Nevertheless, Ravachol proceeded with the Clichy bombing using similar
tactics, this time injuring seven people while still failing to kill or
seriously harm prosecutor Bulot.[^14]

## Arrest, Trials, and Execution

### Denunciation

On 30 March 1892, Ravachol was dining at the restaurant *Le Véry* on
Boulevard Magenta when an employee, Jules Lhérot, recognized him and
informed the owner, Jean-Marie Véry. Véry denounced Ravachol to police,
leading to his arrest. Though police increased security around the
restaurant, anarchist militants Jean-Pierre François and Théodule
Meunier soon carried out the
<a href="Véry_bombing.md" class="wikilink" title="Véry bombing">Véry
bombing</a>, killing Véry in revenge for his collaboration with
authorities.[^15]

### The First Trial

Ravachol's trial opened on 26 April 1892 at the Seine Assizes Court.
This was an extraordinary trial for several reasons. It was divided into
two parts: the Paris bombings were tried in Seine, while his earlier
crimes would be tried later in Montbrison. It was also the first trial
of such magnitude for an anarchist terrorist, representing a moment of
crisis for the French Third Republic.[^16]

Authorities faced a fundamental dilemma: they needed to conduct what
appeared to be a fair trial—allowing Ravachol to speak freely to
legitimize their judicial system—while preventing the trial from
becoming a political platform for anarchism. The royalist press mocked
this contradiction, pointing out that republicans who had once advocated
revolution were now being outflanked on their left.[^17]

Authorities attempted to control the jury's composition and carefully
select the attending public. Later during the Ère des attentats, laws
would restrict press freedom during anarchist trials. Ravachol was
defended by lawyer Lagasse, who had previously defended one of those
arrested in the Clichy affair. Parisian anarchist circles helped gather
information about jurors to challenge those likely to convict.

Ravachol's defensive strategy, developed with Lagasse, was to highlight
the trial's political dimension and defend the reasoning behind the
attacks. Unable to read well, Ravachol began with a written statement
that he read with difficulty:

> I struck the president Mr. Benoît: 1° Because he showed himself to be
> too biased during the Decamps trial and because he increased the
> sentence to the maximum; 2° Because he paid no attention to the
> violence committed by the police against Decamps and Dardare, who were
> left for dead. My vengeance targeted Mr. Bulot because he had demanded
> the death penalty against an honest father. I wanted to make those
> responsible for enforcing punishments understand that they should be
> more lenient. As for the innocent victims I may have harmed, I
> sincerely regret it. I regret it all the more because my life has been
> full of bitterness. I deeply regret also bringing to these benches
> people whose only fault was knowing me. Anarchy aims to make society
> one big family where the weakest will be protected by all, where
> everyone will have enough to eat.

An anonymous juror quoted in *Le Figaro* captured how Ravachol exposed
the ritual of political trials: "It is the trial of a party that he is
bringing before us; it is anarchy alone that he asks us to condemn in
his defence, and in doing so, he transforms us, without our realizing
it, into politicians sitting in a sort of political tribunal."[^18]

Ultimately, Ravachol was found guilty along with Simon, but with
mitigating circumstances that spared them the death penalty. They were
sentenced to life in penal labor. Soubère, Jas-Béala, and Chaumentin
were acquitted.

### The Second Trial and Execution

Ravachol's second trial occurred on 21 June 1892 before the Loire Assize
Court in Montbrison for his pre-bombing crimes. He admitted to the grave
robbing and murdering the hermit of Chambles but denied other charges.
His brother and sister testified to his role as a father figure during
their childhood. He was convicted and sentenced to death for crimes he
committed and probably others he did not.[^19]

After his condemnation, he declared: "May my innocent and involuntary
victims understand and forgive me. \[...\] Long live anarchy!"

He was refused the right to read a final statement, which he instead
gave to his lawyer. The statement was likely written by Ravachol with
help from his lawyer and other anarchists.[^20] Authorities sought to
execute him as quickly as possible and were pleased when he refused to
appeal.

On 11 July 1892, Ravachol was guillotined at Montbrison. He refused to
see a chaplain, declaring: "Courage, it's easy to say, but you can't
always be sure you'll have it in moments like this; I'll have some, if I
can.—Look, they're giving me my finest clothes; I'll be stylish, it's
like I'm going to a ball.—The chaplain? I don't want him. Consolations
at a time like this are nonsense! Religion, I don't give a damn about
it. It's only good for idiots, and all people are idiots."[^21]

During transport to the guillotine, he repeatedly sang the sixth stanza
of *La Chanson du Père Dûchene.* As he was positioned next to the
guillotine, he stepped toward the crowd to speak but was interrupted by
executioners. His last words, as his head was about to be severed, were:
"Pigs, long live the Republi...!"[^22]

## Legacy and Critical Assessment

### The Martyrdom of Ravachol

Ravachol was the first anarchist guillotined in France, as noted by
Émile Pouget. Within anarchist circles, initial reactions were mixed.
Many anarchists were disturbed that Ravachol had committed morally
troubling crimes—grave desecration and the murder of an elderly
hermit—before engaging in political violence. Some initially distanced
themselves from his actions.[^23]

However, his conduct during the trials transformed this perception. By
taking full responsibility for the bombings and attempting to protect
his companions, and through his dignified behavior before execution,
Ravachol was gradually rehabilitated as a hero and martyr within
anarchist circles. As historian Hélène Millot describes: "The anarchist
press did not immediately rally behind Ravachol, who seemed to many to
be disreputable, or even suspicious. \[...\] Within a few days, Ravachol
gained political legitimacy and became the hero of Anarchy—or rather its
herald: he had indeed used his trial as a platform for propaganda,
turning it into a political forum."[^24]

Some anarchist intellectuals even drew Christ-like parallels: Ravachol
sought to convert those he encountered to anarchism, died at age 33, and
went to his "martyrdom" singing an anticlerical song. Writer Paul Adam
asked: "To have affirmed the right to existence at the risk of being
vilified by the herd of civic slaves and of incurring the ignominy of
the scaffold, to have conceived as a technique the elimination of the
useless in order to support an idea of liberation, to have had the
audacity to conceive it and the devotion to carry it out, is this not
sufficient to deserve the title of Redeemer?"[^25]

Within France more broadly, Ravachol became a folk hero. From his second
attack onward, the press portrayed him as an unknown champion of the
people. Poems and songs were published in his honor, such as *La
Complainte de Ravachol* and *La Ravachole*. An anarchist group in
Belleville, Paris in the late 1890s named themselves "The Avengers of
Ravachol."

### The Counterproductive Nature of Propaganda by the Deed

While Ravachol's intentions were rooted in legitimate rage against state
violence and judicial persecution, his bombing campaign ultimately
proved counterproductive in several critical ways:

**Intensified State Repression:** The bombings provided authorities with
justification for harsh crackdowns on anarchist organizing. Laws
restricting press freedom during anarchist trials were enacted.
Surveillance and persecution of anarchists intensified dramatically.

**Loss of Public Sympathy:** Though some working-class Parisians
celebrated Ravachol as an outlaw hero, the broader public reaction
included fear and revulsion. The bombings, even though they caused no
deaths in the initial attacks, injured innocent people and alienated
potential sympathizers who might otherwise have been receptive to
anarchist critiques of capitalism and state power.

**The Cycle of Escalation:** Ravachol's actions launched the Ère des
attentats (1892-1894), inspiring other anarchists like Théodule Meunier,
Auguste Vaillant, and Émile Henry to carry out further attacks. This
cycle of violence and counter-violence strengthened reactionary forces
and undermined constructive anarchist organizing.

**Strategic Failure:** The bombings failed to achieve their immediate
objectives—neither Judge Benoît nor Prosecutor Bulot were killed or
seriously harmed. The attacks did not deter state repression; instead,
they invited more severe responses.

**Moral Compromises:** Ravachol's earlier criminal activities, including
the murder of an elderly hermit, complicated his political legacy. While
his poverty-driven crimes can be understood within the context of
capitalist immiseration, they made it easier for authorities to paint
all anarchists as common criminals rather than political
revolutionaries.

### A More Nuanced Understanding

Ravachol's story illuminates fundamental tensions within anarchist
thought about violence, strategy, and revolutionary change. His genuine
suffering under capitalism, his outrage at state brutality, and his
willingness to sacrifice himself were authentic expressions of
revolutionary spirit. Yet his methods—targeting symbols of state power
through indiscriminate bombings that harmed innocent people—failed to
advance anarchist goals and arguably set the movement back.

The challenge for anarchists has always been to resist illegitimate
domination and violence without replicating the authoritarian structures
and tactics of oppressors. Ravachol's life raises difficult questions:
When is violent resistance justified? What distinguishes revolutionary
violence from terrorism? How can oppressed people respond to state
violence without becoming isolated from potential allies?

Contemporary anarchists can honor Ravachol's memory by learning from
both his courage and his mistakes. His life testifies to the brutal
realities of capitalist exploitation and state repression. His failure
demonstrates that propaganda by the deed, particularly when it harms
innocent people, tends to strengthen rather than weaken systems of
domination.

The most enduring anarchist resistance has typically emerged not from
isolated acts of spectacular violence but from patient organizing,
mutual aid, direct action that minimizes harm, and the construction of
alternative institutions that prefigure the free society anarchists seek
to create.

## Cultural Influence

Ravachol's figure profoundly influenced French literature and art. His
biography—marked by an unhappy childhood, betrayals, impossible loves,
and dramatic confrontations with authority—made him a favored character
in fin-de-siècle literature. The police hunt for him foreshadowed
adventure novels and partly inspired the character Fantômas.[^26]

Many French writers and artists were deeply affected by the Ère des
attentats he launched, including Jean Ajalbert, Francis Vielé-Griffin,
Maurice Beaubourg, Paul Claudel, Bernard Lazare, Camille Mauclair,
Stuart Merrill, Lucien Muhlfeld, Adolphe Retté, Saint-Pol-Roux, Octave
Mirbeau, and Stéphane Mallarmé.[^27]

Strasbourg-based Situationist students active in May 1968 associated
their manifesto *On the Poverty of Student Life* with a "Society for the
Rehabilitation of Karl Marx and Ravachol." More recently, two cities in
the video game *Disco Elysium*—Revachol (the game's setting) and
Koenigstein—are named after him.
