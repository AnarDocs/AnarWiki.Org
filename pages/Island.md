# Island

## Overview

***Island*** is a 1962
<a href="utopian_fiction.md" class="wikilink" title="utopian">utopian</a>
manifesto and novel by English writer
<a href="Aldous_Huxley.md" class="wikilink" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous
Huxley</a>, representing the author's final work before his death in
1963. The novel serves as Huxley's utopian counterpart to his most
famous work, the 1932 <a href="dystopian_novel.md" class="wikilink"
title="dystopian novel">dystopian novel</a>
*<a href="Brave_New_World.md" class="wikilink" title="Brave New World">Brave
New World</a>*. Though it contains a conventional plot, the narrative
primarily functions as a vehicle for exploring philosophical concepts
rather than developing traditional narrative tension.[^1]

The work represents the culmination of Huxley's dramatic political
transformation from an elitist authoritarian in the 1920s and early
1930s to a committed
<a href="pacifist.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifist">pacifist</a> and
<a href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a> by 1937. Born
into Britain's "intellectual aristocracy" in 1894, Huxley experienced
profound personal traumas - his mother's early death, near-blindness,
and his brother's suicide - that initially led him toward cynical
nihilism and advocacy for rule by intellectual elites. However, his
conversion to
<a href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a> in
1935, influenced by figures like Gerald Heard and the
<a href="anarcho-pacifist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-pacifist">anarcho-pacifist</a> Bart de Ligt,
fundamentally altered his worldview.

The work depicts the fictional island of
<a href="Pala.md" class="wikilink" title="Pala">Pala</a>, where inhabitants
have created a nearly perfect society by blending Western science with
Eastern <a href="Mahayana_Buddhism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mahayana Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a>, incorporating practices
such as <a href="psychedelic_drug.md" class="wikilink"
title="psychedelic">psychedelic</a> enlightenment,
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and <a href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a>.
*Island* represents "the first fully realized libertarian utopia since
Morris's *<a href="News_from_Nowhere.md" class="wikilink"
title="News from Nowhere">News from Nowhere</a>*" and embodies Huxley's
mature vision of what he called "philosophical anarchism."

## Summary

The story follows Will Farnaby, a cynical journalist and corporate
lackey who deliberately shipwrecks himself on the shores of Pala, an
island located between
<a href="Sumatra.md" class="wikilink" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and the
<a href="Andaman_Islands.md" class="wikilink"
title="Andaman Islands">Andaman Islands</a>. Farnaby has been tasked by
oil baron Lord Joseph "Joe" Aldehyde with persuading the island's queen
to sell drilling rights to Pala's untapped oil reserves.

Upon arrival, Farnaby discovers a society that has achieved remarkable
harmony through the integration of Western scientific knowledge and
Eastern spiritual practices. The Palanese have developed a culture
centered on mindfulness, community child-rearing through Mutual Adoption
Clubs (MACs), and the ceremonial use of
"<a href="moksha.md" class="wikilink" title="moksha">moksha</a>-medicine" -
a <a href="psychedelic_drug.md" class="wikilink"
title="psychedelic drug">psychedelic drug</a> used for spiritual insight
and personal growth.

The island faces imminent destruction from both external military
threats (Colonel Dipa's forces from neighbouring Rendang-Lobo) and
internal corruption (the westernised Queen Rani and her materialistic
son Murugan). Despite Farnaby's initial complicity in the island's
exploitation, he ultimately experiences spiritual transformation through
the Palanese way of life, particularly through his relationship with
Susila MacPhail and his eventual use of the moksha-medicine.

The novel concludes tragically with the invasion of Pala by Colonel
Dipa's forces, supported by Murugan's betrayal of his own people. The
utopian experiment ends with military occupation and the execution of
key figures like Dr. Robert MacPhail.

## Anarchist and Libertarian Socialist Themes

*Island* presents a compelling vision of
<a href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a> in practice,
embodying many principles that would later be associated with
<a href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
thought and <a href="anti-authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> movements.

### Huxley's Political Evolution

Huxley's journey to the anarchist principles embodied in *Island* was
neither direct nor obvious. During the 1920s and early 1930s, he
advocated for authoritarian rule by intellectual elites, influenced by
figures like H.L. Mencken and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto. In his 1927
work *Proper Studies*, he argued for "the creation and maintenance of a
ruling aristocracy of mind" and supported
<a href="eugenics.md" class="wikilink" title="eugenics">eugenics</a>
programs including compulsory sterilisation.

His dramatic conversion began in 1935 following a personal crisis
involving severe insomnia and depression. Three key figures facilitated
his transformation: Gerald Heard (who introduced him to
<a href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a>), F.M.
Alexander (who taught him physical re-education), and Dr. J.E.R.
McDonagh (who treated his chronic health issues). This period marked his
embrace of
<a href="pacifism.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifism">pacifism</a> and
subsequent involvement with the
<a href="Peace_Pledge_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>.

Crucially, Huxley was deeply influenced by
<a href="anarcho-pacifist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-pacifist">anarcho-pacifist</a> theorist Bart de Ligt,
whose maxim "the more violence, the less revolution" aligned with
Huxley's belief that ends cannot justify means. He also studied the work
of Richard B. Gregg, whose concept of "moral jiu-jitsu" provided a
framework for <a href="non-violent_resistance.md" class="wikilink"
title="non-violent resistance">non-violent resistance</a>. By 1937,
Huxley was openly expressing sympathy for the
<a href="anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
in the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, declaring that
"Anarchism seems to me much more likely to lead to desirable social
change than highly centralized, dictatorial Communism."

Huxley explicitly describes Pala's economic system as "decentralist and
<a href="Georgism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry-Georgian">Henry-Georgian</a>", rejecting both
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
exploitation and
<a href="state_socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>
control. The Palanese practice selective industrialisation, using
technology only when it serves human needs rather than profit
maximisation. They embrace
<a href="appropriate_technology.md" class="wikilink"
title="appropriate technology">appropriate technology</a>, utilising
<a href="hydroelectricity.md" class="wikilink"
title="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> for essential services
like food preservation while avoiding the alienating overdevelopment
characteristic of industrial
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

### Cooperative Politics

The political structure of Pala is described as
"<a href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kropotkinesque">Kropotkinesque</a> and co-operative", directly
referencing the <a href="anarcho-communist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-communist">anarcho-communist</a> philosopher
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>. The island operates without a traditional military or
coercive state apparatus, instead relying on voluntary cooperation and
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>.
Decision-making appears to be collective and consensus-based, though the
novel doesn't elaborate extensively on formal political structures.

### Anti-Authoritarian Education

The Palanese educational system merges sciences, arts, and self-control
techniques with spiritual development, rejecting the hierarchical,
competition-based models typical of
<a href="capitalist.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
societies. Education focuses on personal growth, critical thinking, and
community integration rather than producing obedient workers or
consumers.

### Critique of <a href="State.md" class="wikilink" title="State">State</a> Violence

The novel's tragic ending serves as a powerful indictment of
<a href="militarism.md" class="wikilink" title="militarism">militarism</a>
and <a href="imperialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="imperialism">imperialism</a>. The destruction of Pala by
neighbouring military forces represents the vulnerability of peaceful,
<a href="anti-authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> societies to violent,
hierarchical powers. This reflects anarchist concerns about the inherent
aggression of <a href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>
systems and their tendency to destroy alternative social arrangements.

### Alternative Technology and Self-Sufficiency

Drawing from his extensive research into
<a href="decentralisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralisation">decentralisation</a>, Huxley envisioned Pala as
demonstrating the practical viability of
<a href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a>. His
correspondence with economists and inventors informed the novel's
technological aspects: "Take a township of a thousand inhabitants; give
it three or four thousand acres of land and a good system of producers'
and consumers' co-operatives: it could feed itself completely; it could
supply about two-thirds of its other needs on the spot."

This vision represented what Huxley called "a restatement of the
Emersonian doctrine of self-reliance" - communities achieving
independence through <a href="cooperative.md" class="wikilink"
title="cooperative">cooperative</a> organisation and
<a href="appropriate_technology.md" class="wikilink"
title="appropriate technology">appropriate technology</a>. He advocated
for "agricultural techniques designed to supply the basic social unit,
the family, with its staple food supply; mechanical techniques for the
production of many consumer goods for a local market; financial
techniques, such as those of the credit union."

The Mutual Adoption Clubs (MACs) represent a form of extended
<a href="community.md" class="wikilink" title="community">community</a>
child-rearing that breaks down traditional nuclear family structures and
private property relations regarding children. This communalistic
approach aligns with anarchist critiques of the patriarchal family as a
foundation of authoritarian social relations.

## Psychedelic Liberation

Huxley's incorporation of "moksha-medicine" anticipates later
connections between <a href="psychedelic.md" class="wikilink"
title="psychedelic">psychedelic</a> experiences and
<a href="anti-authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> consciousness. The
ceremonial use of
<a href="entheogen.md" class="wikilink" title="entheogens">entheogens</a>
in Pala serves multiple functions that align with anarchist values:

- **Breaking down ego boundaries** that support hierarchical thinking
- **Fostering empathy and interconnectedness** essential for cooperative
  society
- **Challenging conventional reality** and opening minds to alternative
  possibilities
- **Providing direct spiritual experience** independent of religious
  authorities

The moksha mushroom, likely based on
*<a href="Psilocybe.md" class="wikilink" title="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>*
species, represents a tool for consciousness expansion that cannot be
controlled by <a href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>
or corporate powers.

## Critiques

From an anarchist perspective, *Island* contains several limitations:

### Geographic Isolation

The island setting, while literarily convenient, raises questions about
the scalability and defensibility of such experiments. Real-world
anarchist projects must contend with existing
<a href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> systems and
cannot rely on geographic isolation.

### Lack of Revolutionary Strategy

The novel offers little guidance on how to achieve such a society within
existing
<a href="capitalist.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
and
<a href="state_socialist.md" class="wikilink" title="state socialist">state
socialist</a> contexts. The Palanese system appears to have developed
through fortunate historical circumstances rather than conscious
revolutionary struggle.

### Technological Dependence

While advocating for selective technology use, the society still depends
on certain industrial processes and global trade networks, potentially
making it vulnerable to external economic pressures.

## Historical Context and Influence

Written during the
<a href="Cold_War.md" class="wikilink" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>
period, *Island* offered a "third way" between
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
and
<a href="state_communist.md" class="wikilink" title="state communist">state
communist</a> models. Huxley's vision anticipated many themes that would
become central to the <a href="counterculture.md" class="wikilink"
title="counterculture">counterculture</a> movements of the 1960s,
including:

- <a href="Psychedelic.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Psychedelic">Psychedelic</a> consciousness expansion
- <a href="Ecological.md" class="wikilink" title="Ecological">Ecological</a>
  awareness and <a href="appropriate_technology.md" class="wikilink"
  title="appropriate technology">appropriate technology</a>
- <a href="Eastern_philosophy.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Eastern philosophy">Eastern philosophy</a> and
  <a href="meditation.md" class="wikilink" title="meditation">meditation</a>
  practices
- <a href="Communal_living.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Communal living">Communal living</a> experiments
- <a href="Anti-war.md" class="wikilink" title="Anti-war">Anti-war</a> and
  <a href="pacifist.md" class="wikilink" title="pacifist">pacifist</a>
  activism

Huxley's transformation from elitist authoritarian to
<a href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a> reflected
broader intellectual currents of his time. His work with the
<a href="Peace_Pledge_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>, involvement with
figures like
<a href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> (who sought his support for the
<a href="SIA.md" class="wikilink" title="SIA">SIA</a> - Solidaridad
Internacional Antifascista), and correspondence with
<a href="anarcho-pacifist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-pacifist">anarcho-pacifist</a> theorists positioned him
as a bridge between traditional
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> and
what would later emerge as "new anarchism" focused on
<a href="ecology.md" class="wikilink" title="ecology">ecology</a>,
<a href="alternative_technology.md" class="wikilink"
title="alternative technology">alternative technology</a>, and
<a href="decentralisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralisation">decentralisation</a>.

The novel influenced various
<a href="utopian_community.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian communities">utopian communities</a> and
<a href="intentional_communities.md" class="wikilink"
title="intentional communities">intentional communities</a> throughout
the 1960s and beyond, though none achieved the comprehensive integration
depicted in Pala. As Theodore Roszak noted by the end of the 1960s,
*Island* was "cluttered with brilliant communitarian ideas and insights"
and "had great influence among its young readers."

## Legacy

*Island* remains relevant to contemporary anarchist and
<a href="libertarian_socialist.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialist">libertarian socialist</a> movements as:

- A detailed vision of how <a href="anti-authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
  title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> principles might
  function in practice
- An exploration of
  <a href="technology.md" class="wikilink" title="technology">technology</a>'s
  role in liberated society
- A warning about the vulnerability of peaceful alternatives to
  <a href="state_violence.md" class="wikilink" title="state violence">state
  violence</a>
- An integration of <a href="spirituality.md" class="wikilink"
  title="spirituality">spirituality</a> and
  <a href="politics.md" class="wikilink" title="politics">politics</a> that
  transcends traditional
  <a href="left-right.md" class="wikilink" title="left-right">left-right</a>
  divisions

The novel's tragic conclusion serves as both inspiration and warning:
while alternative societies are possible, they require active defence
against the forces of
<a href="domination.md" class="wikilink" title="domination">domination</a>
and <a href="exploitation.md" class="wikilink"
title="exploitation">exploitation</a>.
