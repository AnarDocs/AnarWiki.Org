# Voluntaryism

## Overview

**Voluntaryism** is a <a href="Propertarianism" class="wikilink"
title="Propertarian">Propertarian</a> political philosophy that claims
all human interactions should be voluntary and free from
<a href="Coercion" class="wikilink" title="coercion">coercion</a>. The
ideology was coined by <a href="Auberon_Herbert" class="wikilink"
title="Auberon Herbert">Auberon Herbert</a> in the 19th century and was
revived in the late 20th century by so-called
<a href="Anarcho-Capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalists">anarcho-capitalists</a> and other
right-libertarians in the
<a href="United_States" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a>.

**Important Note on Terminology:** There is a critical distinction
between **voluntarism** (the general principle that association should
be voluntary) and **Voluntaryism** (the specific right-libertarian
ideology). Anarchists are voluntarists in the sense that they support
voluntary association and oppose coercion. However, anarchists are not
Voluntaryists and reject Voluntaryism as an ideology. The addition of
the letter 'y' marks the difference between a general principle that
anarchists embrace and a specific capitalist ideology that anarchists
oppose. Not all voluntarists are anarchists, and anarchists are not
Voluntaryists.

Despite some superficial similarities in terminology, Voluntaryism is
fundamentally incompatible with
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>.
While anarchists support voluntary association as a necessary condition
for <a href="Liberty" class="wikilink" title="liberty">liberty</a>,
Voluntaryism's endorsement of
<a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a>,
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
and <a href="Hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> relationships directly contradicts
anarchist principles. Many modern Voluntaryists incorrectly identify as
"anarcho-capitalists" and claim their ideology represents a form of
anarchism, representing a fundamental misunderstanding of both
anarchism's history and its core principles of opposition to all forms
of hierarchy and domination.

## Origins

### 19th Century Voluntaryism

The term **voluntaryism** was coined by
<a href="Auberon_Herbert" class="wikilink"
title="Auberon Herbert">Auberon Herbert</a> (1838-1906), a British
philosopher who advocated for a minimal state funded entirely through
voluntary taxation rather than compulsion.[^1] Significantly, Herbert
explicitly rejected being called an anarchist and disagreed with
anarchist ideas. He considered anarchism to be "founded on a fatal
mistake" that would result in "pandemonium."[^2]

Herbert stressed that voluntaryists "should not direct our attacks – as
the anarchists do – against all government, against government in
itself" but "only against the overgrown, the exaggerated, the insolent,
unreasonable and indefensible forms of government." He emphasized: "we
are governmentalists," aiming for a government "formally constituted by
the nation, employing in this matter of force the majority method."[^3]

Other 19th century advocates of "voluntaryism" included various British
individualists who supported extreme
<a href="Laissez-faire" class="wikilink"
title="laissez-faire capitalism">laissez-faire capitalism</a>. Like
Herbert, these thinkers did not call themselves anarchists and were
aware of the anarchist movement but saw their ideas as distinct from it.

### Modern Revival

The term was revived in 1982 when George H. Smith, Wendy McElroy, and
Carl Watner began publishing *The Voluntaryist* magazine, appropriating
the term on behalf of right-libertarianism.[^4] This modern iteration
explicitly endorses <a href="Anarcho-Capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a> and claims to
represent a form of anarchism, despite voluntaryism's historical
rejection of anarchist principles.

## Core Concepts

### The Non-Aggression Principle

Central to Voluntaryism is the
**<a href="Non-Aggression_Principle" class="wikilink"
title="Non-Aggression Principle">Non-Aggression Principle</a>** (NAP),
which prohibits the initiation of
<a href="Force" class="wikilink" title="force">force</a> against persons
or property. Voluntaryists claim this principle as the foundation for a
free society.

However, the NAP relies on a propertarian definition of aggression that
anarchists reject. By defining any violation of private property as
"aggression," the NAP transforms the defense of hierarchy and inequality
into an ethical imperative. The principle ignores how private property
itself is established and maintained through violence, and how
capitalist property relations create structural coercion even without
direct physical force.

### Private Property

A defining feature of Voluntaryism is its unqualified support for
capitalist <a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> rights. Voluntaryists
claim that private property can exist without state enforcement and that
property relationships are inherently voluntary.

This represents a fundamental break with anarchism, which has always
opposed private property in the means of production.
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon&#39;s">Proudhon's</a> first anarchist work was titled
"<a href="What_is_Property?" class="wikilink"
title="What is Property?">What is Property?</a>" precisely to critique
the coercive nature of private property. He concluded that "property is
theft" and "property is despotism."[^5]

### Self-Ownership and Voluntary Servitude

Voluntaryism is built on the concept of
**<a href="Self-Ownership" class="wikilink"
title="Self-Ownership">Self-Ownership</a>** – the idea that individuals
own themselves and therefore have the right to sell their labor and
enter into hierarchical employment relationships. This concept leads to
the logical conclusion that individuals can "voluntarily" sell
themselves into servitude.

Anarchists reject self-ownership as a philosophical foundation because:

- It treats human beings as property, reducing persons to things that
  can be owned
- It is rooted in <a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
  title="private property">private property</a> ideology that only
  benefits property owners
- It attempts to justify voluntary servitude by framing it as an
  exercise of freedom
- It ignores the social conditions and power imbalances that constrain
  real choice

As
<a href="Carole_Pateman" class="wikilink" title="Carole Pateman">Carole
Pateman</a> argues, "to promise to obey is to deny or to limit, to a
greater or lesser degree, individuals' freedom and equality and their
ability to exercise these capacities \[of independent judgement and
rational deliberation\]."[^6] If individuals truly own themselves, then
they cannot alienate this ownership without ceasing to be free agents.
As <a href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" class="wikilink"
title="Rousseau">Rousseau</a> argued, sovereignty "for the same reason
as makes it inalienable, cannot be represented" – neither can it be sold
nor temporarily nullified by a hiring contract.

The anarchist position is clear: voluntary servitude is still servitude.
Freedom must mean more than the right to choose one's master. To
paraphrase Rousseau: "Under capitalism the worker regards herself as
free; but she is grossly mistaken; she is free only when she signs her
contract with her boss. As soon as it is signed, slavery overtakes her
and she is nothing but an order taker."[^7]

## Anarchist Critique

### Voluntary in Name Only

The central anarchist criticism of Voluntaryism is that it defines
"voluntary" in a way that ignores structural coercion and power
imbalances. While anarchists support voluntary association, we recognize
that formal consent is meaningless when people face systematic
constraints on their choices.

Under
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
workers must sell their labor to survive. As
<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a>
put it, "For the worker who must sell his labour, it is impossible to
remain free."[^8] The choice between wage labor and starvation is not a
free choice. As
<a href="Albert_Parsons" class="wikilink" title="Albert Parsons">Albert
Parsons</a> noted, "those disinherited of their natural rights must hire
out and serve and obey the oppressing class or starve. There is no other
alternative."[^9]

Voluntaryism ignores these material realities and treats all agreements
as equally voluntary regardless of the circumstances under which they
are made. This allows it to justify hierarchical and exploitative
relationships by claiming they were "voluntarily" entered into.

### Capitalism Requires a State

Voluntaryists claim to oppose the state while supporting capitalist
property relations. This is contradictory because
<a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> requires systematic
enforcement that only a state (or state-like institution) can provide.

Private property allows individuals to claim ownership over land and
resources they do not personally use or occupy. This is distinct from
<a href="Possession" class="wikilink" title="possession">possession</a>
(personal property actively used by an individual). For others to
recognize these absentee ownership claims, there must be an enforcement
mechanism – a concentrated form of hierarchical violence identical in
function to a state. Private property requires the enforcement of the
state as no single person can use and/or occupy a whole slew of land by
themselves and as such it cannot be recognized as personal property.
Thus to get people to follow your supposed ownership you need a form of
hierarchical violence to enforce it.

The Voluntaryist distinction between "voluntary" private defense
agencies and "coercive" states is superficial. Both involve the same
authority structures – a monopoly on legitimate violence over a given
territory. As <a href="Murray_Rothbard" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> himself admitted, in his
ideal society "Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own
just property" – exactly the same "ultimate decision-making power over a
given territorial area" he condemned when exercised by states.[^10]

### Wage Labor is Hierarchy

Voluntaryism explicitly endorses
<a href="Wage_Labor" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">wage labor</a>
and workplace hierarchy as compatible with freedom. This directly
contradicts anarchism's fundamental opposition to all forms of
domination.

When a worker signs an employment contract, they agree to obey the
commands of their employer during working hours. This relationship of
subordination persists regardless of whether the initial contract was
"voluntarily" signed. As
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a> argued, employees are "subordinated,
exploited" and their "permanent condition is one of obedience."[^11]

The employment contract is a promise to obey. Such a promise, as Pateman
notes, requires individuals to surrender their capacity for independent
judgment and rational deliberation – the very capacities that
Voluntaryism claims to protect.[^12]

Anarchists have consistently opposed this, advocating instead for
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a> and
cooperative organization. As Proudhon argued, workers must form
"democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of
a relapse into feudalism."[^13]

### The Conflation of Capitalism and Markets

Many Voluntaryists conflate
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
with <a href="Market" class="wikilink" title="markets">markets</a>,
assuming opposition to the former means opposition to the latter. This
is historically and theoretically incorrect.

Markets have existed for thousands of years across various economic
systems. Capitalism – defined by private ownership of the means of
production, wage labor, and production for profit – only emerged around
400-500 years ago during the early Renaissance period. It was
established through violent processes including the
<a href="Enclosure" class="wikilink" title="enclosure">enclosure</a> of
common lands, colonialism, and primitive accumulation.

Many anarchists, including
<a href="Mutualism" class="wikilink" title="mutualists">mutualists</a>
and <a href="Market_Anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="market anarchists">market anarchists</a>, support markets while
opposing capitalist property relations. The key distinction is between
markets based on
<a href="Possession" class="wikilink" title="possession">possession</a>
and <a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="worker control">worker control</a> versus markets based on
absentee ownership and exploitation.

### Historical Appropriation

Modern Voluntaryists claiming to be anarchists engage in historical
revisionism by:

- Ignoring that their own ideological forefathers (like Auberon Herbert)
  explicitly rejected anarchism
- Claiming <a href="Individualist_Anarchism" class="wikilink"
  title="individualist anarchists">individualist anarchists</a> like
  <a href="Benjamin_Tucker" class="wikilink"
  title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> as predecessors while
  ignoring that Tucker identified as a
  <a href="Socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialist">socialist</a>
  and opposed capitalism
- Appropriating the term "anarchist" despite anarchism's 150+ year
  history of opposition to capitalism
- Conflating their support for hierarchy with anarchism's foundational
  opposition to hierarchy (an-archy = no-archy, not hier-archy)

As
<a href="Iain_McKay" class="wikilink" title="Iain McKay">Iain McKay</a>
argues: "The idea that there is a form of anarchism which is not
anti-capitalist thus strikes anarchists as extremely strange. The idea
of capitalists raising the black flag, the flag of working class
insurrection and strikes, is a joke, a joke in extremely bad
taste."[^14]

## Why Voluntaryism Is Not Anarchism

Anarchism, from its origins with
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon">Proudhon</a>, has been explicitly anti-capitalist and
opposed to all forms of hierarchy and domination. While anarchists are
**voluntarists** (supporters of voluntary association), **Voluntaryism**
as a specific right-libertarian ideology contradicts anarchist
principles through its support for private property, wage labor, and
capitalist hierarchy.

As <a href="Pyotr_Kropotkin" class="wikilink"
title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> noted about an earlier generation of
capitalist individualists: the "modern Individualism initiated by
Herbert Spencer is, like the critical theory of Proudhon, a powerful
indictment against the dangers and wrongs of government, but its
practical solution of the social problem is miserable — so miserable as
to lead us to inquire if the talk of 'No force' be merely an excuse for
supporting landlord and capitalist domination."[^15]

Anarchists recognize that voluntarism without social equality and
without opposition to all hierarchy is meaningless. True voluntary
association requires:

- <a href="Economic_democracy" class="wikilink"
  title="Economic democracy">Economic democracy</a> and
  <a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
  title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>
  rather than wage labor
- <a href="Possession" class="wikilink" title="Possession">Possession</a>
  (use-based property rights) rather than private property
- <a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">Mutual aid</a>
  and cooperation rather than market competition
- Opposition to all forms of domination, not just the state

As the
<a href="An_Anarchist_FAQ" class="wikilink" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An
Anarchist FAQ</a> explains: "Voluntarism implies promising, and
promising implies that individuals are capable of independent judgement
and rational deliberation. In addition, it presupposes that they can
evaluate and change their actions and relationships. Contracts under
capitalism, however, contradict these implications of voluntarism."[^16]

Therefore, while anarchists are voluntarists in the sense that we
support voluntary association, we recognize that voluntarism alone is
insufficient without social equality and opposition to hierarchy.
Voluntaryism – with its support for capitalism and hierarchy –
represents a betrayal of genuine voluntary association.
