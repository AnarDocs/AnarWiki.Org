# State

## Overview

A **state** is a political organization that claims a monopoly on the
legitimate use of violence within a defined territory, and exercises
centralized control over a population through codified laws,
hierarchical <a href="Social_Hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> power structures, and organized
institutions.[^1] The state maintains its authority through various
means including military force, legal systems, taxation, and ideological
justification.

According to
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>,
states are defined by their anti-democratic nature, excluding most
people from making decisions about how society is run—either through
explicitly undemocratic regimes (dictatorships) or by maintaining a
facade of democracy through elections that fail by inertia and complex
legal <a href="bureaucracy" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>
(<a href="Representative_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a>). States
represent the most obvious and violent form of
<a href="Social_Hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="social hierarchy">social hierarchy</a> in the world today, and
their dissolution is a necessary part of the project for human freedom.

States emerged approximately 5,500 years ago alongside the development
of agriculture, writing systems, and social stratification.[^2] For most
of human prehistory, people lived in stateless societies characterized
by decentralized authority and relatively egalitarian social relations.

Modern political discourse treats the state as a necessary and
legitimate institution, but this view is contested across different
political philosophies. Understanding the state requires examining both
how it functions empirically and how different theoretical frameworks
justify or critique its existence.

## Origins

The ultimate origin of the state remains contested in political theory.
Several frameworks attempt to explain how states emerged.

### Primary State Formation

*Primary States* are states that developed in stateless societies that
had no contact with other states. The earliest primary states emerged in
Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes
around 3500 BCE. These early states developed alongside several key
factors:

**Agricultural Surplus**: The cultivation of grain crops (wheat, barley,
rice, millet) created storable surpluses that could be taxed and
concentrated. Unlike root crops or perishable foods, grains had long
shelf lives that made them valuable to both rulers and potential
raiders. Societies cultivating grains tended to develop hierarchical
structures with ruling elites who collected taxes, while societies
relying on root crops did not develop such hierarchies.[^3]

Many theorists argue that the
<a href="Neolithic_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Neolithic Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> led to the rise of
states, as the use of <a href="agriculture" class="wikilink"
title="agriculture">agriculture</a> enabled much more production of food
per person. This meant that people could specialise in tasks other than
gathering food, and the control of food production and distribution
ensured that a society based on class emerged, with the state emerging
to enforce class society.

Critics point out that many agricultural societies did not develop
states—some even remained strongly non-hierarchical—such as
<a href="Highland_New_Guinea" class="wikilink"
title="Highland New Guinea">Highland New Guinea</a>,
<a href="Aboriginal_Australia" class="wikilink"
title="Aboriginal Australia">Aboriginal Australia</a>, and the
<a href="Haudenosaunee_Confederacy" class="wikilink"
title="Haudenosaunee">Haudenosaunee</a>.

**Irrigation Systems**: In regions like ancient Egypt, large-scale
irrigation required coordination among many farmers. Managing flood
waters and constructing canal networks created natural monopolies with
substantial fixed costs, strengthening elite power and enabling control
over both land and water resources.[^4]

**Urbanisation**: Some theorists argue that as people began to migrate
from the countryside into cities—to be closer to others for protection
and to access greater food sources from agriculture—the resulting large
populations required urban planning and military defense, only possible
through collective agreement to create a state.

This theory has been strongly criticised as it fails to offer exact
dates and archaeological evidence for its claims. The first urban
environments
(<a href="Catal_Huyuk" class="wikilink" title="Catal Huyuk">Catal
Huyuk</a> and
<a href="Cayonu_Tepesi" class="wikilink" title="Cayonu Tepesi">Cayonu
Tepesi</a>) show no evidence of a state, and the largest urban
environments during the formation of states
(<a href="Indus_River_Valley_Civilization" class="wikilink"
title="Indus River Valley">Indus River Valley</a> and
<a href="Minoan_Crete_Civilization" class="wikilink"
title="Minoan Crete">Minoan Crete</a>) likewise show no evidence of
state structures.

**Writing and Bureaucracy**: The development of writing systems allowed
for centralization of information, record-keeping, taxation, and
coordination across larger territories. Bureaucratization made expansion
over large territories possible.

**Military Competition**: Interstate warfare created strong incentives
for rulers to extract resources, build military capacity, and
consolidate central authority. States that failed to mobilize resources
effectively were conquered by those that succeeded.

**Social Stratification**: Early states were characterized by highly
stratified societies with privileged ruling classes subordinate to
monarchs. Ruling classes differentiated themselves through architecture,
cultural practices, and control over religious institutions.

**Religious Legitimation and Control**: Organized religion provided
ideological justification for state power. Rulers claimed divine
authority (pharaohs as gods, Mandate of Heaven, divine right), co-opted
religious institutions, and used priestly classes to collect taxes and
teach obedience. States favored certain religious and ethnic groups
while marginalizing others. "Promised land" ideologies justified
conquest as divine will. This fusion of religious and political power
made resistance appear sacrilegious, strengthening control while
obscuring coercion.

### Secondary State Formation

*Secondary States* refer to states developed, aided, or influenced by an
already existing state over a stateless population. Contact with
existing states—through trade, warfare, or diplomatic pressure—often
catalysed state formation in neighbouring societies that might otherwise
have remained stateless.

### Tertiary State Formation

*Tertiary States* refers to states created by direct intervention and
administration by a fully formed state, in order to restore state power
to previously statist populations in which state authority had been
weakened or destroyed, or to impose its authority on a population that
had previously resisted full integration under a state. Colonial states
imposed by European empires represent clear examples of tertiary state
formation.

### Post-State Formation

*Post-State Society* refers to societies consisting of people who once
lived in a state and faced injustice, soon leaving the state to form
their own non-state communities that develop their own unique culture.
Examples include
<a href="Zomia" class="wikilink" title="Zomia">Zomia</a>, where
populations in the Southeast Asian highlands deliberately adopted social
structures, agricultural practices, and even oral (rather than written)
cultures specifically designed to resist state incorporation.

## Justifications

Various ideologies across the political spectrum have attempted to
justify the state, collectively known as *statism*. These justifications
can be understood both analytically and critically.

### Divine Right of Kings

Many early states claimed legitimacy by appealing to religious theories,
asserting that god had granted the ruling class the right and duty to
rule over populations. This idea is also called *theocracy*. Theocracies
largely collapsed with the Enlightenment and rise of secular ideals,
although theocratic ideals still guide the states of
<a href="Saudi_Arabia" class="wikilink" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi
Arabia</a>, <a href="Iran" class="wikilink" title="Iran">Iran</a>,
<a href="Mauritania" class="wikilink" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>,
<a href="Sudan" class="wikilink" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>,
<a href="Afghanistan" class="wikilink"
title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>,
<a href="Vatican_City" class="wikilink" title="Vatican City">Vatican
City</a>, and parts of
<a href="Israel" class="wikilink" title="Israel">Israel</a> and the
<a href="United_States_of_America" class="wikilink" title="USA">USA</a>.

### Social Contract

Social contract arguments, exemplified by thinkers like John Locke,
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and John Rawls, posit that individuals have
consented—either explicitly or tacitly—to surrender some of their
freedoms and submit to authority in exchange for protection of their
remaining rights or maintenance of social order.

**Core Claims**:

- The state emerges from rational individuals escaping the "state of
  nature" where rights are insecure
- Individuals possess natural rights (life, liberty, property) that
  exist prior to the state
- People consent to state authority in exchange for protection of their
  rights
- The state acts as a neutral arbiter between competing private
  interests
- Legitimacy derives from popular sovereignty and constitutional
  constraints

Critics of the social contract argue that tacit consent is
meaningless—if you do not cooperate with state demands (break a law,
stop paying taxes, avoid conscription), the state will coerce you. This
suggests the state is not a legitimate entity but a very successful
gang.

### Progressive Statism

Progressive statists argue that humanity has natural tendencies toward
bigotry and inequality, and that the state can step in as a progressive
agent to alleviate poverty and enforce equality, thus improving people's
lives. This is generally the view of
<a href="Liberalism" class="wikilink" title="liberals">liberals</a> and
<a href="Social_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="social democrats">social democrats</a>.

Modern welfare liberalism extends this by arguing the state must
actively enable freedom through material conditions—that markets create
inequalities undermining equal liberty, and that the state must correct
market failures and provide public goods.

Critics counter that the state frequently aids in the creation of
artificial poverty and bigotry, inventing and violently enforcing
arbitrary concepts of
<a href="gender" class="wikilink" title="gender">gender</a>,
<a href="race" class="wikilink" title="race">race</a>, and
<a href="class" class="wikilink" title="class">class</a>, as well as
destroying the
<a href="commons" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a>,
attacking
<a href="Squatting" class="wikilink" title="squats">squats</a>,
<a href="Repression_of_Trade_Unions" class="wikilink"
title="repressing trade unions">repressing trade unions</a>, and
privatising key public services—all organisations that clearly help
people escape deprivation.

Anti-statist progressives (like anarchists) argue that the state only
grants small concessions to prevent greater unrest that might threaten
its existence, or to accumulate more power and wealth (funding universal
healthcare because healthier citizens are more economically productive),
then exploits the giving of these concessions as propaganda.

### Defense of Revolution

Some states—notably <a href="Authoritarian_Socialism" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian socialist">authoritarian socialist</a> ones—have
claimed legitimacy by stating that a state is necessary for defending
revolutionary gains from outside counter-revolution. The Marxist
position holds that revolutionary seizure of state power is necessary to
transform economic relations, with the "dictatorship of the proletariat"
using state power transitionally to suppress counter-revolution before
the state eventually "withers away."

Critics put forth the <a href="Hydra_Hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="hydra hypothesis">hydra hypothesis</a>: that statism and
hierarchy actually make counter-revolution easier to succeed, while
decentralised insurgencies against oppression can last far longer.
Anarchists further argue that every attempt to use state power for
liberation has created a new ruling class—the USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam
all produced state capitalism and bureaucratic dictatorship rather than
communism.

### Will to Power

<a href="Will_to_Power" class="wikilink" title="Will to Power">Will to
Power</a> arguments hold that states are essentially gangs, and that
this is acceptable—whoever can take power is justified in holding it.
This view is difficult to argue against since it is nihilistic, and
nihilists rarely engage with ethical reasoning.

### Libertarian Minimal State

Libertarian thinkers like Robert Nozick, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton
Friedman argue for a minimal "night watchman" state necessary only for
core functions: defense, police, and courts. They argue pure anarchy
cannot reliably protect rights, but any state beyond minimal functions
constitutes illegitimate coercion—taxation for redistribution being
"forced labor" that violates rights.

### Conservative Justifications

Burkean conservatism conceives the state as an organic institution
embodying accumulated wisdom. Society is "a partnership between the
living, the dead, and those yet to be born" (Edmund Burke). The state is
not a voluntary contract but an inherited obligation; individuals are
born into obligations that are inherited, not chosen. Legitimacy derives
from tradition, historical continuity, and organic connection to
people's actual lives.

Authoritarian conservatism and fascism treat the state as the highest
expression of collective will—"Everything within the state, nothing
outside the state, nothing against the state" (Benito Mussolini).
Individual liberty is subordinate to state and national interests.

### Neo-Conservative Realism

Neo-conservative realism views the state primarily through international
competition. States are primary actors in an anarchic international
system with no world government to enforce order. States must pursue
national interest and maximize power; domestic politics is secondary to
international competition.

Interestingly, this analysis converges with anarchist state theory
(particularly Alan Carter's work) in recognizing that interstate
military competition drives state behavior and requires surplus
extraction. However, realists view this as justification for state
power, while anarchists see it as condemnation.

### No Justification

Some argue that no ethical justification for the state exists—these
thinkers are usually known as
<a href="Philosophical_Anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="philosophical anarchists">philosophical anarchists</a>. They
contend that the state invents stories to justify its own existence. The
burden of proof for the need for a state lies with those making the
claim. We are born without any knowledge of a state and can live without
one—those who claim the necessity of a state are making an extraordinary
claim, and the burden is on them to justify it. As economic historian
Robert Higgs argues:

> "In debates between anarchists and statists, the burden of proof
> clearly should rest on those who place their trust in the state.
> Anarchy's mayhem is wholly conjectural; the state's mayhem is
> undeniably, factually horrendous."[^5]

<a href="Peter_Gelderloos" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">Peter Gelderloos</a> further argues that
ideological conditioning prevents most people from even questioning
statist assumptions:

> Religion, history, citizenship, nationality, and identity as we know
> it all train us to be incapable of imagining our lives outside of
> state authority. All of us grow up believing that the State is an
> inevitable and universal evolution for humankind that improved the
> quality of our lives; only later are we given access to the
> information that conflicts with this narrative, once it already

> are relegated to the shadowy backdrop of a stage the State clearly
> commands.[^6]

## Conceptions of the State

Different political philosophies offer fundamentally different
understandings of what the state is, why it exists, and whether it can
be legitimate. These competing conceptions reflect deeper disagreements
about human nature, freedom, power, and social organization.

### Marxism

Marxist theory views the state as determined by economic relations and
class struggle.

**Core Claims**:

- The state arises from class struggle and serves the ruling class
- The state is the "executive committee of the bourgeoisie" under
  capitalism
- Social contract theory is ideological fiction masking exploitation
- The state cannot be neutral in a class society
- After proletarian revolution, the state will eventually "wither away"

**Orthodox Marxist View of State Autonomy**: The state has no autonomous
interests separate from the economic base. State form and function are
determined by the mode of production and serve the ruling class's
interests.

### Anarchism

Anarchism fundamentally rejects the legitimacy of all states and views
them as inherently oppressive institutions.

**Core Claims**:

- The state is a coercive institution based on domination, not consent
- Social contract theory ignores actual history of conquest and violence
- The state has autonomous interests separate from society
- Even "democratic" states rule through coercion and cannot be
  consensual
- Domination cannot be made legitimate through any process

**Historical Origins**: Anarchists reject social contract mythology.
States emerged through conquest, violence, and exploitation, not
voluntary agreement. The historical record shows states arising from
military competition and the need to extract surplus to fund coercive
forces.

**The State's Autonomous Interests**: Drawing on theorists like Alan
Carter, anarchists argue the state has imperatives independent of any
particular class:

- **Military competition** with other states requires maintaining
  coercive capacity
- **Surplus extraction** to fund military and administrative apparatus
- **Self-perpetuation** and expansion of state power
- **Creation of its own ruling class** (bureaucrats, military officers,
  police)

This explains why Marxist revolutions consistently failed to produce
stateless societies. Any group controlling state apparatus acquires
interests in maintaining and expanding that power, regardless of
revolutionary ideology.

**Why States Select Inequality**: States require extractable surplus to
maintain coercive forces for interstate competition. Egalitarian
economic relations do not generate easily extractable surplus.
Therefore, states systematically select and maintain inegalitarian
economic relations (whether capitalist, state socialist, or other forms)
because inequality concentrates resources that can be extracted. This
means no state can serve egalitarian ends—the institution itself
requires and perpetuates inequality.

**Critique of Reform**: Because the state has autonomous interests
requiring inequality, it cannot be reformed to serve egalitarian or
liberatory purposes. Using state power to achieve anarchist ends is
self-contradicting—the means (hierarchical domination) undermines the
ends (horizontal freedom).

**Alternative Organization**: Anarchists advocate abolishing states
entirely and building horizontal alternatives through mutual aid,
federation, voluntary cooperation, and prefigurative organizing. Free
association, direct democracy, and decentralized coordination can meet
genuine social needs without coercive hierarchy.

## Comparative Analysis

The following table summarizes key differences between major conceptions
of the state:

| Aspect | Liberal (Classical) | Liberal (Welfare) | Conservative | Marxist | Anarchist |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Origin** | Social contract | Social contract + historical evolution | Organic tradition | Class struggle | Conquest/domination |
| **Legitimacy** | Consent + rights protection | Consent + equality promotion | Tradition + order | Serves ruling class (illegitimate) | None (inherently illegitimate) |
| **Purpose** | Protect negative rights | Enable positive freedoms | Preserve tradition/order | Maintain class rule | Extract surplus, self-perpetuation |
| **Scope** | Minimal (classical) or Extensive (welfare) | Extensive | Varies by tradition | Total (under capitalism) | Expansionary tendency |
| **Interests** | Neutral arbiter | Promoter of justice | Guardian of order | Bourgeoisie's interests | Its own (autonomous) |
| **Relation to economy** | Enforces contracts | Regulates markets | Preserves property/hierarchy | Determined by economic base | Selects economic relations |
| **Can be reformed?** | Yes, through democracy | Yes, progressively | Only gradually | No, must be seized | No, must be abolished |
| **End state** | Permanent (limited government) | Permanent (democratic state) | Permanent (evolving slowly) | Withers away | Must be destroyed |

## Key Theoretical Divides

### Is the State Voluntary or Coercive?

**Liberals** argue the state is voluntary through social contract and
consent. Even if ancestors consented, emigration remains possible.
Democracy represents ongoing consent.

**Conservatives** view the state as neither voluntary nor coercive, but
organic and natural. Individuals are born into obligations that are
inherited, not chosen.

**Marxists** argue the state is coercive class domination. The
"contract" is ideological fiction masking exploitation by the
bourgeoisie's dictatorship.

**Anarchists** argue the state is coercive domination. Contract theory
ignores actual history of conquest and violence. Even "democratic"
states rule through coercion. True consent to domination is impossible.

### Is the State Neutral or Partisan?

**Liberals** claim the state is a neutral arbiter above competing
interests, enforcing rules impartially and protecting everyone's rights
equally.

**Conservatives** view the state as a neutral guardian preserving order
for all, maintaining civilization above class interests.

**Marxists** argue the state is partisan, serving the ruling class. It
is the "executive committee of the bourgeoisie" that cannot be neutral
in class society, using ideology to pretend neutrality.

**Anarchists** argue the state is partisan, serving itself. It has
autonomous interests and creates its own ruling class (bureaucrats,
military, police). Claims of "neutrality" are legitimation strategies.

### Does the State Have Agency and Interests?

**Liberals** say no—the state is a tool created by and serving citizens,
with no interests beyond those of constituents, controlled through
democratic mechanisms.

**Conservatives** say somewhat—the state embodies tradition and
represents the nation/community across time, making it more than the sum
of individuals but not entirely independent.

**Orthodox Marxists** say no—the state reflects the economic base, has
no autonomous interests, and is merely an instrument of the ruling
class.

**Anarchists** say YES—the state has its own imperatives (military
competition, surplus extraction). It creates its own ruling class with
distinct interests and acts to preserve and expand itself. This is Alan
Carter's key contribution, explaining why Marxist revolutions
failed—states have autonomous interests requiring inequality.

### The Hidden Agreement

Liberals, conservatives, and orthodox Marxists all agree the state CAN
serve the common good (or claim to):

- **Liberals**: Through democracy and rights protection
- **Conservatives**: Through tradition and order
- **Marxists**: After revolution, through workers' state
  (transitionally)

Only anarchists argue the state CANNOT serve the common good because it
has irreconcilable interests of its own that structurally require
inequality and domination.

## Anarchist Critique

### Against Liberal and Conservative Justifications

The mainstream liberal/conservative position claims: "The state is
necessary for civilization. Without it: chaos, insecurity, war of all
against all."

Anarchists respond on three grounds:

**Empirical**: Many societies functioned well without states—indigenous
peoples, medieval free cities, revolutionary Spain 1936-1939,
contemporary examples like Rojava and Zapatista territories. Stateless
does not mean orderless.

**Theoretical**: The state CREATES many problems it claims to solve.
Interstate warfare, artificial scarcity through property enforcement,
crime from inequality, and systematic oppression are products of state
systems, not solutions to pre-political chaos.

**Strategic**: Genuine alternatives exist through mutual aid,
federation, and voluntary cooperation. Horizontal organization can meet
real social needs without coercive hierarchy.

**Carter's Addition**: States systematically select inegalitarian
economic relations to serve their interests in military competition and
surplus extraction. Any state—including a revolutionary state—will
reproduce inequality because the institution itself requires extractable
surplus to maintain coercive capacity.

### Against Marxist Justifications

The Marxist position claims: "The state under capitalism serves the
bourgeoisie, but can be seized and used for proletarian purposes
transitionally before withering away."

Anarchists respond:

**Empirical**: Every attempt to use state power for liberation created a
new ruling class—USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam, etc. The pattern is
consistent: revolutionary seizure of state power produces state
capitalism and bureaucratic dictatorship, not communism.

**Theoretical**: The state has autonomous interests (Carter's
State-Primacy Theory). Any group controlling state apparatus develops
interests in maintaining coercive capacity for military competition.
This requires surplus extraction, which requires maintaining inequality.
The state cannot "wither away" because these imperatives are structural.

**Strategic**: Using state power perpetuates domination rather than
ending it. The means (hierarchical control) contradict the ends
(classless society). Prefigurative politics—building horizontal
alternatives now—is necessary rather than seizing centralized power for
later transformation.

## Revolutionary Strategy

Different conceptions of the state generate different approaches to
change:

**Liberals**: Reform through democratic process. Vote, petition,
protest. Gradual progress through institutions. Revolution justified
only when state violates rights, and only to re-establish liberal
democracy.

**Conservatives**: Oppose revolutionary change. Support gradual
evolution only. Revolution destroys accumulated wisdom. Preserve what
works, change slowly.

**Marxists**: Revolutionary transformation of economic base. Seize state
power. Establish transitional dictatorship of the proletariat. Transform
economic relations. State withers away once classes are abolished.

**Anarchists**: Simultaneous abolition and construction. Destroy state
apparatus entirely. Build horizontal alternatives through prefigurative
organizing. No transition period using state power, as this reproduces
domination. Direct action, mutual aid, and federation now rather than
waiting for post-revolutionary transformation.

## Tendencies

Within anarchist theory, several tendencies offer different emphases
while sharing rejection of state authority:

**Anarcho-Communism**: Emphasizes abolition of both state and
capitalism, common ownership, production for need, "from each according
to ability, to each according to need."

**Anarcho-Syndicalism**: Focuses on revolutionary labor unions as means
to abolish state and capitalism, with workers' self-management of
production through federations of unions.

**Insurrectionary Anarchism**: Emphasizes permanent conflict with power,
rejection of formal organizations that could become hierarchical, and
spontaneous uprising rather than gradual building.

**Platformism**: Argues for coordinated anarchist organization with
theoretical and tactical unity while maintaining anti-authoritarian
principles.

**Post-Left Anarchism**: Critiques traditional anarchist movement's
focus on mass organizing, emphasizing individual autonomy, rejection of
work, and lifestyle anarchism.

Despite tactical differences, all anarchist tendencies agree that states
are inherently illegitimate institutions requiring domination and
inequality that must be abolished rather than reformed or seized.

## Criticism

Anarchist state theory faces several common objections:

**Large-Scale Coordination**: Critics argue states are necessary for
coordinating large-scale activities like infrastructure, defense, and
complex economies. Anarchists respond that voluntary federation, mutual
aid networks, and horizontal coordination can meet these needs.
Historical examples like anarchist Catalonia (1936-1939) demonstrated
industrial production and territorial defense without state hierarchy.

**Free Rider Problems**: Critics claim voluntary systems cannot prevent
free riding. Anarchists argue that small-scale, face-to-face communities
create social pressure for contribution, while federation allows larger
coordination. Additionally, much "free riding" is actually resistance to
exploitative systems.

**Violence and Security**: Critics argue only states can prevent
violence and provide security. Anarchists respond that states are the
primary source of organized violence (war, police brutality, genocide).
Community self-defense, restorative justice, and addressing root causes
of violence (poverty, oppression) offer alternatives to state policing.

**Transition Period**: Marxists argue a transitional state is necessary
to suppress counter-revolution and coordinate economic transformation.
Anarchists counter that every such "transitional" state has become
permanent, with revolutionary leaders becoming new ruling classes. The
means (state power) inevitably corrupt the ends (liberation).

**Human Nature**: Some argue humans are too selfish, violent, or stupid
to organize without hierarchy. Anarchists respond that human behavior
reflects social conditions—most of human history involved
non-hierarchical organization. Hierarchy is learned, not innate.
