The Informal Anarchist Federation, or *Federazione Anarchica Informale*
(FAI) is an insurrectionist network that began in Italy and has since
spread to Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, the
Netherlands, Peru, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. In 1999, people under the FAI banner sent mail bombs to a Greek
embassy in Italy and a tourism office and Citibank branch in Spain. Over
the next few years, the FAI bombed various corporate and state targets
in western Europe, mainly in Italy and Spain. However, the current
iteration of the FAI, as an adoptable monkier with a distinguished
philosophy, can be traced to late 2003 and early 2004 in Bologna,
Italy.[^2]

On 28 December 2003, a mail bomb exploded at the the European Commission
head Romano Prodi's Bologna home. Over the next few days, six bombs were
mailed to state targets across western Europe. Even though they were
discovered and diffused before exploding, Bologna stopped package
deliveries to European Union institutions.[^3] Taking responsibility for
the action, FAI members published an "Open Letter to the Anarchist &
Anti-Authoritarian Movement" at the end of 2003. The letter proclaimed
the federation's aims and structure:

> "We strongly believe that only a chaotic and horizontal organisation,
> without bosses, authorities or central committees taking decision, can
> fulfil our need for freedom here and now. Our goal is to have an
> organisation reflecting the view of the anarchist society, which we
> struggle for."[^4]

They expressed opposition to democracy, which they associated with
"representatives, delegates, official meetings, committees, and organs
implying the election of leaders, charismatic figures and the imposition
of specialists of speech." They also rejected Marxism as "nothing more
than a fascinating and dangerous siren that claims freedom for the
oppressed but actually denies the possibility of a free society and just
substitutes one dominion with another."[^5]

The letter gave both philosophical and strategic reasons for having a
decentalized and informal structure. Philosophically, they "do not
believe in vanguards nor do we think that we are an enlightened active
minority. We just want to live as anarchists here and now."
Strategically, they emphasize that the autonomy and anonymity of each
cell makes the federation as a whole much harder for authorities to
infiltrate: "if by some unfortunate chance infiltrators or informers
should come out, this would affect a single group without spreading to
others."[^6]

According to sympathetic chroniclers, the FAI between December 2003 and
December 2006 carried out "7 campaigns...\[and\] 30 incendiary and
explosive attacks on things and people" (according to sympathetic
researchers).[^7]

On 7 May 2012, masked FAI members non-fatally shot the nuclear-power
company executive Roberto Adinolfi in Genoa.[^8]

The FAI has strongly supported the Conspiracy of Cells of Fire since the
latter network's emergence in 2008. Several FAI actions in 2014 were
jointly claimed with the
