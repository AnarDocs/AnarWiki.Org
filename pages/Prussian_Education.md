**Prussian Education** or **Forced Schooling** refers to an ideal of
<a href="education" class="wikilink" title="education">education</a>
that stands in stark contrast to democratic education. Prussian
Education developed out of what is now
<a href="Germany" class="wikilink" title="Germany">Germany</a> in the
late 18th century and argues that students should be subject to a strict
timetable, curriculum and lecture-style classrooms. Students are
subjected to constant monitoring and their progress is logged
mathematically and 'graded', doling out rewards to students.

The strongest critics of Prussian Education argue that it constitutes
indoctrination towards the worship of authority figures and often
engages in historical whitewashing (or denialism) to make the
<a href="State_(Polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> look
better. Others acknowledge these criticisms as valid, but recognise the
role these schools have in preventing children being forced into harsh
working conditions and occasionally helping against poverty.

## History

*Note: Libertarian Socialist historians tend to develop an understanding
of Prussian Education from a critical perspective. This conflicts with
mainstream history and is possibly wrong, if sources are incorrect,
please edit.*

## Flaws

### Inefficiency

Compared to <a href="Democratic_Education" class="wikilink"
title="democratic education">democratic education</a>, prussian
education also has inferior outcomes in terms of student academic
achievement, student critical thinking skills and student happiness.

### Confusing

Since students lack any kind of control over their learning and classes
are not tailored to individual student needs, schools will often be
incredibly confusing for students as they are either overwhelmed by what
they are learning and

### Apathy

Because of their lack of control over their education and frequently
being punished for attempting to take control of it (such as by reading
things not part of the course), students often do not care about what
they are learning and will often forget most of it after graduating.

### Emotional Manipulation

Schools frequently instill feelings of guilt into students.

## Purposes

### Colonialism

Forced Schooling played a strong role in wiping out indigenous cultures
in order to eliminate the ability of these cultures to

<a href="Reverse_Dominance_Hierarchy" class="wikilink"
title="reverse dominance hierarchies">reverse dominance hierarchies</a>
in order to aid the military objectives of
<a href="colonialism" class="wikilink"
title="colonialism">colonialism</a>. This is done by wiping out
language, kinship, family ties, cultural knowledge, history and other
traditions. Examples of this include the Stolen Generations in
<a href="Stolen_Generation_(Australia)" class="wikilink"
title="Australia">Australia</a> and
<a href="Stolen_Generation_(New_Zealand)" class="wikilink"
title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> as well as Residential Schools in
the
<a href="Residential_Schools_(USA)" class="wikilink" title="USA">USA</a>,
Mexico and <a href="Residential_Schools_(Canada)" class="wikilink"
title="Canada">Canada</a>. In addition to the rampant verbal, emotional,
physical and sexual abuse that occurred in these institutions. Many
psychologists believe the forced assimilation of native cultures has
contributed to their high suicide rates and poverty.[^1]

### Statism

According to <a href="Peter_Gelderloos" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Gelderloos">Peter Gelderloos</a>:

> <a href="Anti-Capitalism" class="wikilink"
> title="Anticapitalists">Anticapitalists</a> will often insist that the
> purpose of public education is to prepare workers. This is balderdash,
> a perfect example of dogma obviating reality. The vast majority of the
> lesson plan, once a pupil is literate and knows the most basic maths,
> is irrelevant to the tasks of the future worker, unless we count the
> abilities to follow orders, accept confinement, and complete
> meaningless tasks; however, those skills are required of all citizens,
> employed or unemployed, prole or petty-bourgeoisie. A typical worker
> has absolutely no need to know about ancient Egypt, William
> Shakespeare, or basic chemistry. No, the fundamental purpose of
> education is to civilize children, and a large part of this means
> filling their heads with the lies that are necessary to make them
> always view history and society from the perspective that privileges
