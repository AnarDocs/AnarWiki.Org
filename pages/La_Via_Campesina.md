# La VÃ­a Campesina

**La VÃ­a Campesina** (from Spanish *la vÃ­a campesina*, meaning the
peasant way) is an international farmers organization founded in 1993 in
<a href="Mons" class="wikilink" title="Mons">Mons</a>,
<a href="Belgium" class="wikilink" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. The
network comprises an estimated 200 million peasants, fishers and
small-scale farmers organized through 182 organisations in 81
countries,[^1] describing itself as "an international movement which
coordinates peasant organizations of small and middle-scale producers,
agricultural workers, rural women, and indigenous communities from Asia,
Africa, America, and Europe".[^2]

With a decentralized structure, they are autonomous from NGOs and
political parties. Their website is

## History

### Background and approach

Starting in the 1980s governments were intervening less in the rural
countryside, which weakened corporate control over peasants'
organizations while making a living in agriculture become more
difficult.[^3] As a result, national peasant groups began to form ties
with transnational organizations, starting in Latin America and then on
a global scale.[^4]

The peasants' rights movement emerged from the new rights advocacy which
had arisen in the 1990s; during that time, human rights and development
agendas became integrated which expanded from political and civil rights
to include social and economic rights.[^5] The agrarian peasants'
movement moved to challenge the hegemonic ideology of
<a href="neoliberalism" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a> in global economics and to find
alternatives that would protect the rights of workers around the
world.[^6]

### Founding

The organization was founded in 1993 by farmers organizations from
Europe, Latin America, Asia, North America, Central America and
Africa.[^7] The foundation followed the Uruguay Round of the
<a href="General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade" class="wikilink"
title="General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade">General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT), where the
<a href="World_Trade_Organization" class="wikilink"
title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO)'s
<a href="Agreement_on_Agriculture" class="wikilink"
title="Agreement on Agriculture">Agreement on Agriculture</a> and the
<a href="Trade-related_Intellectual_Property_Rights" class="wikilink"
title="Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights">Trade Related
Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS) were signed and approved.[^8]
These agreements caused backlash from many people around the world for
focusing on technical problems rather than the human right to access to
food, especially for those living in the Global South.[^9] Globalization
was under way at this time, affecting many industries including
agriculture.[^10] La VÃ­a Campesina gave small farmers a platform to have
their voices heard about how these changes were impacting their
lives.[^11]

### Relation to international entities

The movement has grown and is now recognized as a part of the global
dialogue on food and agriculture. It has presented in several
international fora, such as:

- The <a href="Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_of_the_United_Nations"
  class="wikilink"
  title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations">Food and
  Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</a> (FAO)[^12]
- The <a
  href="International_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_New_Varieties_of_Plants"
  class="wikilink"
  title="International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants">International
  Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants</a> (UPOV)[^13]
- The <a href="UN_Human_Rights_Council" class="wikilink"
  title="UN Human Rights Council">UN Human Rights Council</a> (HRC)[^14]
- The
  <a href="World_Intellectual_Property_Organization" class="wikilink"
  title="World Intellectual Property Organization">World Intellectual
  Property Organization</a> (WIPO)

Via Campesina has been involved in the negotiations[^15] of the
<a href="United_Nations_Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Peasants"
class="wikilink"
title="United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other people living in Rural areas">United

Rural areas</a>, adopted by the
<a href="United_Nations_General_Assembly" class="wikilink"
title="UN General Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> in December

## Philosophy

### Food Sovereignty

In 1996, LVC coined the term "food sovereignty" which they define as
"the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food
produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their
right to define their own food and agriculture systems."[^17] This
concept was introduced at the World Food Summit in 1996 and differs from
<a href="food_security" class="wikilink" title="food security">food
security</a>. The phrase "culturally appropriate" signifies that the
food that is available and accessible for the population should fit with
the cultural background of the people consuming it.

Food security was defined as "physical, social, and economic access to
sufficient, safe, and nutritious food... at all times to meet \[the
population's\] dietary and food preferences for an active and healthy
life"[^18] and is more focused on the provision of food for all by
whatever means necessary, whether by local production or global imports.
As a result, economic policies concerned with food security typically
emphasize <a href="industrial_farming" class="wikilink"
title="industrial farming">industrial farming</a> that can produce more
food cheaper.[^19]

### Anti-Capitalism and Feminism

La Via Campesina strongly opposes capitalism and patriarchy.[^20] LVC
identifies the root causes of climate change in: "Current global modes
of production, consumption and trade... a development model based on
capital concentration, high fossil energy consumption, overproduction,
consumerism and trade liberalization."[^21]

In recent years, the movement has placed greater emphasis on gender
issues and women's rights, and strengthened its opposition to
<a href="transnational_corporations" class="wikilink"
title="transnational corporations">transnational corporations</a>.[^22]

### Agroecology

Strongly opposing industrial agriculture and genetic modification, LVC
is committed to agroecology, which combines modern ecological science
with traditional understandings in order to achieve sustainable
small-scale food production. The movement considers true agroecology to
be intrinsically radical and feminist:

> "\[a\]groecology is political; it requires us to challenge and
> transform structures of power in society. We need to put the control
> of seeds, biodiversity, land and territories, waters, knowledge,
> culture and the commons in the hands of the peoples who feed the
> world."
>
> "We women among us are not objects of policies that want to empower
> us, but rather we are active subjects of Agroecology and guardians of
> Biodiversity. We want our central role in food production and in the
> reproduction of life, as well as in the economy of our families and
> communities, to be visible and recognized. Agroecology means that our
> rights as women are protected and realized, not just as mothers and
> caregivers of our homes. Agroecology implies our full participation in
> the social and political life of our communities, ensuring our access
> to land, water, seeds"[^23]

Noting the potential of such methods to be less greenhouse gas intensive
and perhaps even able to draw down carbon into the soil, LVC believes
that "Peasant agroecology cools the Earth." LVC believes there is an
urgent need to decentralize food production and "to reduce meat
consumption and improve its distribution in accordance with what is
simultaneously ecologically, nutritionally and culturally
appropriate."[^24]

The anti-capitalist movement's decentralized structure and direct
action-oriented strategy have much in common with the horizontal
unionist tendency of <a href="Green_Syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="Green Syndicalism">Green Syndicalism</a>. Some researchers have
found overlaps between LVC's approach and the philosophy of
<a href="Ecofeminism" class="wikilink"
title="Ecofeminism">Ecofeminism</a>.[^25]

### Food Regimes

Friedmann defines a
<a href="Food_regimes" class="wikilink" title="food regime">food
regime</a> as a "rule governed structure of production and consumption
of food on a world scale".[^26] A food regime is marked by a period of
transition in food production that results in significant social,
political, and economic change.[^27] The current situation of global
food production can be called the "corporate food regime" due to the
concentration of supplying and processing food in the private
sector.[^28] For example, US corporations have control over food
production by subcontracting smaller farmers, which allows them to
participate and profit without taking on the risks of farming, such as
weather and disease.[^29]

Food regimes are the result of "political struggles among contending
social groups" for control over how food production is framed and
conceptualized, according to McMichael.[^30] The corporate food regime
came about with the <a href="Neoliberalism" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberal">neoliberal</a> economic theory which is motivated by
efficiency and trade liberalization, and states that nations should
focus their efforts and resources on producing goods and services where
they have an advantage relative to other nations. The corporate food
regime has existed for only the last 100 years, as compared to the
millennia prior to <a href="industrialization" class="wikilink"
title="industrialization">industrialization</a> and the
<a href="Green_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>.[^31]

### Peasant Identity

La VÃ­a Campesina has focused on gaining recognition for the discourse
around food sovereignty, reclaiming the term "peasant" and recreating a
shared peasant identity across national borders and cultures.[^32] The
reclaiming of this identity has been called "re-peasantization".[^33]

According to Desmarais (2008), the term "peasant" in English has a
connotation related to
<a href="feudalism" class="wikilink" title="feudalism">feudalism</a>,
but in other languages and contexts, the meaning is broader; *campesino*
comes from the word *campo*, meaning "countryside", which ties the
people to the land.[^34] This feudalist connotation is one reason why
the organization chose not to translate its name into English.[^35]

### Priorities

According to La Via Campesina's webpage, the movement's main issues are
promoting food sovereignty; demanding agrarian reform; people's control
over land, water, territories; resisting free-trade; promoting popular
peasant feminism; upholding human rights, rights of migrant workers;
promoting agroecology; promoting peasant seeds systems; increasing the
participation of youth in agriculture.[^36]

## Organisation

La VÃ­a Campesina is a grassroots movement, with activism at the local
and national level. LVC has a decentralized structure, with the vast
majority of decision-making and organizing taking place at the local and
national levels. Members come from 81 countries, organised into 9
regions.[^37][^38]

Each region has a face-to-face decision-making assembly that nominates 3
delegates to meet at the International Conference every 3 to 4 years.
That conference forms the International Coordinating Commission with 2
representatives, one man and one woman, from each region, plus one youth
per continent, each elected by their respective region's member
organisations.[^39][^40] The International Coordinating Commission is
the main organizing body at the global level.[^41]

With about 182 local and national organisations as part of the movement,
La Via Campesina represents an estimated 200 million farmers around the
world.[^42]

Democratic decision-making is central to the mission of La VÃ­a
Campesina, and it has been dedicated to fair representation and
engagement of all participants, making structural changes when
necessary.[^43] The perspectives of people around the world are needed
to assess and improve global food production and sovereignty.[^44]

According to Michael Menser, La Via Campesina is an example of the
success and expansion of transnational movements in regards to
<a href="participatory_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="participatory democracy">participatory democracy</a> due to its
organization model and adaptation to ensure fair representation.[^45]

### Women's involvement

Because an estimated 70 percent of the world's farmers are women, LVC is
especially committed to involving women at all levels of
decision-making. The LVC's Women's Assembly meets before each
international meeting and their deliberations are taken seriously by the
International Coordinating Commission which itself requires half of
delegates to be women.[^46]

Gender was ignored as a consideration at the start of the movement. At
the signing of the Managua Declarationâ€”the precursor to La VÃ­a
Campesinaâ€”all eight people present were men.[^47] Peasant women started
to become more involved and pushing for women's rights at the
International Conference in Tlaxcala in 1996.[^48] At this meeting, they
decided to form a committee dedicated to women's rights and gender
issues, which eventually became the VÃ­a Campesina's Women's
Commission.[^49]

The women on the committee were heavily involved in editing the draft of
the cornerstone position on food sovereignty that was presented at the
<a href="World_Food_Summit" class="wikilink"
title="World Food Summit">World Food Summit</a> in 1996.[^50] They
included health as a consideration for food production without
agro-chemicals, as well as the importance of women's involvement in
policy changes because women typically were barred from political
involvement.[^51] The women of La VÃ­a Campesina are still working for
greater representation and engagement of peasant women, especially in
leadership positions.

## Activities

LVC runs about 70 schools and training processes[^52] and has organized
and participated in many mobilizations. One report summarizes that La
Via Campesina members "have walked together in the streets of Geneva,
Paris, Seattle, QuÃ©bec City, Quito, Rome, Johannesburg, Porto Alegre,
CancÃºn, Hong Kong, Copenhagen, and Durban, among other major cities.
Whenever and wherever international institutions like the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) meet
to discuss agricultural and food issues, La Via Campesina is
there."[^53]

In 2017, LVC members participated in a horizontally-organized blockade
that temporarily shut down an open-pit coal mine in Hambach, Germany.
The thousands of blockaders organized horizontally and were influenced
by ideas of queer feminism and North-South solidarity.[^54]

La VÃ­a Campesina also partners with other social movements and
<a href="non-governmental_organization" class="wikilink"
title="non-governmental organization">non-governmental organizations</a>
(NGOs) to strengthen its international presence.[^55]

### Member Organizations

LVC's member organizations include Brazil's
<a href="Landless_Workers&#39;_Movement" class="wikilink"
title="Landless Workers&#39; Movement">Landless Workers' Movement</a>
which has seized land where 150,000 families currently reside.

LVC has supported
<a href="15th_Garden" class="wikilink" title="15th Garden">15th
Garden</a> movement, a horizontally-structured and anti-Assadist urban
farming movement in Syria. The name 15th garden comes from the March
15th anniversary of the <a href="Syrian_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Syrian Revolution">Syrian Revolution</a>.[^56]

LVC's Cuban affiliate ANAP led the campesino-to-campesino (farmer to
farmer) movement that spread agroecological techniques which
dramatically improved both per-hectare and per-hour productivity.[^57]
