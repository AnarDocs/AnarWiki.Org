# Alexander Garden Obelisk

The **Alexander Garden Obelisk** is a monument in
<a href="Moscow.md" class="wikilink" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>,
<a href="Russia.md" class="wikilink" title="Russia">Russia</a> with a
complicated and ironic history. Originally erected in 1914 to celebrate
the 300th anniversary of the <a href="Romanov_Dynasty.md" class="wikilink"
title="Romanov Dynasty">Romanov Dynasty</a>, it was transformed by the
Bolsheviks in 1918 into a monument commemorating socialist thinkers -
including two prominent
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
and one proto-anarchist, despite the fact that the new Soviet state was
simultaneously suppressing the anarchist movement. In 2013, the monument
was dismantled and replaced with a replica of the original Romanov
monument, erasing this brief moment of anarchist commemoration.

## The Romanov Monument (1914-1918)

The original obelisk was designed by Sergey Aleksandrovich Vlasev and
erected on July 10, 1914, near the entrance to
<a href="Alexander_Garden.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Garden">Alexander Garden</a> by the
<a href="Kremlin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> walls.
Made of Finnish
<a href="granite.md" class="wikilink" title="granite">granite</a>, it was
crowned with a double-headed eagle and featured the coat of arms of the
Romanov <a href="boyars.md" class="wikilink" title="boyars">boyars</a>. The
monument listed the names of all Romanov rulers from Mikhail Fyodorovich
to <a href="Nicholas_II_of_Russia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nicholas II">Nicholas II</a>, along with the coats of arms of
various Russian provinces.[^1]

The monument cost up to 50,000
<a href="rubles.md" class="wikilink" title="rubles">rubles</a>, funded by
the Moscow city Duma. It stood for only four years before the
<a href="October_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a> transformed both
Russia and the monument itself.

## Transformation Under Lenin (1918)

Following the <a href="October_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="October Revolution">October Revolution</a>,
<a href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>
implemented his "plan of monumental propaganda," which called for
removing monuments to tsars and erecting new monuments honoring
"fighters of the revolution of all times and peoples."[^2]

In August-September 1918, the Alexander Garden Obelisk was transformed
rather than destroyed:

- The double-headed eagle was removed from the top (reportedly with help
  from Latvian Riflemen)
- The coats of arms were removed
- <a href="Saint_George.md" class="wikilink" title="Saint George">Saint
  George</a> was replaced with "R.S.F.S.R." and
  "<a href="Proletarians.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Proletarians">Proletarians</a> of all countries, unite!"
- The names of the Romanov rulers were removed and replaced with 19
  names of social thinkers and political figures

The selection of names was approved by Lenin and entrusted to prominent
Bolshevik <a href="Vladimir_Friche.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Friche">Vladimir Friche</a>. The monument was renamed
"Monument-Obelisk to Outstanding Thinkers and Personalities of the
Struggle for the Liberation of Workers" and unveiled in October 1918 to
mark the first anniversary of the Revolution.

## The Names: A Diverse Socialist Tradition

## The Irony of Anarchist Commemoration

The inclusion of Proudhon and Bakunin on this Leninist monument
represents one of history's more profound ironies. At the very moment
this monument was being erected in October 1918, the Bolshevik
government was beginning its systematic suppression of the anarchist
movement in Russia.

Throughout 1918-1921, the Bolsheviks would:

- Raid anarchist organizations and meeting places
- Imprison thousands of anarchists
- Execute anarchist leaders
- Crush the anarchist-influenced
  <a href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Kronstadt Rebellion">Kronstadt Rebellion</a> (1921)
- Suppress the <a href="Makhnovist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine

The monument thus commemorates anarchist thinkers whose ideas the Soviet
state was actively working to eliminate. Bakunin had famously warned
that
<a href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>
<a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;">"dictatorship of the
proletariat"</a> would become a new form of tyranny - a prediction that
proved accurate as the Bolsheviks consolidated power.

The list notably includes only deceased figures, avoiding any living
anarchists or Bolsheviks who might later fall out of favor. Even so,
several of the honored figures - Mikhaylovsky, Bakunin, and Plekhanov -
represented tendencies that would be suppressed or opposed by the
Bolshevik regime.

## Later History

In 1966, the monument was moved from the garden entrance to its center
to make way for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier memorial.

### Return to Romanov Glorification (2013)

On July 2, 2013, without prior public announcement, the monument was
dismantled. Officials claimed this was necessary because the monument
had tilted and posed a safety threat, and that restoration was needed.
However, critics noted that the dismantling occurred just after a new
monument to Patriarch Hermogenes had been erected nearby, and coincided
with the 400th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty.

The "restoration" that followed was widely criticized by
preservationists and historians. The architectural group
<a href="Arhnadzor.md" class="wikilink" title="Arhnadzor">Arhnadzor</a>
declared that "the original of 1914 has not been raised, and the
original 1918 died. In Alexander Garden is now showing off a replica,
not a monument of any era."[^3] Sculptor Nikolai Avvakumov identified
numerous errors and inaccuracies in the reconstruction, including
spelling errors and images that didn't match the original.

By November 4, 2013, the monument had been rebuilt - but as a replica of
the original 1914 Romanov monument, complete with the double-headed
eagle, Romanov names, and imperial symbolism. The names of the socialist
thinkers, including Proudhon and Bakunin, were erased.

This transformation completed a full historical circle: from Romanov
glorification (1914-1918), to socialist commemoration (1918-2013), and
back to Romanov glorification (2013-present). The return to monarchist
symbolism reflected the increasingly nationalist and conservative
direction of post-Soviet Russia under
<a href="Vladimir_Putin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>.

## Significance

The Alexander Garden Obelisk's history encapsulates several important
themes:

**The Bolshevik Appropriation of Anarchist History**: The monument shows
how the Bolsheviks were willing to claim anarchist thinkers as part of a
broader "socialist" tradition when it suited their propaganda purposes,
even as they violently suppressed actual anarchist organizing.

**The Diversity of Socialist Thought**: The monument's 19 names
demonstrate that socialism encompasses far more than Marxism - including
anarchism, <a href="utopian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian socialism">utopian socialism</a>, democratic socialism,
and various other tendencies. The dominance of Marxism-Leninism in 20th
century socialism was a historical contingency, not an inevitability.

**The Erasure of Radical History**: The 2013 replacement of the monument
with a Romanov replica shows how states erase inconvenient radical
histories. The brief period when anarchist thinkers were officially
commemorated in the heart of Moscow has now been literally built over.

**Anarchist Vindication**: Bakunin's inclusion on the monument,
alongside his later persecution by the Soviet state, serves as a grim
vindication of his warnings about
<a href="authoritarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian socialism">authoritarian socialism</a>. He
predicted that Marxist revolution would create a new ruling class - and
the history of the monument itself proves him right.
