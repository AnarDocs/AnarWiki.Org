# Anarcho-pacifism

**Anarcho-pacifism**, also referred to as **anarchist pacifism** and
**pacifist anarchism**, is an
"<a   href="anarchist_school_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist school of thought">anarchist school of thought</a> that
advocates for the use of peaceful, non-violent forms of resistance in
the struggle for
"<a   href="social_change.md" class="wikilink" title="social change">social
change</a>.[^1][^2] Anarcho-pacifism rejects the principle of
"<a   href="violence.md" class="wikilink" title="violence">violence</a> which
is seen as a form of power and therefore as contradictory to key
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
ideals such as the rejection of hierarchy and dominance.[^3][^4]

Many anarcho-pacifists are also
"<a   href="Christian_anarchists.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchists">Christian anarchists</a>, who reject war
and the use of violence.[^5] Anarcho-pacifists reject the use of
violence, but accept non-violent revolutionary action against
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and the "<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> with
the purpose of establishing a peaceful
"<a   href="voluntaryism.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntarist">voluntarist</a> society.[^6][^7]

## Origins

The main early influences on anarcho-pacifism were the philosophies of
"<a   href="Henry_David_Thoreau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> and
"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>, while later the ideas of
"<a   href="Mahatma_Gandhi.md" class="wikilink" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma
Gandhi</a> gained significance.[^8][^9] Anarcho-pacifist movements
primarily emerged in the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom and the
United States before and during
"<a   href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a>.[^10]

### Early Influences

"<a   href="Henry_David_Thoreau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> (1817–1862) was an
important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the
United States and Europe. Thoreau's essay
""<a   href="Civil_Disobedience.md" class="wikilink"
title="Civil Disobedience">Civil Disobedience</a>" (*Resistance to Civil
Government*) was named as an influence by
"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>,
"<a   href="Martin_Buber.md" class="wikilink" title="Martin Buber">Martin
Buber</a>,
"<a   href="Mahatma_Gandhi.md" class="wikilink" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma
Gandhi</a> and "<a   href="Martin_Luther_King_Jr..md" class="wikilink"
title="Martin Luther King Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> due to its
advocacy of "<a   href="nonviolent_resistance.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolent resistance">nonviolent resistance</a>.[^11] According
to the "<a   href="Peace_Pledge_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a> of Britain, it was
also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism.[^12]

Thoreau himself did not subscribe to pacifism, and did not reject the
use of armed revolt. He demonstrated this with his unqualified support
for
"<a   href="John_Brown.md" class="wikilink" title="John Brown">John Brown</a>
and other violent abolitionists,[^13] writing of Brown that "The
question is not about the weapon, but the spirit in which you use
it."[^14]

In the 1840s, the American abolitionist and advocate of

title="nonresistance">nonresistance</a>
"<a   href="Henry_Clarke_Wright.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry Clarke Wright">Henry Clarke Wright</a> and his English
follower
"<a   href="Joseph_Barker.md" class="wikilink" title="Joseph Barker">Joseph

title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>.[^15]

### The Tolstoyan Movement

At some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a>. The
"<a   href="Tolstoyan_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tolstoyan movement">Tolstoyan movement</a> in
"<a   href="Russia.md" class="wikilink" title="Russia">Russia</a> was the
first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement. Violence has always been
controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists embraced violent
"<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a> during the
nineteenth century, anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a
means for change.

"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a> argued that anarchism must be nonviolent since it is, by
definition, opposition to coercion and force, and that since the state
is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic.
"<a   href="Ferdinand_Domela_Nieuwenhuis.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis">Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis</a>
was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the
anarchist movement.[^16]

In France anti-militarism appeared strongly in
"<a   href="individualist_anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchist">individualist anarchist</a> circles, as
"<a   href="Émile_Armand.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Armand">Émile
Armand</a> co-founded "Ligue Antimilitariste" in December 1902 with
fellow anarchists
"<a   href="Georges_Yvetot.md" class="wikilink" title="Georges Yvetot">Georges
Yvetot</a>,
"<a   href="Henri_Beylie.md" class="wikilink" title="Henri Beylie">Henri
Beylie</a>, "<a   href="Paraf-Javal.md" class="wikilink"
title="Paraf-Javal">Paraf-Javal</a>,
"<a   href="Albert_Libertad.md" class="wikilink"
title="Albert Libertad">Albert Libertad</a> and
"<a   href="Émile_Janvion.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Janvion">Émile
Janvion</a>. The *Ligue antimilitariste* was to become the French
section of the
*"<a   href="Association_internationale_antimilitariste.md" class="wikilink"
title="Association internationale antimilitariste">Association
internationale antimilitariste</a>* (AIA) founded in Amsterdam in
1904.[^17]

### Gandhi and the Conquest of Violence

Tolstoy's philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by
"<a   href="Mohandas_Gandhi.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mohandas Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a>, an
"<a   href="Indian_independence_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Indian independence">Indian independence</a> leader and pacifist
who self-identified as an anarchist. Gandhi's ideas were popularised in
the West in books such as
"<a   href="Richard_Gregg.md" class="wikilink" title="Richard Gregg">Richard
Gregg</a>'s *The Power of Nonviolence* (1935), and
"<a   href="Bart_de_Ligt.md" class="wikilink" title="Bart de Ligt">Bart de
Ligt</a>'s *The Conquest of Violence* (1937).

The latter is particularly important for anarchists since, as one
himself, de Ligt specifically addressed those who lust for revolution.
"The more violence, the less revolution," he declared. He also linked
Gandhian principled "<a   href="nonviolence.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolence">nonviolence</a> with the pragmatic nonviolent direct
action of the syndicalists. The
"<a   href="General_Strike.md" class="wikilink" title="General Strike">General
Strike</a> is an expression of total noncooperation by workers, though
it should be added that most syndicalists believed that the revolution
should be defended by armed workers.[^18]

*The Conquest of Violence* alludes to Kropotkin's *The Conquest of
Bread*.[^19]

### Emergence as a Global Movement

As a global movement, anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before
"<a   href="World_War_II.md" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a> in the "<a   href="Netherlands.md" class="wikilink"
title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>,
"<a   href="United_Kingdom.md" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">United
Kingdom</a> and
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a> and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for
"<a   href="nuclear_disarmament.md" class="wikilink"
title="nuclear disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a>.

The American writer "<a   href="Dwight_Macdonald.md" class="wikilink"
title="Dwight Macdonald">Dwight Macdonald</a> endorsed anarcho-pacifist
views in the 1940s and used his journal *politics* to promote these
ideas.[^20]

Many young anarchists of this period departed from previous generations
both by embracing pacifism and by devoting more energy to promoting
avant-garde culture, preparing the ground for
"<a   href="the_Beat_Generation.md" class="wikilink"
title="the Beat Generation">the Beat Generation</a> in the process. The
editors of the anarchist journal *Retort*, for instance, produced a
volume of writings by WWII draft resistors imprisoned at Danbury,
Connecticut, while regularly publishing the poetry and prose of writers
such as "<a   href="Kenneth_Rexroth.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kenneth Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a> and
"<a   href="Norman_Mailer.md" class="wikilink" title="Norman Mailer">Norman
Mailer</a>. From the 1940s to the 1960s, then, the radical pacifist
movement in the United States harbored both social democrats and
anarchists, at a time when the anarchist movement itself seemed on its
last legs.[^21][^22]

A leading British anarcho-pacifist was
"<a   href="Alex_Comfort.md" class="wikilink" title="Alex Comfort">Alex
Comfort</a> who considered himself "an aggressive anti-militarist," and
he believed that pacifism rested "solely upon the historical theory of
anarchism."[^23][^24] He was an active member of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament.[^25]

Among the works on anarchism by Comfort is *Peace and Disobedience*
(1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for *Peace News* and the
"<a   href="Peace_Pledge_Union.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peace Pledge Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>, and *Authority and
Delinquency in the Modern State* (1950).[^26] He exchanged public
correspondence with
"<a   href="George_Orwell.md" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">George
Orwell</a> defending pacifism in the open letter/poem "Letter to an
American Visitor" under the pseudonym "Obadiah Hornbrooke."[^27]

### Post-War Development

In the 1950s and 1960s, anarcho-pacifism "began to gel, tough-minded
anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and
tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence".[^28]

Within the context of the emergence of the
"<a   href="New_Left.md" class="wikilink" title="New Left">New Left</a> and
the "<a   href="Civil_Rights_Movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Civil Rights Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, several themes,
theories, actions, all distinctly libertarian, began to come to the fore
and were given intellectual expression by the American anarcho-pacifist,
"<a   href="Paul_Goodman.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Goodman">Paul
Goodman</a>.[^29]

## Tendencies

### Christian Anarcho-Pacifism

Anarcho-pacifism is frequently associated with various forms of
religious anarchism such as Tolstoyan Christian anarchism and Buddhist
anarchism. Notably, "<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a> places emphasis on
"<a   href="Jesus_Christ.md" class="wikilink" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus
Christ</a>'s blessing of peacemakers and teachings involving non-violent
resistance.[^30]

Concerning the anarchistic characteristics of Christianity, Greek author
"<a   href="Alexandre_Christoyannopoulos.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexandre Christoyannopoulos">Alexandre Christoyannopoulos</a>
argues that the concept of the state should be rejected by Christians
due to its inherent contradiction of the teachings of the religion.[^31]

Following
"<a   href="Max_Weber.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>'s
definition of the state in his 1921 essay *Politics as a Vocation*,
Christoyannopoulos contends that the state is founded upon a monopoly
over the use of violent force in order to enforce law and order, and is
therefore directly at odds with the fundamental teachings of Jesus
Christ.[^32][^33]

Reflecting on the implications of this contradictory relationship,
Christoyannopoulos invokes the Tolstoyan notion that the force utilized
by the justice system to enforce the outcomes of legal proceedings is
also at odds with the teachings of Christianity.[^34]

"<a   href="Aylmer_Maude.md" class="wikilink" title="Aylmer Maude">Aylmer
Maude</a> (the friend, biographer and translator of
"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a>) states that Christianity involves anarchism as it
necessitates the "abolition of all compulsory legislation, law courts,
police, and prisons, as well as all forcible restraint of man by
man".[^35][^36]

Due to Tolstoy's religious views combined with his advocacy for the
total dismantlement of the state and its apparatus in favour of the
establishment of a voluntarist society, he is seen as a prominent
instigator of Christian anarchism.[^37][^38]

#### Notable Christian Anarcho-Pacifists

**Dorothy Day** (8 November 1897 – 29 November 1980) was an American
journalist, social activist and devout Catholic convert who advocated
the Catholic economic theory of "<a   href="distributism.md" class="wikilink"
title="distributism">distributism</a>. She was also considered to be an
anarchist,[^39][^40][^41] and did not hesitate to use the term.[^42]

In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist
"<a   href="Peter_Maurin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Maurin">Peter
Maurin</a> to establish the Catholic Worker movement, a nonviolent,
pacifist movement that continues to combine direct aid for the poor and
homeless with "<a   href="nonviolent_direct_action.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolent direct action">nonviolent direct action</a> on their
behalf. The cause for Day's canonization is open in the Catholic Church.

**Ammon Hennacy** (24 July 1893 – 14 January 1970) was an American
pacifist, Christian anarchist, vegetarian, social activist, member of
the Catholic Worker Movement and a Wobbly. He established the "Joe Hill
House of Hospitality" in Salt Lake City, Utah and practiced tax
resistance.

### Socialist Anarcho-Pacifism

Anarcho-pacifism is often combined with
"<a   href="socialist.md" class="wikilink" title="socialist">socialist</a>
criticism of capitalism regarding
"<a   href="economic_class.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic class">economic class</a>.[^43] The anarcho-pacifist
ideal of a peaceful classless society is claimed to be incompatible with
the competitive nature of capitalism which can ultimately lead to
violent conflict.[^44]

Anarcho-pacifists frequently denounce the perceived tendency of the
capitalist economic system to perpetuate systematic violence in the
forms of exploitation, hierarchies of political and economic power as
well as dispossession.[^45]

However, the socialist criticism of capitalism that often appear within
the movement does not imply that anarcho-pacifism is inherently social
anarchist in nature.[^46] Anarchist schools of thought can be generally
distinguished from one another by their perspectives on two key
elements, namely revolutionary methods and economic organisation.[^47]
Anarcho-pacifism differs from social anarchism in rejecting the use of
violent revolutionary methods to achieve social change and the abolition
of the state.[^48]

An anarcho-pacifist critique of capitalism was provided by
"<a   href="Bart_de_Ligt.md" class="wikilink" title="Bart de Ligt">Bart de
Ligt</a> in his *The Conquest of Violence*. All anarchists would agree
with de Ligt on "the absurdity of bourgeois pacifism." For de Ligt, and
all anarchists, violence is inherent in the capitalist system and any
attempt to make capitalism pacifistic is doomed to failure.

This is because, on the one hand, war is often just economic competition
carried out by other means. Nations often go to war when they face an
economic crisis, what they cannot gain in economic struggle they attempt
to get by conflict. On the other hand, "violence is indispensable in
modern society... \[because\] without it the ruling class would be
completely unable to maintain its privileged position with regard to the
exploited masses in each country. The army is used first and foremost to
hold down the workers... when they become discontented."

As long as the state and capitalism exist, violence is inevitable and
so, for anarcho-pacifists, the consistent pacifist must be an anarchist
just as the consistent anarchist must be a pacifist.[^49]

### Individualist Anarcho-Pacifism

Irreligious or even anti-religious tendencies have emerged such as the
French individualist anarchist anarcho-pacifist tendency exemplified by
authors and activists such as
"<a   href="Charles-Auguste_Bontemps.md" class="wikilink"
title="Charles-Auguste Bontemps">Charles-Auguste Bontemps</a>,
"<a   href="André_Arru.md" class="wikilink" title="André Arru">André Arru</a>
and "<a   href="Gérard_de_Lacaze-Duthiers.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers">Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers</a> which
aligned itself with
"<a   href="atheism.md" class="wikilink" title="atheism">atheism</a> and
"<a   href="freethought.md" class="wikilink"
title="freethought">freethought</a>.

**Charles-Auguste Bontemps** was a prolific author mainly in the
anarchist, freethinking, pacifist and naturist press of the time.[^50]
His view on anarchism was based around his concept of "Social
Individualism" on which he wrote extensively.[^51] He defended an
anarchist perspective which consisted on "a collectivism of things and
an individualism of persons."[^52]

**Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers** was a French writer, art critic, pacifist
and anarchist. Lacaze-Duthiers, an art critic for the Symbolist review
journal *La Plume*, was influenced by
"<a   href="Oscar_Wilde.md" class="wikilink" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar
Wilde</a>,
"<a   href="Nietzsche.md" class="wikilink" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> and
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">Max
Stirner</a>. His (1906) *L'Ideal Humain de l'Art* helped found the
'Artistocracy' movement – a movement advocating life in the service of
art.[^53] His ideal was an anti-elitist aestheticism: "All men should be
artists".[^54]

**Jean-René Saulière** (also René Saulière) (Bordeaux, 6 September 1911
– 2 January 1999) was a French anarcho-pacifist, individualist
anarchist[^55] and freethought writer and militant who went under the
pseudonym André Arru.[^56][^57][^58]

During the late 1950s he establishes inside the Fédération des Libres
Penseurs des Bouches du Rhône, the Group Francisco Ferrer[^59] and in
1959 he joins the Union des Pacifistes de France (Union of Pacifists of
France).[^60] From 1968 to 1982, Arru alongside the members of the Group
Francisco Ferrer publishes *La Libre Pensée des Bouches du Rhône*.

### Contemporary Movements

The "<a   href="anarcho-punk.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-punk">anarcho-punk</a> band
"<a   href="Crass.md" class="wikilink" title="Crass">Crass</a> polemicised a
variant of anarcho-pacifism whilst at the same time explicitly rejecting
all religions, especially the symbols of establishment Christian
theology.[^61]

"<a   href="Movement_for_a_New_Society.md" class="wikilink"
title="Movement for a New Society">Movement for a New Society</a> (MNS),
a national network of feminist radical pacifist collectives that existed
from 1971 to 1988,[^62] is sometimes identified as anarchist,[^63]
although they did not identify themselves as such.[^64]

MNS popularized consensus decision-making, introduced the spokescouncil
method of organization to activists in the United States, and was a
leading advocate of a variety of practices – communal living, unlearning
oppressive behavior, creating co-operatively owned businesses – that are
now often subsumed under the rubric of "prefigurative politics."[^65]

MNS leader George Lakey stated that "anarchists claim me but I'm always
a little surprised when they do because I'm fond of social democracy as
it's been developed in Norway." Lakey has supported electoral politics,
including the re-election of Barack Obama as U.S. president.[^66]

## Theory and Practice

### Core Principles

According to the authors of *An Anarchist FAQ*, "the attraction of
pacifism to anarchists is clear. Violence is authoritarian and coercive,
and so its use does contradict anarchist principles...
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Malatesta">Malatesta</a> is even more explicit when he wrote that
the 'main plank of anarchism is the removal of violence from human
relations'."[^67]

Anarcho-pacifists tend to see the state as 'organised violence' and so
they see that "it would therefore seem logical that anarchists should
reject all violence".[^68]

Anarcho-pacifism criticizes the separation between means and ends.
"Means... must not merely be consistent with ends; this principle,
though preferable to 'the end justifies the means', is based on a
misleading dichotomy. Means are ends, never merely instrumental but also
always expressive of values; means are end-creating or ends-in-the
making".[^69]

### Strategic Approaches

A main component of anarcho-pacifist strategy is
"<a   href="civil_disobedience.md" class="wikilink"
title="civil disobedience">civil disobedience</a> as advocated by the
early anarchist thinker "<a   href="Henry_David_Thoreau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> in the essay of the
same name from 1849 (although Thoreau strongly supported the gun rights
and self-defense).[^70]

"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo
Tolstoy</a> was influenced by it and he saw that a "great weapon for
undermining (rather than overthrowing) the state was the refusal by
individuals to cooperate with it and obey its immoral demands".[^71]
Also the concepts of passive and active resistance have relevance as
they were developed later by "<a   href="Mohandas_Gandhi.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mohandas Gandhi">Mohandas Gandhi</a>.[^72]

For anarchist historian "<a   href="George_Woodcock.md" class="wikilink"
title="George Woodcock">George Woodcock</a> "the modern pacifist
anarchists,...have tended to concentrate their attention largely on the
creation of libertarian communities – particularly farming communities –
within present society, as a kind of peaceful version of the propaganda
by deed. They divide, however, over the question of action."[^73]

Anarcho-pacifists can even accept "the principle of resistance and even
revolutionary action (nonviolent revolution), provided it does not incur
violence, which they see as a form of power and therefore nonanarchist
in nature. This change in attitude has led the pacifist anarchists to
veer toward the anarcho-syndicalists, since the latter's concept of the
"<a   href="general_strike.md" class="wikilink" title="general strike">general
strike</a> as the great revolutionary weapon made an appeal to those
pacifists who accepted the need for fundamental social change but did
not wish to compromise their ideal by the use of negative (i.e.,
violent) means."[^74]

Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists
from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action
provided it does not result in violence. It was their approval of such
forms of opposition to power that led some anarcho-pacifists to endorse
the anarcho-syndicalist concept of the general strike as the great
revolutionary weapon.[^75]

## Criticism

While anarcho-pacifism represents an important tendency within anarchist
thought, it has faced criticism from other anarchist tendencies who
argue that violent self-defense and revolutionary action may be
necessary to overthrow oppressive systems. The debate between pacifist
and non-pacifist anarchists continues to be a significant discussion
within anarchist movements.

Some anarchists argue that the state and capitalism will not relinquish
power through purely non-violent means and that armed self-defense is a
legitimate response to state violence. However, anarcho-pacifists
counter that the use of violence inevitably leads to the recreation of
hierarchical and authoritarian structures.
