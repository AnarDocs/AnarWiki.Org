murdered by <a href="Lenin" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>'s

symbol of
<a href="Bolshevik" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>
repression against the anarchist movement.

## Early Life

Born in 1887 in
<a href="Vilnius" class="wikilink" title="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, within
the
<a href="Russian_Empire" class="wikilink" title="Russian Empire">Russian
Empire</a>, Fanya moved with her family to the United States at a young
age, where they adopted the surname "Grefenson".[^1] In
<a href="Chicago" class="wikilink" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, she
established a relationship with the exiled Russian anarchist
<a href="Aron_Baron" class="wikilink" title="Aron Baron">Aron Baron</a>
(also known as Kantorovitch), who worked as a baker and had fled to
Chicago in 1912. Aron met Fanya through his older brother Newman
(Nahum), who was married to Fanya's older sister Sarah.

## Anarchist Activities in America

Fanya became deeply involved in Chicago's anarchist movement and the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW). She spent most of her time and money distributing
anarchist propaganda in the factory where she worked, giving "all her
spare time and a goodly part of her meagre earnings" to further the
anarchist cause.[^2]

She was active in the hunger demonstrations of 1915, working alongside
<a href="Lucy_Parsons" class="wikilink" title="Lucy Parsons">Lucy
Parsons</a> and Aron. On January 17, 1915, she led the Russian
Revolutionary Chorus at a meeting addressed by Lucy Parsons and others
at
<a href="Hull_House" class="wikilink" title="Hull House">Hull House</a>,
established by
<a href="Jane_Addams" class="wikilink" title="Jane Addams">Jane
Addams</a> to help the poor. During the demonstration that followed,
police viciously attacked the crowd using brass knuckles and billy
clubs. Fanya was knocked unconscious by one of the club-wielding
officers and was arrested along with five other Russian women and
fifteen men.[^3] Jane Addams arranged bail for Fanya and the other
arrested activists.

Fanya was also co-editor of **The Alarm**, the anarchist newspaper
edited by her husband Aron Baron and their comrade Lucy Parsons,
following the execution of Lucy's husband
<a href="Albert_Parsons" class="wikilink" title="Albert Parsons">Albert
Parsons</a> and the other <a href="Haymarket_Martyrs" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket Martyrs">Haymarket Martyrs</a>.

## Return to Russia and the Ukrainian Revolution

With the outbreak of the <a href="February_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a> in 1917, Fanya
returned to Russia with Aron and Boris Yelensky. They moved to
<a href="Ukraine" class="wikilink" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, where
they participated in the local workers' movement and helped establish
the <a href="Nabat" class="wikilink" title="Nabat">Nabat</a>, a
confederation of Ukrainian anarchists.[^4]

As <a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> recalled: "Baron was of the type of Russian woman completely
consecrated to the cause of humanity... Years afterward, when I met her
in Kharkov, her zeal and devotion had become intensified by the
persecution she and her comrades had endured since their return to
Russia. She possessed unbounded courage and a generous spirit."[^5]

The Nabat officially backed
<a href="Nestor_Makhno" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a>'s
<a href="Revolutionary_Insurgent_Army_of_Ukraine" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine">Revolutionary Insurgent
Army of Ukraine</a>, and Fanya traveled extensively throughout Ukraine
under dangerous conditions. Goldman noted: "Under harrowing conditions
of travel, Fanya went up and down the Ukraina to spread the Nabat,
organize the workers and peasants, or bring help and succour to her
imprisoned comrades."[^6]

## Arrest and Imprisonment

Following the defeat of the
<a href="White_Army" class="wikilink" title="White Army">White Army</a>
in November 1920, the
<a href="Bolsheviks" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>
turned against their anarchist allies. On November 25, 1920, members of
the Nabat, including Fanya and Aron Baron, were arrested by the Cheka at
a conference in
<a href="Kharkiv" class="wikilink" title="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a> and
transferred to Russian prisons.[^7]

In prison, Fanya endured brutal treatment. She was "one of the victims
of the Butyrki raid, when she had been dragged by her hair and badly
beaten," according to Goldman.[^8]

## Prison Escape and Recapture

On July 10, 1921, Fanya joined a prison break organized by the
<a href="Underground_Anarchists" class="wikilink"
title="Underground Anarchists">Underground Anarchists</a>, a clandestine
anarchist network. She managed to escape from Ryazan prison along with
nine other anarchists and made her way to Moscow on foot, arriving "in
tatters and penniless."[^9]

In Moscow, she sought refuge with Aron's brother Semion, who was a
member of the <a href="Communist_Party" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a>. She confided her plans to
help Aron escape from prison, but on August 17, 1921, she was discovered
and arrested by the Cheka at Semion's home. It remains unclear whether
he betrayed her, though the Cheka had planted agents among the
Underground Anarchists and arranged acts of provocation.

## Execution

Despite international protests and pressure for the release of anarchist
political prisoners, Fanya Baron was kept in custody along with the poet
<a href="Lev_Chernyi" class="wikilink" title="Lev Chernyi">Lev
Chernyi</a>.
<a href="Leon_Trotsky" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a> dismissed international concerns, declaring: "We do not
imprison the real anarchists, but criminals and bandits who cover
themselves by claiming to be anarchists."[^10]

On the night of September 29-30, 1921, Fanya Baron was executed without
charges or trial by the Cheka, found guilty of being an "accomplice of
anti-Soviet criminal acts." She was murdered alongside Lev Chernyi and
nine other anarchists. True to her ideals to the very end, her last
words were reportedly "long live anarchy."

According to Emma Goldman, Fanya "refused to go to her death meekly,"
and had to be carried to the spot of her execution by Cheka officers,
"fighting her executioners all the way."[^11]

## Legacy

Emma Goldman condemned the execution: "This big-hearted woman, who had
served the Social Revolution all her life, was done to death by the
people who pretended to be the advance guard of revolution. Not content
with the crime of killing Fanya Baron, the Soviet Government put the
stigma of banditism on the memory of their dead victim."[^12]

Fanya Baron's death became a powerful symbol of Bolshevik repression
against the anarchist movement. Her husband Aron Baron was later
executed during the
<a href="Great_Purge" class="wikilink" title="Great Purge">Great
Purge</a> in 1937, after spending 18 years in prison.

Decades after her execution, the
<a href="Sydney" class="wikilink" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>-based
<a href="Jura_Books" class="wikilink" title="Jura Books">Jura Books</a>
named its library the Fanya Baron Library in her honor, ensuring her
legacy as a committed anarchist and revolutionary continues to inspire
future generations.
