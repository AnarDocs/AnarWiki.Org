# Externalities

An **externality** is a cost or benefit that falls on someone other than
those directly involved in producing or consuming a good or service.
Under
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
corporations routinely shift the costs of production onto workers,
communities, and the natural environment while privatizing profits. This
systematic externalization of costs represents one of capitalism's
fundamental contradictions: the market price of goods reflects only a
fraction of their true social and environmental cost.

## The Problem

The negative examples are the most common, dealing with
<a href="pollution" class="wikilink" title="pollution">pollution</a>,
health harms, and environmental destruction imposed on populations who
gain nothing from the production process. The clearest example is air
pollution. A power plant that emits filthy, sooty smoke imposes costs on
its neighbors instead of bearing them itself. This causes overproduction
and inefficient resource use, since the producer does not suffer the
consequences of dirtying the air.

No business wants to bear the costs of its externalities, even if they
could calculate an objective cost, as these increase production costs
and product prices. This explains why many companies move factories to
countries with less stringent <a href="environmental" class="wikilink"
title="environmental">environmental</a> laws and regulations, where they
can dump anything they wish into the environment without concern.
<a href="Corporation" class="wikilink"
title="Corporation">Corporations</a> and entire industries have worked
diligently to avoid paying for externalities because of the large
profits that can be made through this cost-shifting.

Methods corporations use to avoid responsibility include:

- Outright bribery
- Congressional
  <a href="lobbying" class="wikilink" title="lobbying">lobbying</a>
- Writing legislation themselves (e.g.
  <a href="American_Legislative_Exchange_Council" class="wikilink"
  title="American Legislative Exchange Council">American Legislative
  Exchange Council</a>)
- <a href="Denialist" class="wikilink" title="Denialist">Denialist</a>
  <a href="public_relations" class="wikilink"
  title="public relations">public relations</a> campaigns
- Covering up research or information indicating hazards
- Legal delays—if affected people die, their heirs might not sue

### Profit Through Harm

Many
<a href="healthcare" class="wikilink" title="healthcare">healthcare</a>
insurance companies made substantial donations to Barack Obama's
election fund, despite him promising a public healthcare option that
would have competed directly with their services. When Obama became
President, he dropped the public option despite having a majority in
government. The donations appeared to buy influence, allowing
corporations to maintain their profits at the expense of public health.

Consider another example: SC Johnson, maker of Saran Wrap, voluntarily
stopped using Polyvinylidene chloride due to environmental and health
concerns. This made the product safer but reduced its effectiveness and
market share. Stories like this are as rare as they are telling—for
every CEO who defies shareholders to do the right thing, dozens of
industries knowingly poison people and the planet for profit.

The <a href="Bhopal_disaster" class="wikilink"
title="Bhopal disaster">Bhopal disaster</a>, in which a pesticide leak
at a Dow Chemical (then Union Carbide) factory in India killed as many
as 20,000 people, demonstrates the deadly consequences when corporations
externalize costs. The company paid roughly £2,400 (about \$3,000)
compensation per death before legal fees—a pittance compared to the
human toll.

## Types of Externalities

  economic development

### Negative Consumption Externalities

  title="Antibiotic resistance">Antibiotic resistance</a>** caused by
  increased usage—individuals do not consider the cost to others when
  making usage decisions

  title="Passive smoking">Passive smoking</a>**—shared costs of
  declining health imposed on non-smokers
- **<a href="Traffic_congestion" class="wikilink"
  title="Traffic congestion">Traffic congestion</a>**—increased road use
  creates waiting times, longer trips, and higher accident risk for all

- **<a href="Automobiles" class="wikilink"
  title="Automobile externalities">Automobile externalities</a>**—weak
  public infrastructure, air pollution,
  <a href="climate_change" class="wikilink" title="climate change">climate
  change</a>, resource depletion, and land consumption

### Positive Externalities

Positive externalities occur when production or consumption benefits
others without compensation:

- **<a href="Vaccination" class="wikilink"
  title="Vaccination">Vaccinations</a>** that reduce disease carriers
  and create
  <a href="herd_immunity" class="wikilink" title="herd immunity">herd
  immunity</a>
- **<a href="Education" class="wikilink" title="Education">Education</a>**
  that improves workers' performance beyond their current employer and
  provides broader social benefits
- **Research and development**—much of the economic benefit is not
  captured by the originating firm
- **Beekeepers** whose bees pollinate surrounding crops while producing
  honey

However, even positive externalities reveal market failure. Under
capitalism, goods with positive externalities are underproduced because
producers cannot capture all the benefits they create. This demonstrates
that markets fail to provide optimal outcomes even when activities
benefit society.

## Hidden Costs: The Case of Automobiles

The automobile industry provides a stark example of externalized costs.
What drivers pay at the pump represents only 18-25% of the true costs of
gasoline, with 75-82% shifted onto society through other means.[^1]

These hidden costs include:

- **Medical and pollution costs**—respiratory problems, cardiovascular
  diseases, birth defects, water contamination, neurological effects
- **Infrastructure costs**—road construction and maintenance paid
  through general taxation
- **Accident costs**—deaths, injuries, and property damage
- **Climate damage**—contribution to
  <a href="global_warming" class="wikilink" title="global warming">global
  warming</a> and associated disasters
- **Government subsidies**—direct financial support for the fossil fuel
  industry

If these costs were included at the pump, gasoline would cost
approximately \$20 per gallon (£3.60 per litre) rather than current
market prices. This would price most people out of personal vehicle
ownership, revealing automobile dependency as economically
unsustainable.

### Unquantifiable Costs

Beyond monetary costs, automobiles create social harms that resist easy
calculation:

- **Community fragmentation**—physical division of neighborhoods (often
  along racial lines) by major roads, reduced social interaction, loss
  of public gathering spaces
- **Health and wellbeing impact**—reduced physical activity from car
  dependency, mental health effects from noise and stress, limited
  children's independence
- **Economic distortion**—property devaluation near major roads, decline
  of local businesses, shift to car-dependent out-of-town retail
- **Environmental degradation**—habitat fragmentation, biodiversity
  loss, multiple pollution types, urban heat island effects
- **Public space loss**—conversion of green spaces to parking,
  demolition of historic buildings for road widening

People often discuss the loss of community cohesion since the 1930s-50s
without identifying automobiles as a cause. Yet the creation of suburbs,
out-of-town shopping, busing children to distant schools, industrial
agriculture replacing local food, and long commutes play enormous roles
in making society more fractured and lonely.

### Who Pays?

The externalized costs of automobiles create systematic injustice:

- Non-drivers subsidize drivers despite not benefiting directly
- Lower-income people subsidize higher-income car owners
- Public transport users double-pay—subsidizing roads while paying fares
- Rural residents typically subsidize urban infrastructure more per
  capita
- Future generations bear the costs of
  <a href="climate_change" class="wikilink" title="climate change">climate
  change</a> caused by current emissions

These costs remain largely hidden, disguising the true price of
automobile dependency and making alternatives appear more expensive than
they are.

## The Structure of Cost-Shifting

Externalities are not aberrations or market failures that can be
corrected through minor adjustments. They represent capitalism's normal
operating procedure. The business enterprise functions by systematically
shifting costs onto others to generate profit.

As economist Joan Martinez-Alier argues, the bulk of consumers affected
by externalities are future generations who have not been born yet and
therefore cannot participate in market decisions. The assumptions behind
future discounting—which presume future goods will be cheaper than
present goods—systematically devalue the wellbeing of those who will
inherit the environmental and social damage we create today.

### Why Externalities Persist

Several factors ensure externalities remain central to capitalist
production:

**Poorly defined property rights**—Air, water, and wildlife flow freely
across borders, making it difficult to assign ownership. This creates
incentives to consume resources without paying full costs.

**Transaction costs**—Even when property rights exist, the costs of
negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing agreements often exceed the
benefits, preventing those harmed from seeking compensation.

**Power imbalances**—Corporations have vastly greater resources than
affected individuals or communities to obtain information, hire lawyers,
and influence political processes.

**Limited liability**—Corporate structures shield owners and investors
from full responsibility for harms committed by the corporation,
encouraging risk-taking at others' expense.

**Regulatory capture**—Industries influence or control the agencies
meant to regulate them, ensuring rules favor profit over protection.

## Mainstream Economic Responses

Mainstream economists acknowledge externalities as problems requiring
government intervention. Proposed solutions include:

- **<a href="Taxation" class="wikilink" title="Taxation">Taxation</a>**
  equal to external costs (Pigovian taxes)
- **Regulations** including penalties and standards
- **Legal redress** through tort cases and class action lawsuits
- **Cap-and-trade systems** creating markets for pollution permits
- **Subsidies** for activities with positive externalities

However, these approaches accept the fundamental framework that
generates externalities. They attempt to correct market prices without
questioning why markets systematically misprice goods in the first place
or whether market allocation serves human and ecological wellbeing.

### Critique of Market Solutions

Several problems plague attempts to internalize externalities through
market mechanisms:

**Information asymmetry**—Corporations have greater ability and
incentive to obtain information about their activities and conceal
harmful effects. Regulators and affected parties cannot price
externalities they do not know about.

**Regulatory arbitrage**—Companies move operations to jurisdictions with
weaker regulations, shifting rather than eliminating externalities.

**Incomplete accounting**—Many externalities resist monetary valuation.
How do we price species extinction, community destruction, or
intergenerational harm?

**Power dynamics**—Those who profit from externalities fund political
campaigns, lobby regulators, and shape public discourse, ensuring weak
enforcement and regulatory capture.

**Future generations**—Those most affected by many externalities (future
people, non-human species) have no representation in market or political
processes.

### The Coase Theorem Fantasy

<a href="Libertarian" class="wikilink"
title="Libertarian">Libertarian</a>-style
<a href="anarcho-capitalist" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-capitalist">anarcho-capitalists</a> argue that clearly
defined property rights and low transaction costs would allow private
negotiation to internalize externalities without government
intervention. This Coase theorem approach assumes:

- Property rights can be well-defined
- People act rationally with complete information
- Transaction costs are minimal
- Parties have equal bargaining power

These conditions rarely if ever exist. A logger clear-cutting a forest
that damages a nearby resort might theoretically negotiate compensation,
but a factory poisoning thousands of people cannot practically negotiate
with each affected individual. Information asymmetries, power
imbalances, and transaction costs make such negotiations impossible in
most real-world situations.

Moreover, the Coase approach accepts the premise that all resources
should be privately owned and that environmental harm is acceptable if
properly compensated. This ignores questions of whether certain
activities should occur at all, regardless of price.

## An Anarchist Analysis

From an
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
perspective, externalities reveal capitalism's inherent violence and
unsustainability. The systematic transfer of costs from producers to
communities, workers, and nature is not a bug to be fixed but a feature
required for profit accumulation.

### Beyond Market Failure

Ecological and social economists like Karl William Kapp argue that
"externality" is a misnomer. The modern business enterprise operates on
the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make
profits. What mainstream economics treats as exceptional market failures
are actually capitalism's standard operating procedure.

The concept of externalities assumes the economic system is
fundamentally sound except for minor aberrations. In reality, the
pervasive nature of cost-shifting demonstrates systemic dysfunction.
Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural
problem driving continuous cost-shifting to maximize profit.

### Commodification and Cost-Shifting

<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a>
functions by taking things that are natural and freely available,
claiming exclusive access through
<a href="private_property" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a>, and selling them back to
people. This <a href="commodification" class="wikilink"
title="commodification">commodification</a> process creates artificial
scarcity and enables cost-shifting.

Water provides a clear example. Nature supplies water freely, yet
utility companies charge for access. While they claim to add value
through treatment and delivery, these same companies push for laws
making rainwater collection illegal and oppose community-owned
alternatives. Privatized water systems charge 35% more than public ones
on average while delivering lower quality, extracting profit while
externalizing maintenance and safety costs.

The same pattern appears across industries. Resources taken from commons
or public lands are processed by private companies who capture profits
while shifting environmental and social costs onto the public. This is
not market failure—it is how markets are designed to function under
capitalism.

### Systematic Exploitation

Externalities represent a form of systematic exploitation where:

- Workers suffer health effects from industrial pollution
- Communities bear infrastructure costs for private profit
- Future generations inherit environmental degradation
- Non-human nature is destroyed for immediate gain
- The
  <a href="Global_South" class="wikilink" title="Global South">Global
  South</a> suffers resource extraction and waste dumping to support
  consumption in wealthy nations

This cost-shifting is not incidental but essential to capital
accumulation. Without the ability to externalize costs, many industries
would be unprofitable. The fact that they remain profitable while
causing massive harm demonstrates that markets reward destruction.

## Alternative Approaches

Anarchists propose fundamentally different approaches based on
collective ownership, democratic control, and ecological sustainability:

### Commons Management

Instead of private property that enables cost-shifting, resources can be
managed as
<a href="commons" class="wikilink" title="commons">commons</a>—collectively
owned and democratically governed. Historical and contemporary examples
demonstrate that communities can sustainably manage resources when they:

- Control access and use collectively
- Have long-term stakes in sustainability
- Distribute benefits equitably
- Bear costs directly rather than shifting them

Examples include:

- **Community water systems** like those in Kerala, India, which achieve
  30% lower costs and higher quality through collective ownership
- **Cooperative forests** managed by communities for generations without
  depletion
- **Open-source software** demonstrating how collective production can
  create value without privatization

### Decommodification

Removing essential resources from market logic prevents cost-shifting by
eliminating profit motive from their provision. When communities
directly provision necessities, they bear the full costs and benefits of
production decisions.

Examples include:

- **Uruguay** constitutionalized the right to water, banned
  privatization, achieved universal access, and reduced costs by 40%
- **Luxembourg** made public transport free nationwide, reducing car
  usage by 70% and improving air quality
- **Participatory budgeting** in cities worldwide gives communities
  direct control over resource allocation

### Bioregional Production

Organizing production at bioregional scales makes externalities visible
and unavoidable. When production and consumption occur in the same
community, those who benefit from production directly experience any
negative effects, creating incentives for sustainable practices.

This approach contrasts with globalized supply chains that physically
separate production's harms (often in the
<a href="Global_South" class="wikilink" title="Global South">Global
South</a>) from consumption's benefits (concentrated in wealthy
nations), making externalities invisible to consumers and enabling
continued destruction.

### Sufficiency and Need

In <a href="anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist communism">anarchist communism</a> or similar
arrangements, production is organized around actual needs rather than
profit-driven accumulation. This eliminates the incentive to
overproduce, shift costs, or create artificial demand that drives
resource depletion and waste.

When communities produce what they need rather than what generates
maximum profit, the very concept of externalities becomes
irrelevant—costs and benefits remain internalized within the same
community making decisions.

## Conclusion

Externalities are not market failures requiring technical fixes. They
are capitalism's standard operating procedure, essential to profit
accumulation. The systematic shifting of costs onto workers,
communities, future generations, and the natural world enables private
profit while causing widespread harm.

Market-based solutions cannot address externalities because markets
created and require them. Only by fundamentally reorganizing how we
produce, distribute, and consume—moving toward commons management,
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
and democratic control—can we eliminate the structural drivers of
cost-shifting.

The true cost of capitalism is not reflected in market prices but in
destroyed ecosystems, poisoned communities, degraded health, fractured
societies, and an increasingly uninhabitable planet. These costs are
real even when hidden, and they compound over time. Recognizing
externalities as intrinsic to rather than aberrant within capitalism
points toward the necessity of systemic transformation rather than
regulatory reform.
