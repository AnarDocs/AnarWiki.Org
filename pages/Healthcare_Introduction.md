# How Would Healthcare Work In An Anarchist World?

## The Problem

Healthcare under capitalism operates as a commodity to be bought and
sold rather than a human right, creating fundamental barriers to care.
The profit motive drives pharmaceutical companies to charge exorbitant
prices for life-saving medications, while insurance companies deny
coverage to maximise shareholder returns. This system creates artificial
scarcity where hospitals remain understaffed to cut costs, patients face
financial ruin from medical bills, and preventive care is neglected
because treating illness is more profitable than maintaining health.
Rigid hierarchies within medical institutions prioritise administrative
efficiency over patient needs, while healthcare workers burn out under
impossible workloads designed to extract maximum profit from human
suffering. The result is a two-tier system where quality of care depends
on ability to pay, turning doctors into gatekeepers of a rationed
resource rather than healers focused on community wellbeing.

## The Solution

Anarchist healthcare eliminates the profit motive entirely, organizing
care around human need rather than financial gain. Communities would
control their own healthcare systems through democratic assemblies,
ensuring resources flow to prevention, mental health support, and
addressing social determinants of illness like housing and nutrition.
Healthcare workers would operate as equals in non-hierarchical teams,
making decisions based on medical expertise and patient input rather
than administrative dictates or insurance requirements. With medications
produced through open-source research and manufacturing cooperatives,
treatments would be freely available to all who need them. This approach
recognises that health is fundamentally collective, that caring for each
community member strengthens the whole, replacing the competitive
individualism of capitalism with mutual aid, solidarity, and the
understanding that everyone deserves dignified care simply by virtue of
being human.

### Examples

**Seeing a Doctor for a Simple Problem:** Maria notices a persistent
cough and visits her neighbourhood health centre, a converted community
building run by a collective of healthcare workers. She's greeted by
Ahmed, a community health coordinator who helps her understand her
options. Dr. Chen, who lives in the area and was chosen by the community
assembly, examines her without rushing, as there are no profit targets
or appointment quotas. After diagnosing a minor respiratory infection,
Dr. Chen explains the treatment options and Maria decides on treatments
from the community pharmacy collective, supplemented by rest. The visit
costs nothing, and Maria offers to help with the centre's garden project
next week as her contribution to community care. Dr. Chen notes her case
in the shared community health records to track any local patterns, and
Maria receives follow-up support from neighbourhood health volunteers.

**Urgent Medical Care:** When David collapses at work with chest pain,
his coworkers immediately contact the local emergency collective. Rosa,
a paramedic trained by the community, arrives within minutes in a
well-equipped vehicle maintained by the local transport cooperative. She
stabilises David and takes him to the regional medical centre, where Dr.
Okafor and a surgical team—all community-employed and working
collaboratively rather than hierarchically—perform emergency heart
surgery. The medical team makes decisions through rapid consensus, with
each specialist contributing their expertise as equals. David's
aftercare is coordinated by his neighbourhood health team, who arrange
home visits, rehabilitation, and community support for his family. The
entire process is driven by care needs rather than insurance paperwork
or profit considerations.

**Training to Be a Doctor:** Zara's journey to become a doctor begins
with community recognition of her aptitude and interest during her
formative education years. Rather than competing for limited medical
school places, she joins a medical learning collective where experienced
practitioners teach through mentorship and hands-on experience. Her
training combines theoretical study with immediate community service,
she spends time with traditional midwives, and community health workers
as equals rather than hierarchy. The curriculum is developed
democratically by students, practicing doctors, and community members
based on local health needs. Zara learns not just medical techniques but
also conflict resolution, consensus decision-making, and community
organising. Her "graduation" isn't marked by a certificate but by
community recognition of her competence, and she continues learning
throughout her practice through peer networks and regular community
feedback on her care.

### Regulation

**Medication Regulation:** The regional federation of healthcare
collectives maintains a distributed network of pharmaceutical assessment
teams, each comprising pharmacologists, chemists, community
representatives, and practicing clinicians. When a new medication is
developed—either by researcher collectives or through open-source
pharmaceutical networks—it undergoes parallel testing across multiple
autonomous labs that share data transparently. Safety and efficacy
decisions emerge through consensus among these federated assessment
teams, with no single authority having final say. Manufacturing
standards are maintained through mutual inspection networks where
production collectives audit each other's facilities, sharing findings
openly. Communities can choose to adopt or reject medications based on
federated recommendations, but information flows freely between regions.
Quality control happens through batch testing by independent lab
collectives, with results published in real-time on community networks.
This creates accountability through transparency rather than top-down
enforcement. Manufacturers who consistently produce poor quality
medications find themselves excluded from the cooperative network as
communities choose not to work with them.

**Ensuring Doctor Expertise:** Medical competency is verified through
peer networks and community accountability rather than centralised
licensing. Practicing doctors form assessment collectives that
continuously evaluate each other's work through case reviews,
collaborative consultations, and skill demonstrations. New practitioners
undergo extended mentorships with multiple experienced doctors, with
their progression evaluated by the entire medical collective plus
community feedback. Specialisation happens through apprenticeships with
specialist teams, again evaluated by peers and patients. Doctors
maintain competency through mandatory participation in peer learning
networks, case conferences, and skill-sharing sessions. If concerns
arise about a doctor's practice, peer collectives investigate
collaboratively, offering additional training, mentorship, or—in serious
cases—recommending that communities stop working with that practitioner.
This creates natural accountability: doctors whose competence is
consistently questioned by both peers and patients find themselves
unable to practice, while excellent practitioners are sought after by
communities. The system emphasises collective responsibility for
maintaining standards rather than individual credentials, ensuring
expertise through ongoing peer validation and community trust.

### Production Of Medicines

Under an anarchist healthcare system, insulin would be produced through
federated pharmaceutical cooperatives using open-source research and
manufacturing processes, eliminating the artificial scarcity created by
patent monopolies. Production facilities would be owned and operated by
networks of communities rather than profit-driven corporations, with
manufacturing decisions made democratically based on actual need rather
than market demand. Quality control would be maintained through mutual
inspection between cooperative facilities and transparent sharing of
production data, while distribution networks would operate on mutual aid
principles, and communities with surplus insulin would freely share with
those experiencing shortages. Research into improved insulin
formulations would be conducted collaboratively by scientist collectives
sharing all findings openly, accelerating innovation without the secrecy
and competition that currently slows medical progress. Diabetics would
receive insulin as a matter of course through their community health
centres, with no rationing based on ability to pay and no bureaucratic
barriers, the only consideration being medical need, ensuring that this
life-sustaining medication flows to everyone who requires it as
naturally as communities provide clean water or food assistance.
