# Anarchism in Australia

<a href="Australia" class="wikilink" title="Australia">Australia</a> is
a continental island nation in the Pacific Ocean, originally inhabited
by <a href="Aboriginal_Australians" class="wikilink"
title="Aboriginal Australians">Aboriginal Australians</a> for over
65,000 years before British colonisation began in 1788. The colonial
process involved systematic dispossession of indigenous peoples and the

<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and

million people, with major cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
Perth, and Adelaide. The country operates as a

and <a href="intellectual" class="wikilink"

a significant current throughout the history and literature of the
colonies and nation.

Anarchism's influence has been industrial and cultural, though its
influence has waned from its high point in the early 20th century where
anarchist techniques and ideas deeply influenced the official

## History

### Beginnings

The Melbourne Anarchist Club was officially founded on 1 May 1886 by
<a href="David_Andrade_(anarchist)" class="wikilink"
title="David Andrade">David Andrade</a> and others breaking away from
the Australasian
<a href="Secular" class="wikilink" title="Secular">Secular</a>
Association of Joseph Symes, the journal *Honesty* being the anarchist
club's official organ; and
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
became a significant minor current on the Australian left. The current
included a diversity of views on economics, ranging from an
<a href="individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualism">individualism</a> influenced by
<a href="Benjamin_Tucker" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> to the
<a href="anarchist_communism" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist communism">anarchist communism</a> of
<a href="John_Arthur_Andrews" class="wikilink" title="JA Andrews">JA
Andrews</a>. All regarded themselves as broadly "socialist"
however.[^1][^2]

The Anarchists mixed with the seminal literary figures
<a href="Henry_Lawson" class="wikilink" title="Henry Lawson">Henry
Lawson</a> and
<a href="Mary_Gilmore" class="wikilink" title="Mary Gilmore">Mary
Gilmore</a> and the labour journalist and utopian socialist
<a href="William_Lane" class="wikilink" title="William Lane">William
Lane</a>. The most dramatic event associated with this early Australian
anarchism was perhaps the bombing of the "non-union" ship SS *Aramac* on
27 July 1893 by Australian anarchist and union organiser Larrie
Petrie.[^3] This incident occurred in the highly charged atmosphere
following the defeat of the
<a href="1890_Australian_maritime_dispute" class="wikilink"
title="1890 Australian maritime dispute">1890 Australian maritime
dispute</a> and the
<a href="1891_Australian_shearers&#39;_strike" class="wikilink"
title="1891 Australian shearers&#39; strike">1891 Australian shearers'
strike</a>, an atmosphere which also produced the Sydney-based direct
action group the "Active Service Brigade".[^4]

A major challenge to the principles of these early Australian anarchists
was the virulent <a href="anti-Chinese" class="wikilink"
title="anti-Chinese">anti-Chinese</a>
<a href="racism" class="wikilink" title="racism">racism</a> of the time,
of which racism William Lane himself was a leading exponent. On a
political level the anarchists opposed the anti-Chinese agitation. "The
Chinese, like ourselves, are the victims of
<a href="monopoly" class="wikilink" title="monopoly">monopoly</a> and
exploitation" editorialised *Honesty* "We had far better set to and make
our own position better instead of, like a parcel of blind babies,
trying to make theirs worse."[^5] The anarchists were sometimes more
ambivalent on the subject than this statement of principle might
suggest; anti-Chinese racism was entrenched in the labour movement of
which they were a part, and challenged by few others.[^6]

### World War I

<a href="Monty_Miller" class="wikilink" title="Monty Miller">Monty
Miller</a>, a veteran of the <a href="Eureka_Stockade" class="wikilink"
title="Eureka uprising">Eureka uprising</a>, belonged to the Melbourne
Anarchist Club. He would later become a well-known militant of the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World#Australia" class="wikilink"
title="Australian branch">Australian branch</a> of the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) and was arrested and imprisoned in 1916. His friend the
social activist and literary figure
<a href="Willem_Siebenhaar" class="wikilink"
title="Willem Siebenhaar">Willem Siebenhaar</a> was among those who
campaigned for his release.[^7]

The anarchist tradition was kept alive in Australia by, among others,
the prominent agitator and street speaker
<a href="Chummy_Fleming" class="wikilink" title="Chummy Fleming">Chummy
Fleming</a> who died in Melbourne in 1950 and by Italian Anarchists
active in Melbourne's Matteotti Club and the North Queensland
canefields.[^8] William Andrade (1863–1939),
<a href="David_Andrade_(anarchist)" class="wikilink"
title="David Andrade">David Andrade</a>'s brother and fellow anarchist,
became a successful bookseller in Sydney and Melbourne and while he
retired from active politics in about 1920 he continued to influence
events by allowing various radical groups to use his premises throughout
the 1920s and 1930s.[^9]

### Post-World War II

After World War Two the <a href="Sydney_Push" class="wikilink"
title="Sydney Libertarians">Sydney Libertarians</a> developed a distinct
brand of "pessimistic" or "permanent protest" anarchism, deeply
<a href="sceptical" class="wikilink" title="sceptical">sceptical</a> of
revolution and of any grand scheme of human betterment, yet friendly to
the revolutionary unionism of the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="IWW">IWW</a>. Poet
<a href="Harry_Hooton" class="wikilink" title="Harry Hooton">Harry
Hooton</a> associated with this group, and his friend
<a href="Germaine_Greer" class="wikilink"
title="Germaine Greer">Germaine Greer</a> belonged to it in her youth.
By 1972 she was calling herself an
"<a href="anarchist_communist" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist communist">anarchist communist</a>"[^10] and was still
identifying herself as "basically" an anarchist in 1999.[^11] The Sydney
Libertarians were the political tendency around which the
"<a href="Sydney_Push" class="wikilink" title="Sydney Push">Sydney
Push</a>" social milieu developed, a milieu which included many
anarchists.[^12]

The Sydney Libertarians, along with the remnant of the Australian IWW
and of Italian and Spanish migrant anarchism fed into the Anarchist
revival of the sixties and seventies which Australia shared with much of
the developed world. Another post-war influence that fed into modern
Australian anarchism was the arrival of anarchist refugees from
Bulgaria.[^13]

The last years of Australian involvement in the Vietnam war was an
active period for Australian anarchists, the high-profile draft resister
<a href="Michael_Matteson" class="wikilink"
title="Michael Matteson">Michael Matteson</a> in particular became
something of a folk hero. The prolific anarchist poet
<a href="Pi_O" class="wikilink" title="Pi O">Pi O</a> began to write.
The Brisbane Self-Management Group was formed in 1971,[^14] heavily
influenced by the councillist writings of the
<a href="Socialisme_ou_Barbarie" class="wikilink"
title="Socialisme ou Barbarie">Socialisme ou Barbarie</a> group and its
offshoots. The Anarchist Bookshop in Adelaide began publishing the
monthly *Black Growth*. Anarchists active in inner-city Melbourne played
a major part in creating the Fitzroy Legal Service (FLS) in 1972.[^15]

In 1974 after successfully campaigning against the
<a href="1971_South_Africa_rugby_union_tour_of_Australia"
class="wikilink"
title="1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia">1971 South
Africa rugby union tour of Australia</a>
<a href="Anti-Apartheid_Movement" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-apartheid movement">Anti-apartheid movement</a> activist
<a href="Peter_McGregor" class="wikilink" title="Peter McGregor">Peter
McGregor</a> was one of several people who involved themselves in
resurrecting the Sydney Anarchist Group to organise an Australian
Anarchist conference in Sydney in January 1975. At the time anarchist
theory was being intensely debated.[^16] A diverse Federation of
Australian Anarchists (FAA) was formed at a conference in Sydney in
1975. A walkout from the second conference in Melbourne in 1976 led to
the founding of the Libertarian Socialist Federation (LSF), which in
1977 led to the founding of
<a href="Jura_Books" class="wikilink" title="Jura Books">Jura Books</a>
in Sydney.[^17]

The end of the 1970s saw the development of a
<a href="Christian_anarchist" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchist">Christian anarchist</a>
<a href="Catholic_Worker" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Worker">Catholic Worker</a> tendency in
<a href="Brisbane" class="wikilink" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, the
most prominent person in the group being
<a href="Ciaron_O&#39;Reilly" class="wikilink"
title="Ciaron O&#39;Reilly">Ciaron O'Reilly</a>. This tendency exploded
into prominence in 1982 because of its part along with other anarchists
and assorted radicals in the Brisbane
<a href="free_speech" class="wikilink" title="free speech">free
speech</a> fights during the Queensland premiership of
<a href="Joh_Bjelke-Petersen" class="wikilink"
title="Joh Bjelke-Petersen">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>.[^18]

The Melbourne Anarchist Club celebrated its centennial in 1986 with a
march of around 400 people that culminated in
<a href="Bourke_Street_Mall" class="wikilink"
title="Bourke Street Mall">Bourke Street Mall</a> with speakers.[^19]

The Australian section of the <a href="IWA–AIT" class="wikilink"
title="International Workers&#39; Association">International Workers'
Association</a> (IWA), called the Anarcho-Syndicalist Federation (ASF),
was active among Melbourne's public transport workers, influencing the
1990 Melbourne tram dispute.[^20]

On January 19 2025, following a successful public forum the previous
day, the Melbourne Anarchist Communist Group, Anarchist Communists
Meanjin, and Geelong Anarchist Communists agreed to reconstitute
themselves as branches of the Anarchist Communist Federation. On May 1
of the same year the Anarchist Communist Federation was officially
launched.[^21]
