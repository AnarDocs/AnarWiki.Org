The Hopi are an Indigenous, agricultural people in present-day "Arizona"
with a tradition of egalitarian power-sharing, gender equality and
usufruct. In 1960, there were about 3,500 Hopis, about 300 per
village.[^1] The Hopi belong to the Pueblo peoples of the southwestern
US, and in 1680, the Hopi participated in the Pueblo revolt that
successfully drove Spanish colonizers out of Pueblo territory for twelve
years. In 1934, the US government imposed on the Hopi a hierarchical
governance structure. As of 2017, Peabody Coal's strip mining continues
to threaten the land and communities of the Hopi and their Diné
neighbors.[^2]

The anthropologist Harold Barclay claims, "Hopi of Arizona express an
anarchist distrust of leaders, such that that each individual seeks to
avoid the leadership role, blending into the group as much as
possible."[^3]

# Culture

According to Hopi legend, the Spider Grandmother oversaw humankind's
emergence from three previous realms into the current world. The Spider
Grandmother gave humans two rules to humans: "Don't go around hurting
each other" and "Try to understand things."[^4]

In summarizing Hopi culture, the Hopi Foundation asserts that
gift-giving comprises the "very cornerstone of Hopi society," since it
creates a social and spiritual bond between the giver and recipient. The
Foundation explains that Hopi ethics prize "peace and goodwill,
spiritual knowledge, adherence to religious practices, and
responsibility as Earth stewards." The culture also assigns great value
to "family cohesion, stability and generosity, humility and respect, a
work ethic of self-reliance, and valuing and honoring the needs of the
entire community.""[^5]

Murray Bookchin writes, "The traditional society of the Hopi was geared
entirely toward group solidarity. Nearly all the basic tasks of the
community, from planting to food preparation, were done cooperatively.
Together with the adults, children participated in most of these tasks.
At every age level, the individual was charged with a sense of
responsibility for the community. So all-pervasive were these group
attitudes that Hopi children, placed in schools administered by whites,
could be persuaded only with the greatest difficulty to keep score in
competitive games."[^6]

Alice Schlegel writes the Hopi have a "gender ideology ...of female
superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual
equality."[^7] Traditionally, clans were matrilineal, and land-use
rights were passed down from mother to daughter.[^8] Marriage was
monogamous, and divorce was frequent and easy.[^9] The father's role in
the traditional Hopi family "is something like that of an older comrade
and teacher." He taught his sons to farm and herd sheep, and although
the son respected his father, "he does not ordinarily fear him".[^10]
The mother taught her daughters to grind corn, raise children, and
construct and repair baskets, pottery and houses.[^11]

The wife's family honors the husband's role by frequently visiting the
husband's relatives. However, the husband doesn't have permanent sexual
rights and a woman can unilaterally establish a divorce by simply
leaving his personal belongings outside the door. The divorced man goes
to live with his mother or oldest sister.[^12]

# Decisions

Traditionally, tribal administrators known as *wimmomngwit* included a
village chief, a crier chief, clan leaders and ceremonial leaders.
According to Maria Danuta Glowacka, the wimmomngwi "did not have any
legislative or administrative control or positions, nor did they have
political power within the community. The concept of political power as
an institution referring to domination exercised by some individuals and
groups over others is alien to the traditional Hopi culture. The Hopis
never had centralized political or ceremonial structure. Traditionally,
each village was autonomous and determined its social and ceremonial
organization according to its own interpretation of clan migration
traditions."[^13] Households confederated into clans, clans into
phatries, phatries into villages and villages into Mesas. There are
thirteen villages and three Mesas.[^14] Wayne Davis, an anthropologist,
writes, "The native system of \[Hopi\] government is, in effect, a
practical form of anarchy." [^15]

In 1934, the US held a referendum among the Hopi to decide whether to
organize a federally-recognized tribal government. The vast majority of
Hopi strongly opposed forming a new government, and 90 percent of
eligible voters boycotted the referendum. The referendum passed, and
Hopi governance quickly became much more hierarchical. [^16]

# Economy

Traditionally, the Hopi practiced a usufruct system of land-use.[^17]
Peter Spotswood Dillard describes it as "a form of anarcho-communism".
The 1890 Dawes Act imposed private land ownership on the Hopi economy,
giving each Hopi family 100 acres. Dillard writes that the Hopi clans
"continue to oversee collective ownership of tribal lands".[^18]

# Environment

Traditional Hopi culture assigns great importance to living at a balance
with their land, and there was no notion of dominating nonhuman nature.
As a way of protecting wildlife, Hopi hunters would let the first animal
they saw escape and would only kill subsequent animals. This practice
would prevent over-hunting of threatened species.[^19]

According to Jude Todd, "The Hopi have an acute awareness of humankind's
interrelationship with the rest of nature, including not only plants and
animals, but also such seemingly inanimate entities as stones and
faraway planets and stars....Control, mastery, dominance of nature is
foreign to the Hopi ethos. It can be said that they work with and within
nature, but not in any way that sets them apart from or in opposition to
it, as the notion of control must." The Hopi name their clans after
nonhuman entities like the sun, corn, bears and spiders. Traditional
rituals line up with the seasons and other natural phenomena like rain.
For example, the *Snake Dance* aims to balance the forces of nature so
that rain comes.[^20]

Anthropologist Dorothy Lee describes: “The Hopi Talayesua, describing
his work on the land, does not see himself in opposition to it. He works
with the elements, not against them. He helps the corn to grow; he
cooperates with the thunderstorm and the pollen and the sun. He is in
harmony with the elements, not in conflict; and he does not set out to
conquer an opponent.”[^21]

After the 1934 Hopi government reorganization, the new government became
dominated by assimilated members of society, who frequently were Mormon
converts. The tribal government agreed to lease much of their land for
mining coal, oil and methane gas. Strip mining of coal has required the
mass dispossession of Diné (Navajo) sheep herders living on land the US
government considers property of the Hopi.[^22] Some Hopi, particularly
traditionally-minded members, strongly oppose strip mining. In 1971, six
Hopi elders wrote in a statement supporting a lawsuit against the
strip-mining Peabody Coal Company, "The area we call 'Tukunavi' \[which
includes Black Mesa\] is part of the heart of our Mother Earth...The
land is sacred and if the land is abused, the sacredness of Hopi life
will disappear and all other life as well".[^23] In 1979, the
traditional Hopi leaders David Monongye and Thomas Banyacya attended and
supported the American Indian Movement's Fifth International Treaty
Council summit protesting the displacement of Diné herders due to strip
mining.[^24]

# Crime

"Violence is rare among the Hopi," wrote anthropologist Fred Eggan in
1960. Although the War Chief of the village traditionally had
responsibility for keeping the peace, he had "no punitive powers."[^25]

As a way of deescalating conflict, Hopi perform a clown skit that mocks
the parties involved. Peter Gelderloos elaborates:

> Factions still exist within Hopi villages, but they overcome conflict
> through cooperation in rituals, and they use shame and leveling
> mechanisms with people who are boastful or domineering. When disputes
> get out of hand, they use ritual clown skits at <em>kachina</em>
> dances to mock the people involved. The Hopi offer an example of a
> society that gave up feuding and developed rituals to cultivate a more
> peaceful disposition.[^26] The image of clowns and dances being used
> to solve disputes gives a tantalizing glimpse of humor and art as
> means for responding to common problems. There is a world of
> possibilities more interesting than general assemblies or mediation
> processes! Artistic conflict resolution encourages new ways of looking
> at problems, and subverts the possibility of permanent mediators or
> meeting facilitators gaining power by monopolizing the role of
> arbiter.[^27]

# Revolution

The Hopi participated in the 1680 decentralized Pueblo revolt that drove
Spanish colonizers out of Pueblo territory until 1692. The Tewa Pueblo
medicine man Popé had spent five years building alliances across the
Pueblo towns that had never before united in warfare. By 1680, his
vision of a pan-Pueblo confederation materialized, as Indians blamed
devastating drought and disease on the brutal Spanish colonizers' ban on
indigenous religious rituals. The alliance united some seventeen
thousand Pubelos who resided in over twenty-four towns and spoke at
least six languages. Lacking--or perhaps forgoing--the militaristic
discipline of the Spanish, Pueblo warriors organized a decentralized
resistance, coordinated by messengers running from town to town with
strings of knots representing the number of days until the revolt.
Rising up in August, the Pueblo militants captured Santa Fe and cut off
settlers' water supply. After nine days, the Spanish retreated
southward, “\[b\]ewildered by the scale and success of the
uprising.”[^28]

When Popé took power, however, he erred by establishing centralized
authority over the formerly autonomous Pueblo towns. The historian
Robert Silverberg calls this centralization “the most alien concept
\[the Spanish\] had brought”.[^29] As the Pueblo governor, Popé moved
into the Spanish governor's former palace. He enslaved Pueblos who had
refused to join his rebellion, and he enslaved Pueblos who disobeyed
him. Popé banned Christian rituals with a fervor rivalling the
Spaniards' persecution of indigenous rituals. As drought and disease
persisted, the Pueblo population quickly grew disenchanted with the new
regime. “To some it seemed that things had been under the Spaniards,”
Silverberg writes.[^30] One of those Pueblos was named Juan. A
twenty-eight year-old, he provided a confession of sorts to Spanish
priests in 1681. He complained that Popé banned Christianity, and he
said that many Pueblos felt the Spanish “must come and gain the kingdom”
of New Mexico.[^31]

When the Spanish finally did reconquer the territory in 1692, they
encountered very little resistance. As a ruler, Popé had destroyed the
fragile confederation he had previously helped establish among the
Pueblos.

# Neighboring Societies

Valuing peace, the Hopi "have taken up arms only in exceptional cases,
in order to defend themselves. In their own words, they 'would rather
die of hunger than in war.'"[^32]
