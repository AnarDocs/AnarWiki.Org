The **Wendat** (sometimes known as Huron) are a confederacy of Iroquoian
peoples who united on the land of *Ouendake*[^1] around the Great Lakes
of Turtle Island (North America). By 1400 CE, the Attignawantans,
Attigneenongnahacs, and Arendarhonons belonged to the confederacy, and
the Tahontaenrats and Ataronchronons joined around 1500 CE.[^2] The
nation inhabited the area between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay,
historically known as Wendake. Delegates from the Wendat peoples
reestablished the Wendat Confederacy in 1999, signed with their mothers'
blood by the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma, Wyandot Nation of Kansas, the
Wyandot of Anderdon Nation, and the Huron Wendat of Wendake.[^3]

The traditional Wendat social structure is egalitarian and arguably
matriarchal. In 1644, Father Lallemant wrote of the Wendat:

> "I do not believe that there is any people on earth freer than they,
> and less able to allow the subjection of their wills to any power
> whatever - so much so that Fathers here have no control over their
> children, or Captains over their subjects, or the Laws of the country
> over any of them, except in so far as each is pleased to submit to
> them."[^4]

Seventeenth-century French diplomat Louis Armand de Lom d'Acre Baron de
Lahontan used the word "anarchy" to describe Wendat society. He recalled
that a Wendat explained to him, "We are born free and united brothers,
each as much a great lord as the other, while you are all the slaves of
one sole man. I am the master of my body. I dispose of myself, I do what
I wish, I am the first and the last of my Nation...subject only to the
great spirit."[^5]

## Organisation

### Matrilineal Clan System

The Wendat society used a matrilineal clan system with eight clans named
after animals: Turtle, Wolf, Bear, Beaver, Deer, Hawk, Porcupine, and
Snake. Status, property, and clan membership were inherited through the
women's line. Each person in a clan, regardless of their nation or
village, was considered related, requiring people to marry outside their
clan.[^6]

### Council Structure

The Wendat had a multi-level governance system based on village, tribe,
and confederacy. At the village level, several chiefs represented
different clans, with varying status (civil or war chief). Most chiefs
inherited their status, though they could also gain it through merit or
appointment by elder women of the lineage. Chiefs organized council
meetings to discuss village issues, with both men and women welcome to
give opinions. The Wendat Confederacy met once annually.[^7]

## Culture

### Family and Housing

The Wendat had a matrilineal and matrilocal society, in which the
husband moved in to live with his wife's family. According to
anthropologist Jennifer Birch, "Men's roles did not eclipse women's
power in the community."[^8]

Each town had five or six families, and each family lived in a longhouse
run by a council of its women. These longhouses were rectangular
structures with rounded roofs covered by bark panels, built to serve
extended families. The women controlled the longhouse's clothing, tools,
and food.[^9]

### Spirituality

When Lahontan told the Wendat spokesperson Kandiaronk that the Wendat
lacked religion, Kandiaronk corrected him:

> "First, don't you think we are aware of a creative power in the
> universe, styled the 'Great Spirit,' or the 'Master of Life,' an
> unbounded spirit that we believe to be in everything? Second, we avow
> the immortality of spirits. Third, the 'Great Spirit' endowed us with
> minds as capable of telling good from bad as up from down, so that we
> can, and with precision, figure out sounds rules of justice and
> wisdom. Fourth, spiritual tranquility pleases the great 'Master of
> Life," while, on the other hand, spiritual turmoil horrifies it, since
> trouble twists the human spirit. Fifth, life is a dream, and death, an
> awakening, after which the spirit sees and knows the nature and
> quality of everything, visible or invisible. Sixth, our human
> consciousness cannot stretch more than an inch above everyday
> concerns. We should not stroke our egos by prying into the mysteries
> of unseen and improbable things."[^10]

## Decisions

Women's councils made decisions at the local level, with no male
counterpart. Decisions at the higher levels had a greater gender
balance. Men comprised the decision-making councils, but female councils
had the power to veto the men's decisions.[^11]

Although the all-male decision-making councils may give the impression
of patriarchal authority, the Anarchist writer Elisée Reclus explains
that the relations were more balanced and, if anything, favorable to the
women. "Among the Wyandots of North America, the nation's grand council
consisted of 44 women and 4 men, who were really only the executive
agents of the female will."[^12]

## Economy

There was no private property or class stratification.[^13]

About 70% of the area where the Wendat nation lived was agricultural
land. Most Wendat were farmers, and their economy was based on
horticulture by growing maize, beans and squash using the Three Sisters
polyculture system. Despite living near the northern limit of where
agriculture was feasible and having less fertile soils than regions to
the south and west, they produced agricultural surpluses for trading
with nearby non-agricultural peoples.[^14]

Because the Wendat and other Native Americans did not plow their land,
their soils retained more organic matter and produced higher yields of
maize than early Euro-American farms in North America.[^15]

## Crime

Father Lallemant in the seventeenth century was horrified that the
Wendat did not punish criminals. However, he noted that the Wendat
system of criminal justice was effective. Graeber and Wengrow summarize,
"Rather than punish culprits, the Wendat insisted the culprit's entire
lineage or clan pay compensation. This made it everyone's responsibility
to keep their kindred under control."[^16]
