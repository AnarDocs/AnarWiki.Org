Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy</a>:

> Several million people in India have been traditionally classed as
> 'tribal' . This means they belong to those minority ethnic communities
> which neither observe the caste system nor accept the ideology or
> ritual of Hinduism. They are egalitarian and ordinarily organised into
> exogamous patrilineal clans. Tribal people are found scattered
> throughout India living as village agriculturalists. Their egalitarian
> ideology and decentralised social system in some cases suggests an
> anarchic order.
>
> The Santals, at least, have only the barest indication of any
> governmental system. Numbering over 3,000,000 they live in eastern
> India, largely in the state of Bihar. In the Santai village life is
> ordered by one's own kin group (his family and clan) and by the
> village council and headman. Headmanship is an hereditary position,
> normally passing from father to son, but nevertheless requiring the
> approval of the village's household heads. It is an office for life. A
> headman is seen as the main protector and repository of tradition,
> which is greatly treasured by Santai. He may be referred to as the
> 'big man', in other words, a man of considerable influence. He is also
> seen as a man of wisdom and learning. Nevertheless, he is at best a
> first among equals. "Publicly he is little more than the voice of
> consensus, though privately his influence is that of an especially
> respected and powerful man" (Orans, 21). The headman receives certain
> tributes and privileges for his role, including rent free lands, a
> portion of each animal slain on a communal hunt and a central place at
> all weddings. There are six other offices in a village and these are
> by appointment and for life. These include village priests and an
> assistant responsible for public morals.
>
> The council comprises all household heads in the village. It assembles
> regularly and under the chairmanship of the headman. While he
> ordinarily calls meetings, anyone in the village can make a request
> that one be held. Apparently, in Santai tradition there is strong
> emphasis upon open and free meetings which guarantee every member the
> right to express his views fully. The aim of any meeting should be to
> achieve consensus, but if this unanimity is not forthcoming, the
> support of the overwhelming majority is accepted. Usually final
> decisions follow the recommendations of the headsman.
>
> According to Somers, Santai village life is so structured that it
> prevents concentrations of power. Thus, the seven village office
> holders are never able to constitute a special power clique because
> council meetings are held frequently and are open and free. Santai
> also do not take kindly to the secrecy which would be required for a
> clique to operate. The village has different foci of power such that
> they counterbalance the power of the headman. While each
> institutionalised social segment has authority over its members, there
> is nevertheless considerable tolerance for individual autonomy. It
> seems that Santai have a healthy distrust for power and have therefore
> not only developed techniques to minimise its concentration, but have
> been diligent in preserving and enforcing them.
>
> Local village affairs are the responsibility of the council and
> headman. Conflicts between persons of two different villages
> necessitate settlement through the offices of elders of the village
> involved. A group of between ten to 20 villages constitutes a
> territorial confederation and this is the largest unit of political
> integration in Santai society. This confederation also has a council
> composed of elders and headmen from member villages. There is no
> formalised technique for selection of members. One of the members,
> usually a headman of a village, is elected permanent chairman of the
> group. This assembly is a 'court of last resort' and is concerned with
> intervillage affairs. Here also no decisions are made unless consensus
> of an overwhelming majority has been achieved.
>
> In their adjudications village councils seem primarily to assess fines
> and order ritual purification as judgements. The aim is to restore
> peace rather than to punish. Fines are often used to provide a feast
> and drink for the council and in one area both complainant and accused
> contribute to such a feast, although the accused gives more.
>
> Apparently for certain offences one could be administered physical
> punishment (cf. Culshaw) . This clearly suggests legal sanctions.
> Physical punishment and fines are, however, only imposed by the
> collective meeting of household heads and are arrived at mostly by
> consensus so that such sanctions are in fact more in the nature of
> diffuse sanctions. They are not those enjoined by the force of a
> select elite.
>
> The most awesome punishment which could be imposed on an individual or
> group is ostracism, which is, of course, one form of diffuse
> sanctions. This seems largely to be imposed by the council of the
> confederation and in connection with infractions of marital
> regulations. A person or a group declared ostracised is first
> lampooned by the whole community. Then the guilty will be shunned and
> treated as if non-existent. The sentence of ostracism may be permanent
> or temporary. In the latter, return to the community may depend on the
> person's willingness to change his ways, his demonstrated repentence
> and payment of the costs of purification ceremonies.
>
> Members of Santai society are concerned about concentrations of power
> and the need to preserve an egalitarian society which gives some free
> rein to individual expression. There is at the same time a strong
> dedication to tradition; religious sanctions are both powerful and
> important. With the emphasis upon consensus of the total community,
> diffuse sanctions rather than legal sanctions seem to prevail and
> thus, at the least, Santal society exemplifies a condition of marginal
> anarchy. Yet, with the imposition of British colonial rule and, more
> definitely, with the creation of the Indian republic, Santai society
> has been radically modified and more clearly integrated into and
> subjugated to the national state. For example, confederational
> councils have apparently not acted among the Santai since 1947 and
> local headmen are now responsible to authorities of the central
> government.
