# The SCUM Manifesto

## Overview

SCUM Manifesto is a self-published manifesto by American radical
feminist Valerie Solanas. Published in 1967, it argues that men have
ruined the world, and that it is up to women to fix it. To achieve this
goal, it suggests the formation of SCUM, an organization dedicated to
overthrowing society and eliminating the male sex. The SCUM Manifesto
has been described as a satire or parody, especially due to its
parallels with Freud's theory of femininity.

The term SCUM appeared on the cover of the first edition from Olympia
Press, as "S.C.U.M." and was said to stand for "Society for Cutting Up
Men". Solanas objected, insisting that it was not an acronym, although
the expanded term appeared in a Village Voice ad she had written in
1967.

The SCUM Manifesto was little-known until Solanas attempted to murder
Andy Warhol in 1968. This event brought significant public attention to
the SCUM Manifesto and Solanas herself.

## Summary

The SCUM Manifesto proposes a radical societal overhaul led by
"civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking females". The core objective
of these women, collectively referred to as SCUM, is to "overthrow the
government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation
and destroy the male sex". The manifesto argues that the male is a
"biological accident" and an "incomplete X (female) gene," effectively
an "incomplete female" or "walking abortion". This inherent deficiency
renders males "emotionally limited", "completely egocentric," "incapable
of empathizing or identifying with others, or love, friendship,
affection of tenderness". According to the text, men are responsible for
societal ills such as war, money, marriage, traditional work, the
prevention of an automated society, fatherhood, the suppression of
individuality, and the lack of true community.

SCUM intends to achieve its goals through aggressive and systematic
disruption, rather than conventional activism, operating on a "criminal
as opposed to a civil disobedience basis". Proposed actions include
withdrawing from the labour force to "paralyze the entire nation,"
refusing to obey laws, looting, selectively destroying property, and
murdering men. The manifesto envisions a future completely automated
society where women have "complete control of this country" within
weeks, and all non-creative jobs are automated. In this envisioned
world, men, stripped of their power, would either serve women, "exist
out their puny days dropped out on drugs or strutting around in drag,"
or attend "friendly suicide center\[s\]". The ultimate aim is the
cessation of male production, and eventually, the cessation of all human
reproduction, after aging and death are eliminated.

## SCUM As Anarchism

If we set aside the misanthropic aspects of the SCUM Manifesto, several
of its core tenets and demands align with concepts often found within
anarchist thought. The manifesto calls for the radical dismantling of
existing societal structures and institutions that are typically opposed
by anarchists.

Here are the key points from the sources that support this view:

**Abolition of Government and Money System**: The manifesto explicitly
states that a goal for "civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking
females" is "to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system,
\[and\] institute complete automation". It asserts that there is "no
human reason for money or for anyone to work more than two or three
hours a week at the very most". The "total elimination of the money-work
system" is presented as the means to liberate women from male control.

**Rejection of Authority and Laws**: The text argues there is "no reason
why a society consisting of rational beings capable of empathizing with
each other... should have a government, laws or leaders". It describes
men as having created authorities and government due to their "need for
external guidance and control". SCUM, the group Solanas proposes, is
"against the entire system, the very idea of law and government".

**Critique of Societal Structures**: The manifesto critiques many
structures common to modern society:

**Work and Money**: It suggests that "all non-creative jobs (practically
all jobs now being done) could have been automated long ago". It details
male reasons for maintaining the money system, such as craving female
companionship, a delusion of usefulness, power and control, a love
substitute, and providing a goal.

**The Family Unit**: It argues that society is "not a community, but
merely a collection of isolated family units". The family, particularly
the "male-female couple and their kids," is seen as "unscrupulously
violating the females' rights, privacy and sanity".

**Traditional Community**: The manifesto states that a "true community
consists of individuals... respecting each others individuality and
privacy, at the same time interacting with each other mentally and
emotionally" and co-operating for common ends, contrasting this with
traditional family structures or "hippy" communes.

### Methods of Dismantling the System

SCUM's proposed methods, while violent and destructive, are aimed at
completely disrupting and collapsing the existing order, rather than
working within it. This includes:

- Withdrawing from the labour force to "paralyze the entire nation".

<!-- -->

- Refusing to obey laws, looting, and declaring themselves "off the
  money system".

<!-- -->

- Systematically "fucking up the system, selectively destroying
  property, and murder". This includes actions like salesgirls not
  charging for merchandise, telephone operators not charging for calls,
  and destroying equipment.

<!-- -->

- Taking over public services and media.

<!-- -->

- Operating on a "criminal as opposed to a civil disobedience basis" to
  "destroy the system, not attain certain rights within it".

### Critiques

While many anarchist philosophies would reject the extreme violence,
sexism, and proposed female domination outlined in the SCUM Manifesto,
its fundamental objective to dismantle all existing forms of government,
economic systems, and hierarchical societal norms without replacing them
with a new state (though female control is envisioned) shares
significant common ground with the core anti-statist and anti-capitalist
principles of anarchism. The emphasis on individuality (for women) and a
transformed, non-coercive society (after the male elimination and
automation) also echoes certain anarchist ideals of freedom and
self-determination.
