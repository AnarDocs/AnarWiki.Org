The *hiaitsiihi* or Pirahã people are foragers in the Brazilian Amazon
who live without authorities, gods, and perhaps even ideas of
quantification and time. There's about 800 of them now. They split from
the larger Mura culture an unknown time prior to Spanish colonizers'
encounter in 1714.

A chief value of the hiaitsiihi, according to anthropological linguist
Daniel Everett, is "no coercion; you don't tell other people what to
do...If someone were really violent and disrupted the entire life of the
community, they would be ostracized; they might even be killed. But that
would be a very serious pathological case in the culture. By and large,
they tolerate differences, and even children aren't told what they have
to do that much. Life is hard enough; if children don't do what they
have to do, they'll go hungry"[^1]

Everett says hiaitsiihi culture is further remarkable for (quoted by
Thomas Toivonen in *Green Anarchy*:

> “the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of
> any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence
> of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of
> “relative tenses,” the simplest kinship system yet documented, the
> absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual
> or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence of
> drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures
> documented, and the fact that the Piraha are monolingual after more
> than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the
> Tupi-Guarani-speaking Kawahiv... ultimately derive from a single
> cultural constraint in Piraha, namely, the restriction of
> communication to the immediate experience of the interlocutors.”

Toivonen notes:

> How one would perceive reality without the concept of a fourth
> dimension of time could best be described as ‘in experience’ and ‘out
> of experience’. This explains the Piraha peoples excitement seeing a
> canoe go around a river bend or why they love watching a flickering
> match go out as they go from being ‘in experience’ to ‘out of
> experience’.. Perhaps time is not linear and part of the fundamental
> structure of the universe, not a dimension in which events occur in
> sequence but a constructed dimension. And perhaps it’s possible that
> instead of being an objective thing to be measured, time is actually
> part of a mental measuring system that keeps us from descending into
> total anarchy.

Their use of a hallucigen in monthly rituals is "not exceptional for
them but is widely used by various groups in wet tropical forests of
South America." [^2]

Everett thinks the Pirahã culture disproves Noam Chomsky's idea of a
universal grammar and especially Chomsky's notion that all human
language involves recursion (putting a word or phrase inside another
phrase of the same type (for example putting the noun "machete" inside
the noun phrase "the aardvark's machete"). Chomsky disagrees, referring
to a paper based on Everett's earlier work. Everett replies to that
paper by saying his experience living with the hiaitsiihi taught him to
understand the culture better than he had when conducting his earlier
field research.[^3]
