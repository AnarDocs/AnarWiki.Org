### Notes

- The Cuban government used the hashtag \#HeroesDeAzul (the equivalent
  of Blue Lives Matter) after Black Cuban Hansel E. Hernández was
  murdered by the police
- Search "黑人" on Weibo (a Chinese social media site) and
  Chinese-language Twitter and there’ll be numerous anti-Black comments,
  showing how widespread Chinese anti-Blackness is
- Chinese state media defending Peter Liang, a Chinese American cop who
  shot an unarmed Black person in New York City
- While people praise Cuba for taking in Assata, they forget to mention
  how they turned over Lorenzo Ervin to the police
