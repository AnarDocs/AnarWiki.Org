# Consensus Decision-Making

**Consensus decision-making** is a non-hierarchical process through
which groups attempt to reach decisions that all members can accept,
rather than relying on majority voting. The process has become
widespread in anarchist organizing, social movements, and activist
networks since the 1970s, though its use and merits remain contested
within anarchist theory and practice.

## Origins

While consensus-like practices can be traced to various indigenous
communities and historical societies, the contemporary consensus model
emerged primarily from the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), who
developed formalized consensus processes as early as the 17th
century.[^1]

The modern adoption of consensus by anarchist and activist movements
occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, emerging particularly from feminist
organizing and the anti-nuclear movement. These movements sought
decision-making methods that reflected principles of equality,
non-hierarchy, and full participation.[^2]

The process gained significant visibility during major mobilizations
including the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, subsequent anti-globalization
demonstrations, and the Occupy movement of 2011. By the early 21st
century, consensus had become the predominant decision-making form at
many protest camps, autonomous spaces, and anarchist gatherings.

## Basic Process

### Core Principles

Consensus decision-making rests on several foundational principles:

- All participants have equal voice in decisions affecting them
- Decisions should incorporate everyone's needs and concerns
- The goal is finding solutions acceptable to all, not compromising to
  satisfy a majority
- The process values the reasoning behind decisions as much as the
  decisions themselves
- Dissenting voices deserve serious consideration rather than being
  overruled

### Standard Procedure

A typical consensus process follows this general pattern:[^3]

The group establishes an agenda of items requiring discussion. For each
item, someone provides background information so all participants
understand the issue. Participants then share information and ask
clarifying questions. The group articulates what they hope to
accomplish - defining success and establishing goals. After sufficient
discussion, someone formulates a proposal attempting to synthesize the
various perspectives into a concrete course of action.

The proposal is then tested. Participants can ask clarifying questions,
raise concerns, or suggest friendly amendments (minor modifications). If
significant concerns emerge, the proposal may be withdrawn and
discussion continues. When the proposal appears ready, the group moves
to consensus.

### Decision Points

Rather than voting yes or no, participants typically indicate their
position through hand signals or verbal declarations:[^4]

**Consensus/Agreement**: Full support for the proposal

**Stand Aside**: Personal disagreement but willingness to let the group
proceed

**Block**: Fundamental objection that prevents the proposal from moving
forward

A block represents more than mere disagreement - it signals that the
proposal would cause serious harm to the group or violates its core
principles. Because a single block can halt a decision, this power
carries significant responsibility and is meant to be used sparingly.

### Facilitation

Most consensus processes employ facilitators to help guide discussion,
though approaches vary. The facilitator's role typically includes:[^5]

- Maintaining focus on the current agenda item
- Ensuring all voices are heard
- Synthesizing different viewpoints
- Suggesting when the group is ready to move forward
- Conducting the consensus check

Some groups rotate facilitators regularly to prevent the emergence of
informal hierarchies. Others prefer experienced facilitators who can
manage difficult discussions more effectively. Anti-authoritarian groups
often emphasize that facilitators hold no decision-making power
themselves - they merely assist the process.

### Supporting Roles

Beyond facilitation, consensus meetings often assign additional roles:

- **Note taker**: Records decisions and key discussion points
- **Timekeeper**: Tracks time limits for agenda items
- **Vibes watcher**: Monitors group dynamics, emotional climate, and
  power imbalances
- **Stack taker**: Maintains a speaking order when multiple people wish
  to contribute

## Positive Applications

### Small Group Organizing

Consensus advocates argue the process works particularly well in small,
cohesive groups where participants know and trust each other. In
affinity groups of 5-15 people working together regularly, consensus can
foster deep collaboration and shared ownership of decisions.[^6]

The Spanish anarchist movement's use of affinity groups (*grupos de
afinidad*) demonstrates this application. These small cells of trusted
comrades made tactical decisions through informal consensus, allowing
rapid response while maintaining horizontal principles.

### Prefigurative Politics

Consensus appeals to those who see revolutionary organizing as
prefiguring the future society. If anarchists seek a world without
domination and coercion, the argument goes, their organizing methods
should embody these values now.[^7]

Peter Gelderloos articulates this perspective: "Making the shift to the
consensus decision-making process might be the most important thing that
we can do to build a democratic society. Consensus creates true
democracy—not the democracy in name only that sickens any aware
person."[^8]

### Respecting Dissent

The block mechanism allows minorities to prevent decisions they find
fundamentally harmful. This can protect against tyranny of the majority
and ensure marginalized voices receive serious consideration rather than
being routinely outvoted.

In groups dealing with complex power dynamics - including those around
gender, race, or experience - consensus can theoretically create space
for less confident voices to express concerns that might otherwise be
silenced.

### Building Unity

Proponents argue that consensus, when it works, produces stronger
commitment to decisions than majority voting. When everyone must agree,
the resulting synthesis can incorporate diverse viewpoints and create
buy-in from all participants. People feel heard rather than defeated,
reducing resentment and increasing follow-through on collective
decisions.[^9]

### Avoiding False Dichotomies

The consensus process encourages creative problem-solving rather than
simply choosing between pre-existing options. The synthesis required to
reach consensus can generate innovative solutions that none of the
original proposals contained.

## Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its theoretical appeal, consensus has faced substantial
criticism from anarchist practitioners and theorists.

### Tyranny of the Minority

A fundamental critique holds that consensus enables small minorities, or
even individuals, to obstruct the will of the majority. Luther Blissett
describes attending a No Borders Camp where a few travelers with dogs
blocked a decision supported by over 90% of attendees, leading to a
lowest-common-denominator outcome that ignored majority
preferences.[^10]

This dynamic contradicts anarchist opposition to domination. When a
minority can prevent collective action supported by the vast majority,
Blissett argues, this constitutes a form of minority rule rather than
true horizontality.[^11]

### Informal Hierarchies

Critics observe that consensus meetings often develop informal power
structures that formal process cannot eliminate. Confident, articulate
participants - disproportionately men in mixed-gender groups - tend to
dominate discussions. Those comfortable in the group environment, who
know the facilitator and other key participants, wield greater influence
than newcomers or less assertive members.[^12]

The feminist Jo Freeman's critique "The Tyranny of Structurelessness"
addresses this dynamic. Freeman argued that claiming to have no
structure merely disguises hierarchy rather than eliminating it. Without
formal accountability mechanisms, informal elites emerge who are harder
to challenge than official leaders would be.[^13]

In consensus meetings, this manifests as a core group of frequent
participants who shape discussions, know each other and the facilitator,
and can more easily get their preferences adopted. Meanwhile, those less
integrated into the group may feel pressured not to block proposals or
raise substantive objections.

### False Consensus

The moral pressure to "not hold up" the group creates incentives for
people to stand aside rather than voicing genuine concerns. The result
is often false consensus - superficial agreement hiding suppressed
dissent.[^14]

Blissett notes: "There is a strong moral pressure put on dissenting
parties to stop 'holding up' proceedings and preventing 'consensus'.
Thus a uniformity of false 'consensus' arises."[^15]

### Scaling Problems

Consensus becomes exponentially more difficult as group size increases.
What may work for a dozen people becomes unwieldy with hundreds. Large
meetings drag on for hours with circular discussions, exhausting
participants and excluding those without time for marathon
sessions.[^16]

Historical workers' movements typically used majority voting in large
assemblies, general strikes, and factory occupations. From the Russian
soviets to Spanish collectives to Argentine workplace occupations,
voting rather than consensus has been the norm when workers
self-organize on a large scale.[^17]

Ralf Burnicki, discussing anarchist consensus democracy, acknowledges
this limitation: "A consensual democracy cannot function with a
population of millions." He proposes that decentralized organization
into manageable communities is essential for any consensus-based society
to function.[^18]

### Time and Efficiency

Consensus processes often consume enormous time on relatively minor
decisions. This can lead to activist burnout and reduce the actual work
groups accomplish. For time-sensitive situations - responding to police
repression, coordinating strike actions, addressing emergencies - the
drawn-out nature of consensus can prove debilitating.

### Recuperation and Manipulation

Critics point out that consensus procedures can be more easily
manipulated by bad-faith actors than voting systems. Reformist forces,
infiltrators, or those pushing party lines can more easily water down
militant positions through appeals to unity and finding "common ground"
than they could through trying to win majority votes.[^19]

At anti-summit mobilizations, this has manifested in liberal and
reformist groups using consensus to dilute militant direct action into
symbolic protest acceptable to authorities.

### Cultural Specificity

The contemporary consensus model emerged from specific cultural
contexts - primarily white, middle-class, college-educated activist
scenes in the Global North. Its communication norms, time requirements,
and assumptions about participation may not translate well across
cultural boundaries or to working-class organizing.[^20]

Many working-class and immigrant communities have different traditions
of collective decision-making that may be equally horizontal but look
nothing like the standard activist consensus model.

## Historical Anarchist Practice

Examining historical anarchist organizations reveals a more complex
picture than contemporary consensus advocacy might suggest.

### The First International

When the anarchist movement emerged within the International
Workingmen's Association in the 1860s-1870s, anarchists routinely used
majority voting at congresses and local meetings while maintaining
federalist and anti-authoritarian principles.[^21]

At the 1869 Basel Congress, anarchists including Mikhail Bakunin, James
Guillaume, and Adhémar Schwitzguébel participated in majority voting on
resolutions without objecting to the practice itself. Local meetings of
International sections typically adopted resolutions "unanimously bar
two votes" or "bar three votes" - showing a preference for broad
agreement but willingness to proceed without absolute consensus.[^22]

### Anti-Authoritarian International

The 1872 St. Imier Congress, often considered the founding moment of the
organized anarchist movement, established explicit procedures for
collective decision-making. The congress statutes specified:

"Except for matters of administration, there will be no recourse to
voting; questions of principle cannot be subject to a vote. General
Congress decisions are mandatory only for those Federations that accept
them. Voting at a General Congress will be by Federation, each Regional
Federation having one vote."[^23]

This combined majority voting for practical matters with the principle
that groups could not be forced to accept positions they rejected - a
federalist approach distinct from either pure consensus or simple
majoritarianism.

### Spanish Anarcho-Syndicalism

The CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo), the largest anarchist
organization in history, consistently used majority voting in assemblies
and congresses. The organization's structure, as described by José
Peirats:

"At all times, the basis for any local, regional, or national decision
is the general assembly of the union, where every member has the right
to attend, raise and discuss issues, and vote on proposals. Resolutions
are adopted by majority vote attenuated by proportional
representation."[^24]

The CNT's 1919 congress, attended by over 400 delegates representing
nearly 700,000 workers, adopted resolutions through majority voting,
with recorded tallies sometimes showing hundreds of thousands voting for
or against specific proposals.[^25]

### Diversity of Practice

Some historical anarchists did advocate unanimity. Peter Kropotkin
shifted from supporting majority voting in the 1870s to advocating
unanimous agreement by the 1890s, drawing on Russian peasant commune
traditions. He argued that elected authorities and majority rule in
intentional communities led to their failure, while unanimous folkmoot
decisions promoted cohesion.[^26]

Ricardo Mella, writing in 1899, proposed a society "without voting"
where associations would form and dissolve based on agreement, and where
experimentation would resolve practical disputes. However, even Mella
conceded that occasionally groups would have to defer to majority
opinion as a last resort when other methods failed.[^27]

This historical diversity suggests that anarchists have never had a
single, unified position on decision-making procedures. The contemporary
dominance of consensus is a relatively recent development, not an
eternal anarchist principle.

## Synthesis: When and How to Use Consensus

Rather than treating consensus as universally superior or fundamentally
flawed, many contemporary anarchists advocate a nuanced,
context-dependent approach.

### Appropriate Contexts

Consensus appears to work best when:

- Groups are small (roughly under 20 people)
- Participants know and trust each other
- Sufficient time is available for thorough discussion
- The decision is not time-critical
- The issue requires genuine synthesis rather than choosing between
  incompatible options
- Cultural and communication norms are shared
- Power differentials are relatively minimal or actively addressed[^28]

### When Alternatives May Be Better

Majority voting or other procedures may be preferable when:

- Large numbers of people are involved
- Quick decisions are necessary
- Options are genuinely incompatible (can't synthesize "dogs allowed"
  and "no dogs allowed")
- Bad-faith actors are attempting to manipulate the process
- Time constraints prevent exhaustive discussion
- The group is diverse in background and unfamiliar with each other[^29]

### Hybrid Approaches

Some groups combine elements of consensus and voting:

- Using consensus for major strategic decisions but voting for routine
  matters
- Requiring supermajority votes (two-thirds, three-quarters) rather than
  absolute consensus
- Allowing individuals to stand aside but not to block entirely
- Using consensus for small group decisions but federation-level voting
  for coordination between groups[^30]

### Improving Consensus Practice

For groups committed to consensus, several practices can mitigate common
problems:

- Actively working to dismantle informal hierarchies and power dynamics
- Providing clear training in the process for all participants
- Setting time limits for discussions
- Breaking into smaller groups for complex issues
- Regular rotation of facilitation and other roles
- Explicit discussion of when blocking is appropriate
- Creating multiple spaces for decision-making rather than funneling
  everything through one large meeting
- Willingness to acknowledge when consensus isn't working and try
  alternative approaches[^31]

## Theoretical Considerations

### Consensus and Anarchist Principles

The relationship between consensus and anarchist theory remains
contested. Proponents argue that consensus embodies key anarchist
values:

- Rejection of domination and rule over others
- Equal empowerment of all participants
- Prefiguring horizontal social relations
- Valuing process as well as outcomes

Critics counter that anarchism opposes authority and hierarchy, not
collective decision-making through voting. They point out that
historical anarchists consistently used majority voting while
maintaining thoroughly anti-authoritarian politics. The equation of
voting with hierarchy, they argue, rests on conceptual confusion.[^32]

As Errico Malatesta distinguished: "The vote that anarchists reject,
that they must reject unless they contradict themselves, is the vote by
which they renounce their own sovereignty, the vote that gives the
majority the right to impose their will upon the minority, the vote that
is used to make and justify the law. But the vote used to record
opinions certainly has nothing anti-anarchist about it."[^33]

### Freedom of Association

Both consensus advocates and critics generally agree that anarchist
organizing must respect freedom of association. No one should be coerced
into groups or forced to implement decisions they find abhorrent.

The disagreement centers on what this means in practice. Consensus
advocates argue it means no decision without everyone's agreement.
Critics argue it means anyone dissatisfied with a decision can leave and
form new associations, but minorities shouldn't be able to prevent
majority action within voluntary associations.

### Different Spheres, Different Methods

Some anarchists propose that decision-making methods should vary by
context:

- Small affinity groups: Informal consensus among trusted comrades
- Mass organizations: Majority voting in assemblies
- Federations: Delegates with limited mandates; decisions binding only
  on groups that accept them
- Communities: Mix of individual autonomy, household decisions,
  neighborhood assemblies, and regional coordination[^34]

This pluralistic approach recognizes that no single decision-making form
suits all situations.

## Contemporary Debates

Consensus decision-making remains a live controversy in contemporary
anarchist movements, with passionate advocates and critics.

Those defending consensus often emphasize its role in creating space for
marginalized voices, building solidarity through patient discussion, and
embodying anti-authoritarian values. They may acknowledge practical
problems but view them as issues of implementation rather than
fundamental flaws.

Critics argue that romanticizing consensus has hindered effective
organizing, enabled manipulation by reformist forces, and created
activist cultures that exclude working-class participation. They
advocate recovering the voting traditions of historical anarchist
movements.

These debates often reflect deeper questions about anarchist organizing:
Should we prioritize prefiguration or effectiveness? How do we balance
individual autonomy with collective action? What practices can genuinely
transcend rather than merely disguising hierarchy?

No definitive resolution appears forthcoming. Different anarchist
milieus continue experimenting with various approaches, learning from
both successes and failures.

## Alternatives and Complements

Several related decision-making approaches exist:

**Modified Consensus**: Requiring supermajority (e.g. 75% or 90%) rather
than unanimity, balancing broad agreement with ability to decide

**Consensus Minus One**: Allowing one or two blocks but proceeding if
broader agreement exists

**Sociocracy**: Consent-based decision-making focused on whether
proposals cause objections rather than seeking active agreement

**Majority Voting with Minority Rights**: Using votes but protecting
dissenting minorities through federalist structures, recall, and freedom
to disassociate

**Sortition and Rotation**: Randomly selecting decision-makers and
rotating positions to prevent elite formation

**Delegation**: Electing recallable delegates with limited mandates to
coordinate between groups

Different anarchist groups and campaigns have experimented with these
and other forms, recognizing that no perfect system exists.
