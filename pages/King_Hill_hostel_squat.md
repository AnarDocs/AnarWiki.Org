In 1965, families squatted at King Hill Hostel, an ex-army camp in Kent,
England. A significant solidarity campaign developed, carrying out the
decisions made by the tenants of the squat. The government accepted the
squat, and the campaign sparked a squatting movement throughout
Britain.[^1]

From "The Squatting Campaign: homes for families" by Jim Radford[^2]:

> In 1965 I became involved in a seminal campaign at King Hill Hostel in
> Kent. It was an ex-army camp out in the wilds; big wooden huts, very
> poor facilities. They put the women in the hostel but the husbands
> were turned away and told: "We don't cater for men, we can't have
> you." Children over 16 were also excluded. So the families were
> dispersed. And then after three months the women and the small
> children were evicted, which meant in most cases - in Kent, for
> example, where we researched it - most of the families broke up and
> never got back together again. There were even suicides. This had been
> going on for years, and hundreds and hundreds of families had been
> destroyed.
>
> In 1965 there was a spontaneous revolt. One of the husbands moved in
> to the hostel to be with his wife and his children, and refused to
> leave. The local authority took him to court and he was sent to jail.
> So a group of us went down there and got the people in the hostel
> together. We created an organisation called the Friends of King Hill.
> We contacted all the women's husbands - some were sleeping in cars -
> and we moved them in en masse, barricaded the hostel, and fought a
> long and bitter campaign for 12 months.
>
> King Hill Hostel served the whole of Kent at that time, including
> Bromley, which was not yet part of Greater London. We were saying:
> "Why are you sending people out to this remote place, out in the
> wilds, a mile walk to the nearest village? Why don't you accommodate
> them where there's work and where they can be in contact with their
> families?" They said: "We haven't got the places." So we said: "Yes
> you have. We've researched it - you've got all these empty houses."
>
> Publicity was our most potent weapon. We had tremendous coverage, the
> bulk of which was supportive. We invaded the House of Commons, we
> camped outside the minister of health's house. Every week we were
> thinking up new things to do. And the result? Not only did we get Kent
> county council to change its policy to accept the whole family and to
> scrap the three months limit but we also compelled the government
> through the force of public opinion to issue two circulars directing
> local authorities throughout the country to do the same. We changed
> the system throughout the country because all local authorities from
> then on were required to accept the whole family and not to
> arbitrarily evict them.
>
> The King Hill campaign triggered campaigns in other places. There were
> hostel campaigns and homeless action groups springing up all over the
> country.
