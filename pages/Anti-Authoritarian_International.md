Revolutionary Anarchism</a>:

> The final collapse of the anarchist wing of the IWMA in 1877 ended the
> first genuinely international attempt to organise the
> socially-conscious working class, although its torch was soon taken up
> by the Anti-Authoritarian International (AAI) or “Black
> International,” founded by the likes of Pyotr Kropotkin in 1881, the
> year of the assassination of Tsar Alexander II by narodniks. Pyotr
> Kropotkin (1842–1921), was a Russian prince, polymath geographer,
> zoologist, economist, and evolutionary theorist who turned his back on
> privilege to become Bakunin’s ideological heir and champion of
> anarchism \[...\] The Black International included the anarcho- and
> revolutionary syndicalists of the CGO and the body that merged with
> it, the Mexican Workers’ Grand Circle (CGOM), representing the
> majority of organised workers in Mexico by 1880, and the Central Labor
> Union (CLU) in Chicago. The Black International, however, later took
> an increasingly purist stance, became dominated by the minority
> anarcho-insurrectionist tendency, and only lasted until about 1893.
