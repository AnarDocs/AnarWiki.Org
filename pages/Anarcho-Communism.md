# Anarcho-Communism

**Anarcho-communism** (also known as **anarchist communism**,
**libertarian communism**, **free communism**, **communist-anarchism**
or **stateless communism**) is a

## History

### Forerunners

The modern current of
"<a   href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a> was
founded by the "<a   href="Neo-Babouvism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Neo-Babouvists">Neo-Babouvists</a> of the journal *L'Humanitaire*
(published in mid-1841), who drew from the "anti-political and anarchist
ideas" of "<a   href="Sylvain_Maréchal.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sylvain Maréchal">Sylvain Maréchal</a> (1750–1803).

The foundations of anarcho-communism were laid by
"<a   href="Théodore_Dézamy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Théodore Dézamy">Théodore Dézamy</a> in his 1843 work *Code de la
Communauté*, which he formulated as a critique of
"<a   href="Étienne_Cabet.md" class="wikilink" title="Étienne Cabet">Étienne
Cabet</a>'s "<a   href="utopian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian socialism">utopian socialism</a>. In his *Code*, Dézamy
advocated the abolition of
"<a   href="money.md" class="wikilink" title="money">money</a>, of the
"<a   href="division_of_labour.md" class="wikilink"
title="division of labour">division of labour</a> and of the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>. He
also championed the introduction of
"<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a> of property and the
distribution of resources ""<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs">from
each according to their ability, to each according to their needs</a>".
In anticipation of anarchist communism, Dézamy rejected the need for a
transitional stage between
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and communism, instead calling for immediate
"<a   href="communisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="communisation">communisation</a> through the direct cessation of
"<a   href="commerce.md" class="wikilink" title="commerce">commerce</a>.

Following the "<a   href="French_Revolution_of_1848.md" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution of 1848">French Revolution of 1848</a>,
"<a   href="Joseph_Déjacque.md" class="wikilink"
title="Joseph Déjacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> (1821–1865) formulated a
radical form of communism that opposed both the
"<a   href="revolutionary_republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="revolutionary republic">revolutionary republicanism</a> of
"<a   href="Auguste_Blanqui.md" class="wikilink"
title="Auguste Blanqui">Auguste Blanqui</a> and the
"<a   href="mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">mutualism</a> of
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>. Déjacque
opposed the authoritarian conception of a
""<a   href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the
proletariat</a>" and instead upheld the
"<a   href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a> and
"<a   href="self-organisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-organisation">self-organisation</a> of workers. Opposed not
just to government, but to all forms of
"<a   href="oppression.md" class="wikilink" title="oppression">oppression</a>,
Déjacque advocated for a "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a> to abolish the state,
religion, the
"<a   href="nuclear_family.md" class="wikilink" title="nuclear family">nuclear
family</a>, and private property. In their place, Déjacque upheld a form
of "<a   href="anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchy">anarchy</a> based
on the free distribution of resources.

### Formulation in the International Workingmen's Association

The
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA) was established in 1864. The entry of
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> (1814–1876) into the IWA in
1868 first infused the federalists with a programme of
"<a   href="revolutionary_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="revolutionary socialism">revolutionary socialism</a> and
"<a   href="anti-statism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-statism">anti-statism</a>, which agitated for
"<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a> and
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> against capitalism and the state.

Following the defeat of the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> in 1871, the IWA split over questions of
"<a   href="socialist_economics.md" class="wikilink"
title="socialist economics">socialist economics</a> and the means of
bringing about a "<a   href="classless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="classless society">classless society</a>.
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>,
who favoured the conquest of state power by political parties, banned
the anarchists from the IWA. The anarchist faction around the
"<a   href="Jura_Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="Jura Federation">Jura
Federation</a> resolved to reconstitute as their own
"<a   href="Anarchist_St._Imier_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Authoritarian International">Anti-Authoritarian
International</a>.

As a "<a   href="collectivist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist">collectivist</a>, Bakunin had himself opposed
communism, which he regarded as an inherently
"<a   href="authoritarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian ideology">authoritarian ideology</a>. But with
Bakunin's death in 1876, the anarchists began to shift away from his
theory of collectivism and towards an anarchist communism. The term
"anarchist communism" was first printed in
"<a   href="François_Dumartheray.md" class="wikilink"
title="François Dumartheray">François Dumartheray</a>'s February 1876
pamphlet.

"<a   href="James_Guillaume.md" class="wikilink" title="James Guillaume">James
Guillaume</a>'s August 1876 pamphlet, *Ideas on Social Organisation*,
outlined a proposal by which the
"<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">collective ownership</a> of the
"<a   href="means_of_production.md" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">means of production</a> could be used in
order to transition towards a
"<a   href="communist_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="communist society">communist society</a>. Guillaume considered a
necessary prerequisite for communism would be a general condition of
"<a   href="Post-scarcity_economy.md" class="wikilink"
title="abundance">abundance</a>, which could set the foundation for the
abandonment of "<a   href="exchange_value.md" class="wikilink"
title="exchange value">exchange value</a> and the free distribution of
resources.

In October 1880, a Congress of the defunct International's
"<a   href="Jura_Federation.md" class="wikilink" title="Jura Federation">Jura
Federation</a> adopted
"<a   href="Carlo_Cafiero.md" class="wikilink" title="Carlo Cafiero">Carlo
Cafiero</a>'s programme of *Anarchy and Communism*, which outlined a
clear break with Guillaume's collectivist programme. Cafiero rejected
the use of an exchange value and the collective ownership of industry,
which he believed would lead to
"<a   href="capital_accumulation.md" class="wikilink"
title="capital accumulation">capital accumulation</a> and consequently
to "<a   href="social_stratification.md" class="wikilink"
title="social stratification">social stratification</a>. Instead,
Cafiero called for the abolition of all
"<a   href="wage_labour.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labour">wage
labour</a> and for the distribution of resources ""<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs">from
each according to their ability, to each according to their needs</a>".

### Expansion and Development

Between 1880 and 1890, anarchist communists were opposed not only to
political struggles but also to strikes which put forward wage claims or
were organised by trade unions. This anti-reformist tendency was
accompanied by an anti-organisational tendency, with partisans declaring
themselves in favor of agitation amongst the unemployed for the
expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles.

Even after
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> and others decided to enter
"<a   href="labor_union.md" class="wikilink" title="labor union">labor
unions</a>, anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists remained, such as
"<a   href="Sébastien_Faure.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sébastien Faure">Sébastien Faure</a>'s *Le Libertaire* group and
Russian partisans of "<a   href="economic_terrorism.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic terrorism">economic terrorism</a> and expropriations.

According to the anarchist historian
"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">Max
Nettlau</a>, the first use of the term "libertarian communism" came with
the 1880
"<a   href="List_of_anarchist_congresses#Other_congresses.md" class="wikilink"
title="Le Havre anarchist congress">Le Havre anarchist congress</a>. The
French anarchist journalist "<a   href="Sébastien_Faure.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sébastien Faure">Sébastien Faure</a> started the weekly paper *Le
Libertaire* (*The Libertarian*) in 1895.

### Revolutionary Applications

#### Makhnovshchina

In "<a   href="Ukraine.md" class="wikilink" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the
anarcho-communist guerrilla leader
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a> led an independent anarchist army from 1918 to 1921 during

"<a   href="guerrilla.md" class="wikilink" title="guerrilla">guerrilla</a>
campaign opposing both the Bolshevik "Reds" and monarchist "Whites". The
"<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> organized an
"<a   href="list_of_anarchist_communities.md" class="wikilink"

"<a   href="Bolshevik.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>.

#### Spanish Revolution of 1936

The most extensive application of anarcho-communist ideas happened
during the "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>. In
response to the army rebellion, an
"<a   href="Anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist-inspired">anarchist-inspired</a> movement of peasants
and industrial workers, supported by armed militias, took control of
"<a   href="Barcelona.md" class="wikilink" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and
of large areas of rural Spain, where they
"<a   href="Collective_farming.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivized">collectivized</a> the land.

Much of "<a   href="Spain&#39;s_economy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spain&#39;s economy">Spain's economy</a> was put under worker
control; in
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%. Factories
were run through worker committees, and
"<a   href="Agriculture.md" class="wikilink" title="agrarian">agrarian</a>
areas became collectivized and ran as libertarian
"<a   href="Commune_(intentional_community).md" class="wikilink"
title="communes">communes</a>. Anarchist
"<a   href="Gaston_Leval.md" class="wikilink" title="Gaston Leval">Gaston

directly or indirectly in the Spanish Revolution.

### Historical Examples

## Organisation

Anarcho-communism calls for a
"<a   href="Libertarian_socialist_decentralization.md" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a>
"<a   href="Federalism#In_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="federalist">federalist</a> structure based on relationships of
mutual aid and

title="free association">free association</a> between communes and
"<a   href="workers&#39;_council.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; council">workers' councils</a>, federated into a
broader council system as an alternative to the
"<a   href="centralism.md" class="wikilink" title="centralism">centralism</a>
of the "<a   href="nation-state.md" class="wikilink"
title="nation-state">nation-state</a>.

"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> argued: "Representative government has accomplished its
historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule; and by its
debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to see
in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a
gross error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political
phase; and it is impossible to touch the very basis of the present
economic life—private property—without a corresponding change in the
very basis of the political organization."

## Philosophical Principles

### Motivation

Anarchist communists reject the belief that "wage labor is necessary
because people are selfish by human nature." They point to examples of
humans being willing to sacrifice time or resources for others and
believe that systems of wage labor and state taxation serve more to
restrict that instinct to help others rather than ensuring a society
continues to function.

Many anarchist communists, like
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, believe that the
"<a   href="evolutionary_anthropology.md" class="wikilink"
title="human evolutionary tendency">human evolutionary tendency</a> is
for "<a   href="evolution_of_morality.md" class="wikilink"
title="humans to cooperate for mutual benefit and survival">humans to
cooperate for mutual benefit and survival</a> instead of existing as
lone competitors.

### Property

Anarchist communists call for the abolition of
"<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> while maintaining respect
for "<a   href="personal_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="personal property">personal property</a>. As
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> maintained: "The
revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and
distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal
possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your
own, but the watch factory belongs to the people."[^2]

### Freedom and Work

Anarchist communists support communism as a means for ensuring the
greatest freedom and well-being for everyone, rather than only the
wealthy and powerful.
"<a   href="Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>
advocated for significantly lowering the number of hours each individual
dedicates to necessary labor and ensuring "unlimited freedom of
production and consumption."

"<a   href="Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>
said that the main authoritarian mistakes in communist experiments of
the past were their being based on "religious enthusiasm" and the desire
to live "as a family" where the individual had to "submit to the
dictates of a punctilious morality".[^3] For him, anarcho-communism
should be based on the right of free association and disassociation for
individuals and groups and on significantly lowering the number of hours
each individual dedicates to necessary labor.[^4]

## Criticism

While anarcho-communism has inspired numerous successful experiments in
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
"<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>, and
"<a   href="gift_economy.md" class="wikilink" title="gift economies">gift
economies</a>, critics point to challenges in:

- Coordinating complex industrial production without markets or central
  planning
- Preventing the re-emergence of informal hierarchies
- Managing resource distribution in large-scale societies
- Defending anarchist territories from hostile state actors

Supporters argue these challenges can be addressed through improved
technology, "<a   href="horizontal_organization.md" class="wikilink"
title="horizontal organization">horizontal organization</a>, and the
development of revolutionary consciousness.
