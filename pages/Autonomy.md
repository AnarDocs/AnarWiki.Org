# Autonomy

## Overview

**Autonomy** refers to the capacity for self-determination and
self-governance, both at the individual and collective level. Within
anarchist thought, autonomy represents a fundamental principle
encompassing personal freedom, bodily sovereignty, and the collective
organization of communities without hierarchical control. Unlike liberal
conceptions that reduce autonomy to isolated individualism, anarchist
autonomy recognizes the social nature of freedom - that genuine
self-determination requires both liberation from coercive authority and
the positive construction of cooperative relationships and institutions.

The concept extends beyond simple independence to encompass the ability
of individuals and communities to consciously determine their own lives,
make meaningful choices free from coercion, and participate equally in
collective decision-making. Autonomy in anarchist practice involves the
rejection of all forms of domination - whether by the state, capital,
patriarchy, or other hierarchical structures - while simultaneously
building alternative forms of social organization based on voluntary
association, mutual aid, and direct democracy.

## Historical Development

### Early Workers Movement

The language of autonomy has been integral to movements for proletarian
emancipation since the 19th century. Karl Marx defined the workers
movement in The Communist Manifesto as "the autonomous movement of the
immense majority in the interest of the immense majority."[^1]
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, reflecting on the revolutionary experiences of
1848, argued in *On the Political Capacity of the Working Classes*
(1865) that for any class to act independently it must fulfill three
requirements: consciousness of itself, awareness of "the law of its
existence," and the ability to draw practical conclusions from this
understanding.[^2]

Both thinkers advocated for independent working-class political action.
This emphasis on class autonomy distinguished anarchist and
revolutionary socialist movements from reformist tendencies that sought
to maintain workers' dependence on liberal or social-democratic parties.

### Spanish Workers Autonomy

The concept achieved concrete expression during the Spanish workers
struggles of the 1960s and 1970s. Following the civil war and throughout
the Franco dictatorship, a new workers movement emerged among the
largely rural-to-urban migrant population. Initially operating through
churches and the interstices of Franco's Vertical Trade Union, workers
began organizing autonomous assemblies to address labor issues,
establishing informal networks that became the original Workers
Commissions.

As class consciousness developed, particularly after May 1968, workers
increasingly understood their struggle not merely against individual
bosses but against capital and the authoritarian state itself. The goal
became "self-management" - workers' direct control over the means of
production. However, the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) increasingly
dominated the Commissions, transforming them into reformist trade unions
focused on legalistic practices and negotiation rather than
revolutionary action.

The most advanced sectors of the working class responded by forming more
combative organizations - "circles," "commission platforms," "workers
committees" or "autonomous workers groups" - with the term "autonomous"
emphasizing independence from parties and organizations alien to the
working class. These groups advocated direct democracy, rejecting the
bureaucratic control exercised by Stalinist reformism.

By the early 1970s, workers had lost fear of repression and increasingly
challenged both bosses and the state through direct action - spreading
strikes across industries, forming pickets, and transforming localized
disputes into general strikes. The tactic of forcing bosses to negotiate
with "illegal" assembly delegates represented the conquest of workers'
autonomy from all external representatives, whether state bureaucracy,
opposition parties, or clandestine trade unions.

The assembly movement reached its peak between 1976 and 1978, when
workers began taking their affairs into their own hands. However, the
movement faced defeat as all political parties and trade unions signed
the Moncloa Pact against the assemblies. The 1980 Labor Law legally
condemned autonomous assemblies, and trade union elections created a
class of professional representatives who, with accommodationist
elements within the assemblies, hijacked the leadership of
struggles.[^3]

### Italian Autonomist Movements

The term "autonomy" gained renewed significance through Italian social
movements of the 1970s, though with varying and sometimes contradictory
interpretations. "Autonomia Operaia" (Workers Autonomy) emerged as both
a movement and theoretical tendency, though its legacy remains contested
within anarchist circles.

The movement's most radical elements emphasized workers' independence
from trade unions and political parties, direct action, and the
formation of autonomous zones of resistance. However, certain Leninist
intellectuals attempted to recuperate the movement, transforming genuine
autonomous struggles into ideological products divorced from actual
working-class self-organization.

The authentic autonomous groups of this period - such as those in
Barcelona and elsewhere - operated on the principle that autonomy meant
"not simply a common practice founded upon a minimum shared framework
for action, but also an autonomous theory corresponding to our way of
life, of struggle, and our concrete needs." They rejected permanent
organizational forms like political parties, instead organizing for
concrete tasks and dissolving when those tasks concluded.[^4]

## Forms of Autonomy

### Personal Autonomy

Personal autonomy represents the capacity for self-governance at the
individual level - the ability to consciously determine one's own life
according to one's will while respecting the equal freedom of others.
Philosopher Immanuel Kant refined the concept by distinguishing it from
crude freedom, defining autonomy as "dutiful freedom" - a state of
awareness where individuals bridge the gap between personal desires and
what is ethical for all people.

In Kantian terms, an autonomous person recognizes themselves as part of
humanity as a whole, acting in ways that do not infringe upon others'
capacity for self-determination. This represents true freedom because it
allows people to choose independently while remaining mindful of the
dignity and responsibility they share with all rational beings.[^5]

From an anarchist perspective, personal autonomy cannot exist in
isolation from social conditions. The capacity for meaningful
self-determination requires not only freedom from coercive interference
but also access to resources, education, and social relationships that
enable genuine choice. Autonomy thus understood is both a right and a
practice that must be actively cultivated through struggle against
domination and the construction of liberatory social forms.

Personal autonomy under capitalism and the state remains perpetually
constrained. Individuals depend absolutely on technological systems,
wage labor, and state-sanctioned institutions for survival, creating
dependence that precludes genuine self-determination. The separation of
individuals from the means of subsistence, from each other, and from the
products of their activity represents the negation of autonomy. Freedom
which capitalist society offers rests not on autonomous association but
on atomization and dispossession.[^6]

### Bodily Autonomy

Bodily autonomy encompasses the right to control one's own body, free
from coercion, manipulation, or unauthorized intervention by others.
This includes the right to refuse unwanted physical contact, to make
decisions regarding one's own healthcare and reproductive choices, to
determine one's gender identity and expression, and to be protected from
violence and exploitation.

The concept extends beyond mere "freedom from interference" to encompass
positive capacities - the actual ability to make meaningful choices
about one's body, which requires not just absence of direct coercion but
access to resources, information, and social support. Under conditions
of patriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, and capitalism, bodily autonomy
remains systematically denied to women, queer and trans people, disabled
people, people of color, and workers whose bodies become instruments of
capital accumulation.

Bodily autonomy does not equal "sexual availability." There exist
numerous situations that attenuate consent - intoxication,
unconsciousness, positions of dependency or vulnerability. Having bodily
autonomy means possessing the right to have one's boundaries respected,
particularly in circumstances where one cannot give full, free,
meaningful consent. To act upon someone's body in such circumstances
violates their bodily autonomy precisely because they possess it - if
they had no such autonomy, there would be nothing to violate.

The struggle for bodily autonomy challenges medical authoritarianism,
gender policing, reproductive control, and all systems that treat bodies
as objects to be regulated rather than as belonging to the conscious
subjects who inhabit them. This includes resistance to forced
medication, coercive psychiatry, genital cutting, conversion therapy,
and all other forms of bodily violence enacted through institutional
power.[^7]

### Youth Autonomy

Youth autonomy represents one of the most suppressed dimensions of
autonomist thought and practice. Young people face systematic denial of
bodily autonomy, self-determination, and participation in decisions
affecting their lives. This oppression operates through multiple
institutions - family, school, medicine, law - that treat youth as
property of adults rather than as conscious beings deserving respect.

The denial of autonomy to young people includes lack of control over
their own bodies (including vulnerability to corporal punishment, forced
medical procedures, and denial of healthcare), lack of freedom of
movement and association, exclusion from political participation, and
subjection to arbitrary adult authority. When adults teach children they
are not allowed to say "no" to being touched, grabbed, handled, or
struck by authorized adults, this systematically undermines their
capacity to recognize and resist violations of their bodily autonomy,
including sexual abuse.

Respecting youth autonomy means recognizing young people's right to be
free from bodily coercion, which includes protection from adult sexual
exploitation. Sex with a child violates the child's bodily autonomy
precisely because the child possesses such autonomy - the right to be
free from bodily coercion.

Youth liberation requires dismantling adult supremacy while building
forms of care and support that respect young people's dignity, needs,
and developing capacities. This means rejecting both authoritarian
control and liberal "rights" discourse that leaves youth isolated and
vulnerable. Instead, youth autonomy develops through practices of
collective care, intergenerational solidarity, and the creation of
spaces where young people can participate meaningfully in decisions
affecting their lives.[^8]

### Relationship Autonomy

Anarchism emphasizes free and voluntary association as the basis for all
social relationships. Relationship autonomy means individuals possess
the freedom to form, maintain, and end associations according to their
own will, without coercion from state, capital, family, or community
pressure. This applies to friendships, sexual and romantic
relationships, living arrangements, and all forms of social connection.

Under current conditions, relationships operate under pervasive
coercion - economic dependence forces people to remain in situations
they would otherwise leave, legal structures like marriage create
state-sanctioned hierarchies, gender norms impose heterosexual nuclear
family arrangements, and social pressure enforces monogamy and other
relationship structures regardless of individual desire.

Relationship autonomy challenges compulsory sexuality, compulsory
monogamy, compulsory heterosexuality, and all other normative
impositions on how people relate to one another. It means respecting
people's choices to be sexual or asexual, monogamous or non-monogamous,
coupled or single, without treating any particular form as inherently
superior or more legitimate.

At the same time, relationship autonomy is not absolute individualism -
anarchist conceptions emphasize mutual aid and collective
responsibility. Autonomy in relationships means both freedom from
coercion and freedom to form meaningful connections based on mutual
care, respect, and solidarity. The goal is not isolation but rather
associations freely chosen and continually renewed through ongoing
consent.[^9]

### Collective Autonomy

Collective autonomy represents the capacity of communities and groups to
govern themselves without external domination. This includes workers'
control over production, neighborhood assemblies making decisions
affecting residents, indigenous communities maintaining sovereignty over
their territories, and all forms of participatory self-management.

Collective autonomy differs fundamentally from both state sovereignty
and corporate control. States claim "autonomy" while exercising coercive
power over populations; corporations operate "independently" while
extracting surplus value from workers. Genuine collective autonomy
requires horizontal organization, direct democracy, and the equal
participation of all affected parties in decision-making.

The practice of collective autonomy involves developing institutions
that enable meaningful participation - assemblies, councils, committees
with revocable delegates, and coordination mechanisms that preserve
local autonomy while enabling broader solidarity. These institutions
must actively work to overcome internalized hierarchies, ensuring that
differences in ability, confidence, experience, or social privilege do
not recreate inequalities within autonomous spaces.

Collective autonomy is not "consensus" in the sense of unanimous
agreement on all questions, but rather the ongoing practice of
negotiating differences through dialogue, respecting dissent, and
ensuring all voices can be heard. It requires patience, commitment to
process, and willingness to move at the speed of trust rather than
sacrificing the most vulnerable for the sake of rapid expansion.[^10]

## Anarchism and Autonomy

### Autonomy as Foundation

Anarchist political philosophy rests fundamentally on the principle of
autonomy. Robert Paul Wolff argues in *In Defense of Anarchism* that
anarchism represents the only political arrangement compatible with
genuine autonomy because only anarchism can sustain both individual and
collective dimensions of freedom without subordinating one to the other.

Democratic republics fail to achieve this because electoral systems
create "tyranny of the majority" - policies affecting everyone are
pushed forward without unanimous agreement, meaning the autonomy of
those who lose in elections is negated. Similarly, regimes embracing
extreme individualism fail to acknowledge collective elements of
freedom, allowing individual or minority will to override the autonomy
of the majority.

The fundamental problem is that modern governments claim authority to
decide for populations while autonomous persons possess an unalienable
capacity for self-determination that cannot be transferred to another.
When a government acts without unanimous consent, even if only one
person dissents, it fails to represent everyone's autonomy - yet a
population is a totality without exceptions. Government authority thus
becomes questionable even when only one person refuses to acquiesce.

Furthermore, governments monopolize legitimate use of violence, vesting
civil servants and police with powers citizens do not possess. Though
violence is never justifiable, this example demonstrates that
governments, composed of citizens, can use autonomy in ways that
outweigh other citizens' autonomy. Anarchism, as a society without
rulers, could eliminate this inequality by refusing to recognize
violence as legitimate for anyone, thereby equalizing the autonomy all
share.[^11]

### Autonomy Versus Authority

The tension between autonomy and authority represents the central
contradiction that anarchism seeks to resolve. Authority - defined as
the right to command and the correlative duty to obey - fundamentally
contradicts the autonomous person's capacity for moral self-legislation.
An individual cannot simultaneously maintain their autonomy and submit
to authority without contradiction.

This distinguishes anarchism from all forms of governmentalism,
including democratic socialism, which seeks to make authority more
accountable or representative without questioning authority itself. For
anarchists, the problem is not who exercises authority or how they are
selected, but the existence of authority as such. Even the most
democratic state remains illegitimate from the standpoint of autonomy
because it requires some to obey decisions made by others.

The anarchist solution is not to eliminate coordination or social
organization but to replace authority with voluntary association.
Decisions affecting everyone should be made through processes where all
participate equally and agreements are honored because they are freely
entered, not because of anyone's right to command. This requires
fundamentally different institutions than those developed under state
forms - institutions based on assembly, federation, and revocable
delegation rather than representation and enforcement.

### Self-Management and Participatory Decision-Making

Anarchist autonomy finds practical expression through self-management
and participatory decision-making processes. Self-management means those
affected by decisions participate directly in making them, rather than
delegating power to representatives or experts. This applies equally to
workplaces, where workers collectively determine production, and to
communities, where residents govern neighborhoods through assemblies.

Participatory decision-making involves actual engagement in determining
outcomes rather than periodic selection of rulers. Assemblies convene to
address concrete issues, decisions emerge through discussion and
consensus-building, and delegates (when necessary for coordination)
remain revocable and mandated rather than granted independent authority.
This stands in contrast to representative systems where populations
surrender decision-making power to elected officials who then govern on
their behalf.

The effectiveness of these practices was demonstrated during
revolutionary periods - the Spanish collectives of 1936-1937, the
assemblies during the 1976-1978 Spanish workers movement, the Zapatista
autonomous municipalities in Chiapas, the democratic confederalism
practiced in Rojava. These examples show that autonomy is not utopian
but eminently practical when people are committed to building it.[^12]

### Autonomy and Economic Justice

Stateless or minimalist economies best match autonomy because they can
balance individual and collective freedom while ensuring everyone's
basic needs are met as a precondition for autonomy. Capitalist free
markets create gross wealth inequality, giving a few enormous power over
many and undermining the autonomy of workers. When the richest hold the
most power and influence legislation affecting everyone, those who
generate wealth through labor have little say in policies they must
follow.

This breeds political inequality - the autonomy of the few outweighs
that of the many. Anarchist economics avoids these problems by leveling
the playing field, enabling all to pursue self-determination with
minimal resistance while being respectfully mindful of others' autonomy.

Conversely, centralized command economies, while potentially equalizing
wealth, deny autonomy by having the state select occupations for
members. Though this might help many individuals, it fails to protect
anyone's autonomy - when everyone must submit to state power, no one
commands their own autonomy. Regardless of economic security, when the
state chooses what is best for anyone, no one freely selects which
occupation will fulfill their desire to contribute to society.

An anarchist economy recognizes everyone's basic rights and securities
with minimal authority to intrude in economic matters. By allowing
people to freely conduct business while protecting them from violence,
exploitation, and coercion, this maintains both individual volition and
collective justice. Since an anarchist or minimalist state best reflects
autonomy, it can transcend the need for an economic state - the liberty
and security of individuals and the collective would not be in
jeopardy.[^13]

## Contemporary Struggles

### Autonomous Movements Today

Contemporary autonomous movements continue developing and adapting
anarchist principles of self-organization. The Zapatista communities in
Chiapas, Mexico, practice autonomy through direct democratic assemblies
at the community level, federated through regional councils. Women
participate equally in decision-making, and indigenous culture is
maintained while being transformed through revolutionary practice.

In Rojava (Northeast Syria), the Kurdish freedom movement has
implemented democratic confederalism - a system of nested councils from
neighborhood to regional level, with particular attention to women's
autonomy through parallel women's councils possessing veto power over
general councils. This represents an attempt to institutionalize
autonomy within a revolutionary process while defending against military
threats.

Autonomous social centers, occupied spaces, and temporary autonomous
zones emerge continuously worldwide, creating spaces for experimentation
with non-hierarchical organization, mutual aid, and collective
decision-making. Though often temporary or marginal, these spaces
provide laboratories for autonomous practice and prefigurative politics.

### Challenges to Autonomy

Several factors currently threaten and constrain autonomy. Digital
technology creates dependence on technological means for communication
and relationship, producing individuals addicted to equipment and
incapable of direct contact. Information and communications technologies
impose conditions for social activity, define rhythms, and demand
permanent adaptation to change. Technology itself conquers autonomy
while creating the illusion of individual autonomy through network
connectivity.

The gig economy and precarious labor undermine economic autonomy, making
survival dependent on constant availability and subjection to
algorithmic management. Accumulation of personal data enables
unprecedented surveillance and control, while behavioral modification
through social media platforms shapes desires and perceptions without
conscious awareness.

State and police violence intensifies against autonomous movements and
spaces, with increased criminalization of protest, direct action, and
alternative ways of living. Legal systems increasingly target
infrastructure - defining pipelines, data cables, and property as more
important than human life and autonomy.

Climate crisis creates conditions of scarcity and emergency that
governments use to justify authoritarian responses, while actual
response requires collective autonomous action at scales that remain
difficult to coordinate. The question of how to respond with
deliberation rather than reproducing urgency-based organizing that
leaves vulnerable people behind remains unresolved.[^14]

### Building Autonomy

Despite these constraints, autonomy can be actively constructed through
concrete defensive actions. Current conditions allow organization of
groups for resistance to specific aggressions of spectacular
capitalism - high-speed rail projects, industrial wind farms,
incinerators, dams, highways, power lines, real estate speculation,
precarious labor, genetically modified organisms.

The strategy involves establishing lines of resistance from which an
environment opposed to capitalism can be reconstructed, enabling
revolutionary consciousness to crystallize again. If the world is not
ready for grand strategies but for guerrilla actions, then autonomous
groups represent the most suitable organizational formula.

This includes developing forms of collective care, mutual aid networks,
community gardens, tool libraries, skill-sharing, and other practices
that meet needs outside market and state. It means creating spaces -
physical and social - where people can experiment with non-hierarchical
relationships and decision-making.

Building autonomy requires patience and commitment to process, moving at
the speed of trust rather than sacrificing people for growth. It means
taking seriously questions of accessibility around disability and
chronic illness, centering the needs of the most vulnerable rather than
assuming they will catch up or can be addressed later.

The goal is not to escape capitalism through personal lifestyle choices
but to collectively build alternative forms of life that can sustain
long-term resistance. This involves both defending against ongoing
attacks and constructing new institutions and relationships that embody
autonomy in practice.[^15]

## Criticism

Various criticisms of autonomy and autonomous organizing have been
raised from different perspectives:

**Scalability concerns**: Critics argue that autonomous organization
cannot scale to address large-scale coordination problems, requiring
either state forms or market mechanisms for complex societies.
Autonomists respond that federation enables coordination while
preserving local autonomy, and that many "large-scale" problems are
actually created by centralized systems.

**Tyranny of structurelessness**: Some feminists argue that refusing
formal structures allows informal hierarchies to dominate, with
charismatic individuals or those with more time and resources exercising
disproportionate influence. Autonomists acknowledge this risk,
emphasizing that horizontal organization requires active attention to
power dynamics and developing structures that enable participation while
preventing domination.

**Urgency and efficiency**: Authoritarian leftists criticize autonomous
movements as too slow and deliberative to address immediate threats,
arguing for vanguard organization and centralized discipline.
Autonomists question whether movements that sacrifice vulnerable members
for speed truly serve liberation, and note that authoritarian strategies
have repeatedly betrayed revolutionary goals.

**Individualism and isolation**: Some critics see autonomy as another
form of liberal individualism that undermines collective solidarity.
Anarchists emphasize that autonomy is inherently social - genuine
self-determination requires cooperative relationships and mutual aid,
not atomized competition.

**Youth liberation opposition**: Mainstream society, including much of
the left, resists extending autonomy to young people, treating any such
advocacy as dangerous. This resistance reveals how naturalized adult
supremacy remains even within movements claiming to oppose hierarchy.
