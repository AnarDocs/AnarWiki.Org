The **Croatan** were an indigenous people in what is now called "North
Carolina" who may have once been a part of the
<a href="Roanoke" class="wikilink" title="Roanoke">Roanoke</a> people.
They lived in current Dare County, an area encompassing the Alligator
River, Croatan Sound, Roanoke Island, Ocracoke Island, and parts of the
Outer Banks, including Hatteras Island.[^1] The word "Croatan" likely
means "council town" or "talk town", indicating the residence of an
important leader and a place where councils were held.[^2]

In the late sixteenth century, one of the very first English colonies in
North America appears to have collectively deserted the English and
lived among the Croatan.

## Governance

Rather than ruling over their people with coercion, Croatan chiefs used
persuasion in order to lead. Chiefs and their families were held in
great status and received respect, but they were not all-powerful. To
pursue a collective goal, chiefs had to convince their followers that
the action would be in the tribe's best interest. The chief was
responsible for spreading wealth to his tribe, and, if unable to do so,
they received less respect, or even lost respect entirely.[^3]

## Beliefs

According to Thomas Harriot, the indigenous people living in coastal
North Carolina believed there was "one only chief and great God, which
has been from all eternity" and which made petty gods "to be used in the
creation and government to follow."[^4]

## European Colonization

The arrival of English settlers upset some pre-existing tribal
relationships. The Algonquian people advocated cooperation, while others
(the Yamasee, Cherokee and Chickasaw, for example) resisted this
approach. Despite varying relationships among tribes, the Roanoke and
Croatan were believed to have been on good terms with English colonists
of the Roanoke Colony. Wanchese, the last leader of the Roanoke,
accompanied the English on a trip to England, although he was
distrustful of the English.[^5] In 1586, Wanchese finally severed his
former good relations with the English, leaving Chief Manteo as the
colonists' sole native ally.[^6]

## The Lost Colony

In 1585, the English established the Roanoke colony in what is now
"North Carolina."[^7] In 1590, an Englishman named John White, who'd
been sent from Roanoke to get supplies from England, returned to the
settlement after three years away. He found the 115 English settlers
missing and his colony long deserted. The buildings had collapsed and
"the houses \[were\] taken down." The only clues he found were the word
"Croatoan" carved into a palisade and the abbreviation "Cro" carved into
a tree.[^8]

Croatoan was the name of a nearby island (likely modern-day Hatteras
Island) in addition to the local tribe. Roanoke Island was not
originally the planned location for the colony and the idea of moving
elsewhere had been discussed. Before the Governor's departure, he and
the colonists had agreed that a message would be carved into a tree if
they had moved and would include an image of a Maltese Cross if the
decision was made by force. White found no such cross and was hopeful
that his family was still alive.[^9]

### Evidence of Assimilation

A leading theory among scholars is that the "Lost Colony's" residents
assimilated into the Croatan nation or with other indigenous
communities.[^10] "Basically, the historical evidence says that's where
they went," explains archeologist Mark Horton.[^11]

In 1709, English explorer John Lawson wrote *A New Voyage to Carolina*,
in which he described the remains of an English fort on Roanoke Island
and conjectured that the "Hatteras Indians" were descended from the
settlers at Roanoke, stating "A farther Confirmation of this we have
from the *Hatteras Indians,* who either then lived on *Ronoak*-Island,
or much frequented it. These tell us, that several of their Ancestors
were white People, and could talk in a Book, as we do; the Truth of
which is confirm'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these
*Indians,* and no others."[^12]

Archeological digs have supported the theory that the Lost Colony joined
the Croatans. According to *National Geographic*, "Artifacts suggest
some members of \[the\] ill-fated English settlement survived and
assimilated with Native Americans."[^13] For example, archeologists
found on Croatan land parts of a sixteenth-century gun and English
pottery typical of the late sixteenth century. Since the first recorded
Englishman did not reach the area until the mid-seventeenth century (in
1655), the gun parts and pottery may have been brought from the "Lost
Colony." Still, the people involved in the dig admit that their findings
do not comprise definitive evidence of English assimilation into the
Croatan. For instance, Indians could have simply found and taken the
objects from European settlements. Martha Williams told *National
Geographic*, "I would love to see some definitive evidence, but what we
have is fragmentary."[^14]

## Modern Legacy

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, various groups
claiming descent from the Croatan emerged, though historians remain
skeptical of direct connections to the Lost Colony. The North Carolina
state legislature recognized the Croatan Indians of Robeson County and
the Croatan Indians of Sampson County in 1911, allowing them separate
schools with teachers of their own choice.[^15] These groups are today
known as state-recognized tribes, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and
the Coharie Intra-tribal Council, Inc., respectively.[^16]
