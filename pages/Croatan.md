The Croatans are an indigenous people in "North Carolina" that may have
once been a part of the Roanoke people. In the late sixteenth century,
one of very the first English colonies in North America appears to have
collectively deserted the English and lived among the Croatan.

Rather than ruling over their people with coercion, Croatan chiefs used
persuasion in order to lead. *Wikipedia* summarizes: "Chiefs and their
families were held in great status and with respect, but they had to
convince followers that action or cause was wise, they did not command.
The role of the chief was to spread wealth to his tribe, otherwise
respect was lost."[^1]

In 1585, the English established the Roanoke colony in what is now
"North Carolina."[^2] In 1590, an Englishman named John White, who'd
been sent from Roanoke to get supplies from England, returned to the
settlement. He found the 115 English settlers missing. The only clues he
found were the word "Croatoan" carved into a post and the abbreviation
"Cro" carved into a tree.[^3]

A leading theory among scholars is that the "Lost Colony's" residents
assimilated into the Croatan nation or with other indigenous
communities.[^4] “Basically, the historical evidence says that’s where
they went,” explains archeologist Mark Horton.[^5]

Archeological digs have supported the theory that the Lost Colony joined
the Croatans. According to *National Geographic*, "Artifacts suggest
some members of \[the\] ill-fated English settlement survived and
assimilated with Native Americans."[^6] For example, archeologists found
on Croatan land parts of a sixteenth-century gun and English pottery
typical of the late sixteenth century. Since the first recorded
Englishman did not reach the area until the mid-seventeenth century (in
1655), the gun parts and pottery may have been brought from the "Lost
Colony." Still, the people involved in the dig admit that their findings
do not comprise definitive evidence of English assimilation into the
Croatan. For instance, Indians could have simply found and taken the
objects from European settlements. Martha Williams told *National
Geographic*, "I would love to see some definitive evidence, but what we
have is fragmentary.”[^7]
