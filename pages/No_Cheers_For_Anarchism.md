# No Cheers For Anarchism

**No Cheers For Anarchism** is a critical article written by
<a href="Sheri_Berman.md" class="wikilink" title="Sheri Berman">Sheri
Berman</a> and published in *Dissent* magazine's Fall 2015 issue as part
of their "Arguments on the Left" special edition.[^1] The article
presents a comprehensive critique of
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> as
an ineffective political strategy, arguing that anarchists are "better
dreamers than doers" and that successful political movements require
"compromise, organization, and yes, even leadership, to actually get
things done."

The article sparked significant debate within anarchist circles and
generated multiple substantive responses from anarchist theorists and
activists.

## Overview

Berman, a professor of political science at
<a href="Barnard_College.md" class="wikilink"
title="Barnard College">Barnard College</a>, argues that while
anarchists may be motivated by worthy aspirations, anarchism represents
an ineffective approach to political change. She characterizes all
variants of anarchism as sharing "a rejection of authority and
hierarchy" and dreams of "a world without states, traditional political
organizations, or any other structures that restrict individual
freedom."[^2]

The article draws parallels between anarchists and
<a href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarians">libertarians</a>, distinguishing them primarily on
their attitudes toward
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a> -
with anarchists viewing it as inherently coercive while libertarians
venerate it as protecting individual rights.

## Historical Critique

### Paris Commune and Early Anarchism

Berman cites the
<a href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> as evidence of anarchism's failure, arguing that its "lack
of internal organization, leadership, or agreed-upon goals left it prone
to infighting and vulnerable to counter-attack."[^3] She also points to
the period of <a href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>, noting that
anarchist assassinations and bombings were "almost uniformly
unsuccessful" and provided conservatives with rationale for repressive
measures against the entire left.

### Interwar Period

The article argues that during the interwar period,
<a href="social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democratic">social democratic</a> parties became "bulwarks
of democracy," while anarchists returned to attacking the democratic
order. Berman specifically criticizes anarchist activity in
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a>,
claiming it "damaged and divided the left, provided fodder to the
anti-democratic right, and helped pave the way for the civil war."[^4]

### Contemporary Movements

Berman dismisses recent anarchist-influenced movements, particularly
<a href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">Occupy Wall Street</a>, as having only
"theatrics and ephemeral impact." She contrasts this with organizations
like the National Rifle Association's "persistent grassroots
organizing," arguing that effective political action requires sustained
institutional engagement rather than public demonstrations.[^5]

## Anarchist Responses

The article generated several significant responses from within the
anarchist movement, each challenging different aspects of Berman's
critique. The responses addressed her three main historical critiques
while offering alternative frameworks for understanding anarchist
effectiveness.

### Responses to the Paris Commune Critique

**Graham's Historical Correction:**
<a href="Robert_Graham.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Graham">Robert
Graham</a> directly challenged Berman's characterization of the Paris
Commune as an anarchist failure, noting the irony of blaming anarchists
when "considering how few actual anarchists were there."[^6] Graham
cited
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>'s analysis that the Commune failed precisely because of
its "centralized and bureaucratic nature," arguing that anarchist
critiques focused on how the Commune "submitted to governmental
fetichism and gave itself a government," which paralyzed popular
initiative by forcing revolutionaries into bureaucratic roles.[^7]

**Alternative Analysis:** Anarchist responses emphasized that the Paris
Commune was dominated by
<a href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxists">Marxists</a> and
<a href="Blanquism.md" class="wikilink" title="Blanquists">Blanquists</a>,
not anarchists. The failure stemmed from hierarchical thinking that
concentrated power in the Hôtel de Ville rather than maintaining direct
democratic control. This represented exactly the kind of statist
approach anarchists opposed, making Berman's critique historically
inaccurate.

### Responses to Interwar Period Claims

**Graham's Defense of Spanish Anarchism:** Graham directly contradicted
Berman's claim that anarchist activity caused the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, arguing that "it was
the election of a social democrat-led coalition, not anarchist agitation
(as Berman alleges), that spurred Franco's coup." He emphasized that
without immediate action by the
<a href="CNT.md" class="wikilink" title="CNT">CNT</a> and
<a href="UGT.md" class="wikilink" title="UGT">UGT</a> trade unions to arm
and mobilize the population, "against a backdrop of paralysis on the
part of the government, Franco's victory likely would have been nearly
instantaneous."[^8]

**Hultner's Historical Context:** Hultner noted that anarcho-communists
from the United States who were deported to the post-revolution Soviet
Union in the 1920s "saw their deportation as an opportunity to help grow
the international communist project, only to be met with
marginalization, and eventually, the Gulag."[^9] This illustrated how
anarchists consistently attempted cooperation with other leftists, only
to face repression.

**Revolutionary Catalonia Example:** Anarchist responses pointed to
<a href="Revolutionary_Catalonia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a> (1936-1939)
as a counter-example to Berman's claims, where
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalists">anarcho-syndicalists</a> successfully
collectivized industry and agriculture, demonstrating effective
anarchist organization during the very period Berman criticized.

### Responses to Contemporary Movement Dismissal

**Sitrin's Global Perspective:**
<a href="Marina_Sitrin.md" class="wikilink" title="Marina Sitrin">Marina
Sitrin</a> directly countered Berman's dismissal of contemporary
movements by documenting successful anarchist-influenced organizing
worldwide. She highlighted how movements like
<a href="PAH.md" class="wikilink" title="PAH">PAH</a> (housing defense in
Spain), Social Solidarity Clinics in Greece, and land defense movements
in Argentina emerged from communities using
<a href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and
<a href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>.[^10] Sitrin emphasized that these movements create power
"horizontally and through self-organization" rather than petitioning
existing institutions.[^11]

**Hultner's Occupy Defense:** Hultner challenged Berman's
characterization of <a href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> as mere "theatrics,"
arguing that "anarchist praxis formed the backbone of Occupy Wall
Street, turning it from yet another march against corporate greed into
lasting occupations and movement incubators." He noted that OWS
"dramatically changed the bounds of mainstream economic and political
debate" and influenced figures like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
Sanders.[^12]

**Contemporary Examples:** Anarchist responses pointed to numerous
successful contemporary applications of anarchist principles:

- The
  <a href="Zapatistas.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatistas">Zapatistas</a>
  in Chiapas maintaining autonomous communities for decades
- <a href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a>'s
  <a href="democratic_confederalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="democratic confederalism">democratic confederalism</a>
- Mutual aid networks during COVID-19
- Argentina's <a href="recovered_factories.md" class="wikilink"
  title="recovered factories">recovered factories</a> sustaining
  themselves longer than traditional leftist parties have held power
- The influence of anarchist organizing methods on movements like
  <a href="Black_Lives_Matter.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Black Lives Matter">Black Lives Matter</a>

### Systematic Critiques of Berman's Framework

**On Organization vs. Hierarchy:** All respondents challenged Berman's
conflation of organization with hierarchy. Graham noted that anarchists
had moved into the labor movement by the fin-de-siècle, with
<a href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> placing "labor
struggles at the heart of revolutionary strategy" across Europe and
Latin America.[^13] Critics pointed to successful examples of
non-hierarchical coordination including
<a href="worker_cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperatives">worker cooperatives</a>,
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
networks, and indigenous social arrangements.

**On Democratic Legitimacy:** Sitrin's work emphasized that contemporary
anarchist-influenced movements reject representative democracy not out
of anti-democratic sentiment, but because they seek more direct forms of
democratic participation. Her documentation of Argentina's horizontal
neighborhood assemblies during the 2001 crisis showed people organizing
"for their survival and in the process, transform\[ing\] themselves and
their communities."[^14]

**On Political Effectiveness:** Hultner directly addressed Berman's
narrow definition of political success, arguing that while electoral
politics may achieve incremental reforms, it also "legitimizes and
perpetuates the very systems of domination" anarchists oppose. The
anarchist position emphasized building alternative institutions rather
than seeking permission from existing power structures.[^15]

## Criticism and Analysis

The debate highlighted fundamental disagreements about the nature of
political change and organizational effectiveness. While Berman argued
for working within existing democratic institutions through compromise
and traditional organizing methods, anarchist responses emphasized the
importance of <a href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a> - embodying
desired social relations in current organizing practices.

The exchange also revealed different conceptions of democracy itself,
with Berman defending representative democracy while anarchist
respondents advocated for more direct forms of democratic participation
and <a href="consensus_decision-making.md" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a>.

## Legacy

The "No Cheers For Anarchism" debate became a significant touchstone in
contemporary discussions about anarchist theory and practice. It
crystallized ongoing tensions between
<a href="social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democratic">social democratic</a> approaches to political
change and anarchist alternatives, while highlighting the continued
relevance of anarchist organizing methods in contemporary social
movements.

The debate continues to influence discussions about the effectiveness of
different political strategies, particularly in the context of movements
that employ <a href="horizontalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="horizontalism">horizontalism</a> and reject traditional
hierarchical organizing models.
