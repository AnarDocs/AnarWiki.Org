**Democratic Assemblies**(also known as **General Assemblies**,
**Popular Assemblies**, **Neighborhood Assemblies**, **Town
Assemblies**, **Citizens Assemblies**, **Village Assemblies**,
**Municipal Assemblies** and **Civic Assemblies**) are the organs of
local, grassroots, democratic decision-making within a
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
society. They also function as

providing an alternative way of making community-wide decisions outside
of the

## Function

Free people make their own decisions and come to agreements within their
communities, and develop shared means for putting these decisions into
practice. Anarchists hold to the idea of the â€˜popular assemblyâ€™, a place
where all the people who share some kind of community (be it a
neighbourhood, workplace or school/university) gather as a group at a
well established place and time (for example, once a fortnight at the
local park if the weathers good, or a town hall, maybe each
neighbourhood takes turns using a fortnight using the same town hall,
allowing 14 different neighbourhoods to use the same space).

At the popular assembly (a more radical and cool way of saying
â€˜meetingâ€™) there would be various roles that people would be volunteered
into (and could be kicked out of if doing a bad job) such as a mediator,
timekeeper, transcriber (someone who records what has been said) and any
other necessary roles to ensure peaceful discussions, or they could just
choose to not use these and have an unstructured discussion (this might
work better in groups that are familiar with each other) and could bring
them in if things started to get heated.

People would be free to propose various ideas or raise concerns to the
whole group, either anonymously submitting a letter or speaking
publicly. People could discuss and modify and idea until everyone agrees
on it, or fall back to majority voting if agreement is impossible (and
if some people hate a certain resolution so much, they are free to leave
for another neighbourhood, I talk about housing later which is important
for this).Â

People would discuss something for a long time, asking questions,
clarifying, debating and identifying concerns. Attendance to assemblies
would be voluntary, so if people became bored or donâ€™t care in the first
place, they are free not to attend. You might worry that this creates a
potential new class of rulers, but the fact that this class has no fixed
power and during times of crisis everyone would likely attend the
assembly.
