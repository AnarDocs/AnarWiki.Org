From David Graeber, *The Democracy Project*:

> In China around 400 B.C., for example, there was a philosophical
> movement that came to be known as the "School of the Tillers," which
> held that both merchants and government officials were both useless
> parasites, and attempted to create communities of equals where the
> only leadership would be by example, and the economy would be
> democratically regulated in unclaimed territories between the major
> states. Apparently, the movement was created by an alliance between
> renegade intellectuals who fled to such free villages and the peasant
> intellectuals they encountered there. Their ultimate aim appears to
> have been to gradually draw off defectors from surrounding kingdoms
> and thus, eventually, cause their collapse. This kind of encouragement
> of mass defection is a classic anarchist strategy. Needless to say
> they were not ultimately successful, but their ideas had enormous
> influence on court philosophers of later generations.[^1]
