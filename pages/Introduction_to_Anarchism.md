# Introduction To Anarchism

<a href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> is
the belief that individuals and communities should freely organise
themselves without rulers or hierarchical power structures. Anarchists
believe that concentrations of power are inherently harmful, requiring
violence (such as police and prisons) to maintain, and that systems of
privilege based on wealth, class, gender, race, age, or religion are
fundamentally unjust.

Under state authority and capitalism, Anarchists argue that true freedom
is impossible since access to basic needs is controlled through threats
of starvation and homelessness. In contrast, Anarchist societies would
make essentials like food, housing, and healthcare freely available
based on need rather than ability to pay.

Anarchist (decentralised, non-hierarchical, voluntary) societies have
existed throughout human history and continue to exist today. While
these communities often face opposition from the powerful and wealthy
who view them as threats, this wiki aims to explain anarchist theory and
practice from an Anarchist perspective, addressing common questions and
misconceptions.

## Why Is Anarchism Needed?

Without hierarchy, there is no one to impose their will or restrict your
choices. With genuine autonomy, you can choose your own path, develop
your own identity, express yourself freely, and form relationships based
on mutual desire rather than dependency or coercion. When no one has
power over you, you're free to think independently and act according to
your conscience.

Without artificial scarcity and commodification, there is no one who can
force you to conform through economic pressure or threaten you with
deprivation. With guaranteed access to resources and collective
prosperity, you can pursue your interests and develop your capabilities
without financial barriers. You can maintain privacy without economic
surveillance, build communities of affinity rather than necessity, and
express dissent without risking your survival.

Without enclosure and privatised property, you can't be kept from what
you need by claims of ownership or corporate control. With collective
stewardship of the commons and universal access, you can use any space
or resource based on need rather than ability to pay. When land and
resources aren't privately owned, you can't be excluded from shelter,
sustenance, or community. You can join or leave any community, access
knowledge and culture freely, maintain relationships across distances,
and find the spaces that allow you to thrive - all without having to
submit to property owners or corporate gatekeepers.[^1]
