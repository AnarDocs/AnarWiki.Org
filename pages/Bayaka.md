"Bayaka" is an umbrella term for a group of Central African foraging
peoples including the Ubangian language-speaking Baka, the Bantu
language-speaking Aka and Mbendjele and smaller groups including the
Mikaya, Luma, Gyeli, and Bongo. These groups generally use variations of
the word "Bayaka" to refer to the area's foraging peoples, and they
group together the more recent agricultural settlers as the "bilo". The
territories of each Bayaka people is marked by rivers.[^1]

# Culture

The Bayaka's moral code of *ekila* ensures sharing in all aspects of
life:

> "Ekila taboos serve to enforce and define proper sharing: By not
> sharing animals and meat properly among all present, a hunter’s ekila
> is ruined so that he is unsuccessful. If parents of infants eat ekila
> animals, it can provoke illness and even death in their children. If
> either husband or wife inappropriately shares his or her sexuality
> with others outside their marriage, both partners have their ekila
> ruined. A menstruating woman is ekila and must share her menstrual
> blood (also ekila) with spirits so that her male relatives continue to
> find food. Even laughter should be shared properly. Laughter shared
> between people in camp during the evening makes the forest rejoice,
> whereas laughing at hunted animals ruins the hunter’s ekila."[^2]

Bayaka women and men preserve gender egalitarianism through alternating
rituals. The men's ritual dance is called the *ejengi*, and the women's
is called *ngoku*. During the women's *ngoku* ritual, the women sing
songs playfully taunting the men. One song says, "The penis gives birth
to nothing, only urine!" Another says, "We the Yaka! We the Yaka! Twice
the intelligence \[of men\]!" Such songs place a check on the men's
ability to dominate. The men believe that the women's song and dance
draws in forest spirits and please the forest itself.[^3]

A courtship dance, called the *elande*, involves a line of men and a
line of women, each line making polyphonic noises. A girl goes over to
the men's line and strikes a boy. With him in pursuit, she runs back to
the women's line. The boy then strikes one of the girls, and she chases
him as he runs back to the men's line. The ritual culminates in communal
laughter.[^4]

Aka men, who watch children while the women do their share of the
hunting, are considered the best fathers in the world. Anthropologist
Barry Hewlett found that Aka fathers are within reach of babies about
50% of the time, more than fathers in any other society on Earth.[^5]

The Baka traditionally did not believe in any afterlife. One told
anthropologist James Woodburn, "When you're dead, you're dead and that's
the end of you."[^6]

# Decisions

Decisions are made by consensus at horizontal assemblies called
*mosambo*. This assembly meets twice a day and and also serves as a
place to share news, opinions, and advice. The tone is generally
lighthearted, and humor is often used. Even after a decision is made,
there is no coercive power to make people obey it. People who disagree
with a major decision typically just leave and join a different
camp.[^7]

# Economy

The Mbendjele contribute according to ability and share according to
need. The elderly and differently-abled who contribute less are not
excluded from getting their fair share. A Mbenjele saying encapsulates
their communist approach: "Since we have easy hands we just give it."
The Bayaka societies are examples of what James Woodburn called
"immediate return" societies.[^8]

Some Bayka peoples are notable for the women's prominent role in
hunting. Aka[^9] and Baka women regularly hunt just as the men do.[^10]
Among the Mbendjle, men generally hunt, fish, and gather honey, while
women generally gather yams, edible leaves, insects, mushrooms,
vegetables, fruit, small fish, and crustaceans.[^11]

The sharing of meat is governed by a set of rules of *ekila*. The hunter
gets the heart, other men get the liver and kidneys, a dog who
participated gets the lungs, and the rest of the meat must be shared
with everyone present.[^12]

Some Bayaka specialize in spirit guardianship, song composition,
healing, and public speaking. These specialist roles bring no special
privilege. Though only a man can have the specialist role of elephant
hunter, the other specialist roles are open to women as well as
men.[^13]

At present, most mbendjele live as full-time foragers for about
two-thirds of the year and spend the year's remainder laboring and
trading near the villages.[^14]

# Environment

The Bayaka have a taboo on overly destructive weapons such as guns, and
they hunt using only their traditional nets and spears.[^15]

Among the Bayaka, ekila hunting taboos are, according to Jerome Lewis,
"the key to the safe enjoyment of forest resources and the guarantee of
their continued abundance." There is a taboo against laughing at
animals.[^16]

Bayaka communities are threatened, on one hand, by ecologically
destructive practices of logging and poaching,[^17] and on the other
hand, by top-down conservation efforts. World Wildlife Fund rangers have
attacked and murdered Bayaka people living on their ancestral
lands.[^18]

# Crime

When someone behaves wrongly, one or two elderly women will mockingly
renact the event in a practice called *moadjo*. The performance ends
when the wrongdoer finally joins the rest of the audience and
laughs.[^19]
