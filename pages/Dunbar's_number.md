# Dunbar's Number and Anarchism: A Critical Assessment

## Overview

**Dunbar's Number** is frequently deployed as an argument against the
viability of
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>,
particularly large-scale anarchist societies. Critics claim that since
humans can only maintain stable relationships with approximately 150
people, anarchist organisation beyond this limit is impossible or will
inevitably devolve into chaos. This argument fundamentally
misunderstands both Dunbar's research and anarchist theory, confusing
personal relationship management with political organisation.

## What Dunbar's Number Actually Measures

<a href="Robin_Dunbar.md" class="wikilink" title="Robin Dunbar">Robin
Dunbar</a>'s research identified a cognitive limit to the number of
stable social relationships an individual can maintain simultaneously -
roughly 150 people with whom one knows "who each person is and how each
person relates to every other person."[^1] This refers specifically to
intimate personal knowledge of complex interpersonal dynamics within a
single cohesive group.

Critically, Dunbar's number applies to **personal social networks**, not
political or economic systems. Neither
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
nor any other large-scale system requires individuals to have intimate
personal relationships with more than 150 people. A factory worker
doesn't need to know the personal relationships between thousands of
other workers to function within the industrial system. Similarly,
anarchist organisation doesn't require each person to maintain intimate
bonds with everyone in society.

## The Multiplication Principle

Dunbar's number can be multiplied through network effects. If each
person in a 150-person group maintains relationships with 150 different
people, this creates potential connections between 22,500 individuals
through overlapping social networks. This multiplication effect allows
for coordination and communication across much larger populations
without violating cognitive limits.

Historical examples demonstrate this principle. The
<a href="Haudenosaunee.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haudenosaunee">Haudenosaunee</a> (Iroquois Confederacy) organised
hundreds of thousands of people through federated clan and tribal
structures, each maintaining Dunbar-scale intimate groups while
participating in larger political coordination.[^2]

## Dunbar's Number as an Argument for Anarchism

Rather than undermining anarchism, Dunbar's number actually supports
anarchist organisational models over state-based systems. States attempt
to govern millions of people through top-down hierarchical control,
creating vast psychological distances between rulers and ruled that make
responsive governance impossible.
<a href="Centralisation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Centralisation">Centralisation</a> violates human-scale
organisation by concentrating decision-making power in remote
institutions.

Anarchist federalism, conversely, builds from the bottom up through
voluntary association of human-scale groups. The
<a href="Hutterites.md" class="wikilink" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>
provide a compelling example: when communities reach approximately 150
people, they establish new settlements while maintaining fellowship and
cooperation with existing communities.[^3] This practice has sustained
their decentralised religious communities for over 500 years,
demonstrating that Dunbar's limits can be accommodated without
sacrificing large-scale coordination.

## Large-Scale Anarchist Societies in History

Archaeological evidence reveals numerous pre-state societies that
exceeded Dunbar's number by orders of magnitude while maintaining
apparently egalitarian social structures. Many Neolithic urban
settlements housed thousands of inhabitants without clear evidence of
hierarchical control or warfare.

<a href="Çatalhöyük.md" class="wikilink" title="Çatalhöyük">Çatalhöyük</a>
in Turkey supported 3,000-8,000 residents for over 1,000 years
(7100-5700 BCE) with remarkably egalitarian architecture and no apparent
ruling class.[^4] Similar patterns appear at sites like
<a href="Mehrgarh.md" class="wikilink" title="Mehrgarh">Mehrgarh</a> in
Pakistan and numerous settlements throughout the Indus Valley
civilisation.

These societies demonstrate that humans can organise at scales far
exceeding Dunbar's number without resorting to hierarchical domination.
They worked **with** rather than **against** cognitive limits through
decentralised coordination mechanisms.

## The Administrative Challenge

<a href="Andrew_Flood.md" class="wikilink" title="Andrew Flood">Andrew
Flood</a> has argued that anarchist organisations must acknowledge
Dunbar's limitations and develop appropriate administrative structures
to function beyond intimate group size.[^5] This doesn't require
abandoning anarchist principles, but rather creating transparent,
accountable systems for coordination and communication.

Flood identifies several key requirements for scaling anarchist
organisation:

- **Transparent membership expectations** clearly defining roles and
  responsibilities
- **Standardised administrative processes** that don't depend on
  personal relationships
- **Formal communication systems** ensuring information reaches all
  members
- **Rotation of administrative roles** preventing the crystallisation of
  permanent leadership

These mechanisms allow groups to transcend Dunbar's limits while
maintaining horizontal organisation and democratic decision-making.

## Scale-Independent Anarchism

<a href="William_Gillis.md" class="wikilink" title="William Gillis">William
Gillis</a> argues that anarchism represents a "scale-independent
proposition" - the critique of domination applies equally at
interpersonal and societal levels.[^6] The tendency toward coercion and
manipulation exists in intimate relationships just as much as in large
institutions. Focusing exclusively on small-scale organisation doesn't
eliminate these dynamics but merely relocates them.

Gillis contends that the "small is beautiful" argument often masks a
retreat from addressing systemic problems. Domestic violence, emotional
manipulation, and social exclusion occur regularly within Dunbar-scale
groups. Anarchism's value lies not in limiting ourselves to small
groups, but in developing principled resistance to domination at every
scale.

## Contemporary Applications

Modern anarchist movements demonstrate successful coordination beyond
Dunbar's number through federated structures. The
<a href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
movement in Chiapas organises hundreds of autonomous communities through
regional assemblies and rotating councils, maintaining democratic
participation across a population exceeding 300,000.[^7]

Similarly, the
<a href="Kurdish.md" class="wikilink" title="Kurdish">Kurdish</a>
democratic confederalism project in Rojava has implemented direct
democratic structures across millions of people through nested councils
and regional federations, explicitly drawing on anarchist and
libertarian socialist theory.[^8]

## Criticism and Limitations

Recent research has challenged aspects of Dunbar's original analysis. A
2021 study using updated datasets and different statistical methods
produced widely varying estimates ranging from 16 to 520, suggesting
that specifying any particular number may have limited value.[^9]

Additionally, digital communication technologies may be altering the
constraints on relationship maintenance that originally informed
Dunbar's calculations. Online social networks allow for forms of
coordination and mutual aid that transcend traditional geographic and
cognitive limitations.

## Conclusion

Dunbar's number poses no fundamental challenge to anarchist theory or
practice. It describes cognitive limits on intimate personal
relationships, not the boundaries of possible political organisation.
Anarchist federalism actually works **with** these limitations by
building large-scale coordination from voluntary association of
human-scale groups.

Historical evidence demonstrates that egalitarian societies have
successfully organised at scales far exceeding Dunbar's number through
decentralised coordination mechanisms. Contemporary movements continue
this tradition, developing new forms of horizontal organisation adapted
to modern conditions.

Rather than limiting anarchist ambitions, understanding cognitive
constraints can inform better organisational practices that maintain
human-scale intimacy within larger structures of mutual aid and
voluntary cooperation. The challenge is not to remain small, but to
scale up without reproducing the alienation and domination
characteristic of hierarchical systems.
