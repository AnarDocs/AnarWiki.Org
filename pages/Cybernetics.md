# Anarchist Cybernetics

## Overview

**Anarchist Cybernetics** is a theoretical framework connecting
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
with "<a   href="cybernetics.md" class="wikilink"
title="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, the science of self-organization,
control, and communication in systems. The approach demonstrates how
anarchist principles of decentralization, autonomy, and
self-organization align with cybernetic understandings of how complex
systems function effectively without hierarchical command
structures.[^1]

The theory emerged from observations that cybernetic principles of
self-organizing systems parallel anarchist organizational forms,
suggesting that decentralized, non-hierarchical structures can be both
effective and scalable. Rather than requiring top-down control,
anarchist cybernetics proposes that systems achieve stability and adapt
to change through autonomous parts coordinating democratically.[^2]

This synthesis, emerging in the 1960s and experiencing renewed interest
today, offers potential solutions to one of anarchism's most persistent
challenges: how to scale non-hierarchical organization beyond local
communities while maintaining principles of autonomy and mutual aid.

## Origins and Historical Development

### Etymology

The term "cybernetics" derives from the ancient Greek word *kybernetes*
(κυβερνήτης), meaning the act of steering a ship. The philosopher
"<a   href="Plato.md" class="wikilink" title="Plato">Plato</a> used this term
in the Fourth Century BCE to compare steering a ship to governing a
city-state. The same root gives us the modern word "govern" (from Latin
*gubernare*).[^3]

While the term's origins lie in hierarchical concepts of governance,
modern cybernetics, established by Norbert Wiener after the Second World
War, developed into a science concerned with self-organization in
mechanical, electrical, biological, and social systems.[^4]

### Early Connections to Anarchism

The explicit connection between anarchism and cybernetics first appeared
in 1963 in the pages of *Anarchy*, a journal edited by
"<a   href="Colin_Ward.md" class="wikilink" title="Colin Ward">Colin Ward</a>
and published by
"<a   href="Freedom_Press.md" class="wikilink" title="Freedom Press">Freedom
Press</a> between 1961 and 1970.

"<a   href="William_Grey_Walter.md" class="wikilink"
title="William Grey Walter">William Grey Walter</a>, a neurophysiologist
and pioneering cyberneticist, wrote an article titled "The Development
and Significance of Cybernetics" for *Anarchy* in 1963. Walter was the
father of "<a   href="Nicholas_Walter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nicholas Walter">Nicholas Walter</a>, a frequent contributor to
the *Freedom* newspaper and close associate of Colin Ward. Grey Walter
had been "a communist fellow-traveler before the Second World War and an
anarchist sympathizer after it."[^5]

Walter's experiments with self-steering robotic "tortoises" demonstrated
emergent behaviors without central control. In his *Anarchy* article,
Walter concluded by noting the similarities between brain organization
and anarchist approaches to organization, writing that "we find no boss
in the brain, no oligarchic ganglion or glandular Big Brother."[^6] He
described how different parts of the brain relate to one another through
"free and equal intercourse," stating that "if we must identify
biological and political systems our own brains would seem to illustrate
the capacity and limitations of an anarcho-syndicalist community."[^7]

### John D. McEwan's Contribution

Following Walter's article, John D. McEwan published "Anarchism and the
Cybernetics of Self-Organising Systems" in *Anarchy* later in 1963.
McEwan was a mathematician who graduated from the University of St.
Andrews and worked on diagnostic programming for electronic computers.
His contribution, though brief, proved foundational for understanding
the connections between anarchism and cybernetics.[^8]

McEwan articulated how cybernetics challenges the hierarchical
assumptions of traditional governance. He wrote that "the basic premise
of the governmentalist – namely, that any society must incorporate some
mechanisms for overall control – is certainly true, if we use 'control'
in the sense of 'maintain a large number of critical variables within
limits of toleration.'" However, he noted that "the error of the
governmentalist is to think that 'incorporate some mechanism for
control' is always equivalent to 'include a fixed isolatable control
unit to which the rest, i.e. the majority, of the system is
subservient.'"[^9]

McEwan challenged the "governmentalist" assumption that control required
"a fixed isolatable control unit to which the rest of the system is
subservient," proposing instead that effective control emerges through
autonomous coordination. He drew connections between
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>'s understanding of natural harmony and cybernetic
principles, noting how Kropotkin described anarchist society as one that
"looks for harmony in an ever-changing and fugitive equilibrium between
a multitude of varied forces and influences of every kind, following
their own course."[^10]

### Colin Ward's Synthesis

In his 1966 essay "Anarchism as a Theory of Organization,"
"<a   href="Colin_Ward.md" class="wikilink" title="Colin Ward">Colin Ward</a>
synthesized these ideas, writing that "cybernetic theory with its
emphasis on self-organising systems, and speculation about the ultimate
social effects of automation, leads in a similar revolutionary
direction" as anarchism. He connected cybernetics to anarchist
principles of "autonomous groups, spontaneous order, workers' control,
the federative principle."[^11]

## Key Concepts

### Self-Organization

At the center of anarchist cybernetics is the concept of
**self-organization**. While initially developed in the context of
technical systems, self-organization was applied to social systems,
providing a framework for understanding how people can organize
collectively without structural hierarchies of command.

Self-organization in cybernetics refers to how systems maintain
stability and adapt to environmental changes through the autonomous
action of their component parts rather than through centralized control.
This directly parallels anarchist organizational principles.[^12]

Cybernetics demonstrates that complex systems can maintain stability and
achieve goals through local autonomy and feedback loops rather than
hierarchical command. This principle directly supports anarchist
critiques of state authority and hierarchical organization.

Key concepts include:

- **Requisite Variety** (Ashby's Law): Systems must match the complexity
  of their environment to remain viable
- **Autonomy of Parts**: Local decision-making enables rapid adaptation
  to change
- **Feedback Loops**: Information circulation enables coordination
  without central control
- **Emergent Order**: Complex organization arises from simple local
  interactions

### Variety and Ashby's Law

A central tenet of cybernetics, known as **Ashby's Law** after Ross
Ashby, states that a system must be able to have the same level of
variety as its environment in order to survive. When the environment
changes from one state to another, the system must be able to change in
turn. Systems achieve this variety and adaptability through their parts
having a high level of autonomy to act as they see fit in their
particular niche of the environment.[^13]

If systems are too rigid and lack this capacity for variety, they become
overwhelmed and break down. For anarchists, this systemic rigidity has
another implication: **domination**. Authoritarian coercion acts to
restrain the variety of the system, forcing everyone to fit into a
limited number of possible roles and behaviors, curtailing freedom and
autonomy.

### Heterarchy vs Hierarchy

Warren McCulloch's concept of **heterarchy** made it possible to
understand complex systems outside the restrictive dichotomy between
hierarchies and flat markets, emphasizing instead self-organization,
feedback loops, and complex networks.[^14]

McEwan distinguished between "anatomical hierarchy" (structural
hierarchy of command) and "functional hierarchy" (logical ordering of
decision-making). In anarchist cybernetics, functional hierarchy can
exist without anatomical hierarchy when the same people participate in
different functions at different times, being party to decision-making
about the scope of their autonomy within the organization as a
whole.[^15]

### Redefining Control

Cybernetics redefines **control** not as something done to a system or
group of people but as something a system or group itself does. For
anarchism, this means people self-organizing to govern themselves. As
cyberneticist Allenna Leonard described it, control in viable systems is
"the control of a skier going down a hill" – finding collective balance
rather than compliance with higher authority.[^16]

## Historical Applications

### Soviet Cybernetics and OGAS

During the Soviet era, mathematician
"<a   href="Victor_Glushkov.md" class="wikilink"
title="Victor Glushkov">Victor Glushkov</a> developed a grand plan to
replace centralized economic planning with a decentralized autonomous
computational network called **OGAS** (All States Automated System).
Presented to Khrushchev in 1962, this project aimed to implement a
workers-oriented, anti-bureaucratic, non-hierarchical system of economic
coordination through distributed computing and feedback mechanisms.[^17]

The original design envisioned a vast decentralized computational
network capable of processing real-time feedback and handling complex
dynamics simulations. Rather than relying on centralized state planning,
the system would enable self-organization through networked
coordination. Glushkov proposed OGAS as a decentralized computational
network designed to replace centralized state planning with autonomous,
non-hierarchical coordination.[^18]

However, the Soviet government eventually abandoned the project in favor
of the less threatening Kosygin-Liberman market-based reforms, as OGAS
was perceived as a threat to centralized state authority. The project
was ultimately rejected by Soviet authorities who perceived it as
threatening their control.[^19]

Despite official prohibition during Stalin's regime, cybernetics grew
significantly in the Soviet Union after 1953, thanks largely to private
home seminars led by mathematician Aleksei Lyapunov. By 1967,
cybernetics in the Soviet Union counted five hundred active research
institutes and tens of thousands of researchers.[^20]

### Project Cybersyn in Chile

The most developed historical experiment in cybernetic socialism
occurred in "<a   href="Salvador_Allende.md" class="wikilink"
title="Salvador Allende">Salvador Allende</a>'s Chile. In 1971, the
Allende government contacted British cyberneticist
"<a   href="Stafford_Beer.md" class="wikilink" title="Stafford Beer">Stafford
Beer</a> to implement a distributed decision support system for managing
the national economy while respecting worker autonomy and avoiding
top-down control.[^21]

**Project Cybersyn** consisted of a network of data-collecting telex
machines, statistical modeling software, economic simulator software,
and an operations room where observers could oversee data flows and
respond to emergencies. Beer's goal was to develop self-regulating
factories and assign decision-making power entirely to workers-owned
structures in a way compatible with the larger national economy, aimed
to enable real-time worker self-management of the economy through
networked communication systems.[^22][^23]

The system came close to full functionality and helped defeat an earlier
coup attempt in 1972. However, when the CIA-backed military coup
succeeded in September 1973, resulting in Allende's death, the military
destroyed the Cybersyn operations room and entirely dismantled the
system. The project remained unfinished when Pinochet's coup destroyed
the Allende government.[^24]

### Stafford Beer's Radicalization

The Chilean experience profoundly affected Stafford Beer. Following
Allende's death, Beer abandoned his luxurious consultant lifestyle,
moving to a small cottage in Wales without running water. In his 1973
lecture series "Designing Freedom" for the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, Beer articulated a decidedly political vision emphasizing
decentralization and autonomy.

Beer stated: "According to the analysis of centralization and
decentralization with which we began, it is clear that there should be a
major devolution of power. I think it should be open to a community to
organize its social services (education, health, welfare) exactly as it
pleases... I think that workers should in general be free to organize
their own work."[^25]

Beer argued that freedom must be designed into systems as an output
rather than being lost "not by accident, but as the output of a system
designed to curb liberty."[^26]

## The Viable System Model

Stafford Beer's **Viable System Model** (VSM) represents a framework for
understanding how any effective, self-organized system maintains both
autonomy of its parts and coherence as an overall system. The VSM
provides a framework for understanding how organizations can function
effectively without hierarchical command structures.[^27]

The VSM identifies five different functions that any viable
self-organized social system embodies, representing essential
functions:[^28]

**System One**: The primary activities of the organization, carried out
autonomously. These activities and units are the purpose of the
organization. Implementation of primary activities.

**System Two**: Communication between autonomous parts to ensure minimal
coordination and prevent activities of one part from undermining
another.

**System Three**: Planning function that brings primary activities
together under shared goals, ensuring coherence toward common direction.
Collective planning toward shared goals.

**System Four**: Strategic function looking outside the organization to
the future, assessing environmental changes and enabling adjustment.
Environmental monitoring and adaptation.

**System Five**: Identity or ethos of the organization, providing values
that guide all activities. Organizational identity and values.

Crucially, these functions represent logical rather than structural
hierarchies. Beer emphasized that these functions need not be arranged
hierarchically. Through democratic deliberation and collective
decision-making, each function can be replicated without hierarchical
governance structures. The same people can fulfill different functions
at different times, similar to anarchist federation models.

Jon Walker, a worker at the Suma wholefoods cooperative in the UK, wrote
to Beer asking whether the VSM required authority and obedience. Beer
replied that "effective organisational structure can be based upon
individual freedom, \[and\] authoritarian management is not the only
alternative."[^29]

The VSM demonstrates **recursion**: any viable system is itself a
component of a larger viable system, and each component is itself
comprised of smaller viable systems. This reflects how anarchist
federations operate, with autonomous parts at each level coordinating
through functionally higher decision-making processes while maintaining
democratic participation.[^30]

## The Scale Problem

One of the most fundamental challenges anarchist cybernetics addresses
is the **problem of scale** – how decentralized, non-hierarchical
organization can function efficiently at large scales. Aurora Apolito
identifies scale as "perhaps the most fundamental problem of
anarchism."[^31]

Historically, critics have argued that anarchism works well locally but
fails to provide convincing theory for scaling up. While anarchist
principles work well in small communities, critics question whether
decentralized, non-hierarchical organization can effectively manage
large-scale services like transportation, healthcare, and resource
distribution.

Anarchist cybernetics responds by showing that large-scale coordination
emerges through networked self-organization rather than centralized
planning. The key insight is that effective large-scale systems require
sufficient **informational complexity** to function. Historical analysis
suggests societies attempting significant scale growth with limited
information-processing capacity tend toward authoritarian forms, while
sufficient informational complexity enables diverse organizational
forms.[^32]

Victor Glushkov's OGAS and Stafford Beer's Cybersyn both attempted to
greatly increase information-processing capacity as necessary means for
decentralized non-authoritarian communism that could scale to large
networks.[^33]

### Cybernetic Solutions

Contemporary theorists propose addressing scale through:

**Integrated Information Theory**: Maximizing the informational
complexity that exists collectively but not in isolated subsystems,
encouraging cooperation over competition.[^34]

**Multilayered Networks**: Modern anarchist cybernetics proposes
understanding large-scale organization through multilayered networks
where nodes (such as individual cooperatives) connect through multiple
simultaneous networking structures representing different forms of
sharing – services, resources, information. Different forms of sharing
and services operate as interconnected network layers, each with
distinct connectivity patterns and dynamics. Each layer changes
dynamically over time in interaction with other layers.[^35][^36]

Within these networks, **communities** serve as intermediate structures
between individual nodes and the entire network. The overlapping
structure of communities – some based on identity, others on shared
projects – provides the crucial intermediate step between small-scale
local connectivity and large-scale coordination.[^37]

**Effective Complexity**: Using measures of structured (non-random)
complexity rather than simple profit optimization to guide resource
allocation and organizational development.[^38]

## Contemporary Relevance

### Mutual Aid Networks

The "<a   href="coronavirus_pandemic.md" class="wikilink"
title="coronavirus pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a> of 2020 saw
thousands of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
groups form across the UK and internationally, demonstrating anarchist
principles in practice. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated cybernetic
principles in action through spontaneous mutual aid networks.[^39]

Anarchist cybernetics provides a framework for understanding how these
networks function as viable self-organized systems. Mutual aid networks
embody VSM functions exhibited:

- Autonomous local groups working in communities (System One operations)
- Communication channels like WhatsApp groups for coordination through
  communication platforms (System Two)
- Formalized platforms like Slack or Loomio for collective planning via
  forums and assemblies (Systems Three and Four)
- Anticipating change (System Four)
- Maintaining commitment to mutual aid principles and shared identity
  and principles (System Five)

The challenge is ensuring functional hierarchy does not ossify into
structural hierarchy but remains open to democratic participation.[^40]

### Occupy Wall Street

"<a   href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> demonstrated anarchist
cybernetics in practice. Working groups had autonomy, coordinated
through formal and informal communication, while being bound by
decisions made at the General Assembly or Spokes Council. These
institutions were not bodies of power above working groups but forums
for consensual agreement all could participate in.[^41]

The creation of the Spokes Council due to the General Assembly's
inability to handle required planning reflects the VSM's capacity to
capture insights that practitioners of self-organization often reach
themselves, demonstrating that the VSM is not a blueprint but a way of
understanding fundamental truths of effective self-organization.[^42]

### Worker Cooperatives

Anarchist cybernetics has been applied in worker cooperatives such as
the Pagkaki cooperative in Greece and Suma wholefoods cooperative in the
UK. Jon Walker described how in workers' cooperatives, the same people
embody different VSM functions at different times: "when the work was
being done they were Operation, when planning was necessary they
articulated the Metasystem. The fundamental co-operative principle of
self-management means that there is no clear division in the roles of
people working within the group."[^43]

### Digital Technologies

Modern information technologies provide infrastructure for cybernetic
organization:

- Peer-to-peer networks enabling decentralized coordination
- Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies
- Open source collaboration models
- Platform cooperativism

## Tendencies

### Cybernetic Communism

**Cybernetic Communism** proposes computational approaches to communist
economic organization that avoid both market mechanisms and centralized
state planning. This tendency emphasizes maximizing **integrated
information** – the informational complexity in a system not reducible
to separate parts – as an alternative to profit maximization.[^44]

Integrated information measures causal interconnectedness of subsystems.
Maximizing it favors cooperation over competition (competition decreases
interconnectedness), eliminates barriers to knowledge sharing
(inaccessibility decreases causal connectedness), and prevents wealth
accumulation (concentration separates subsystems). This provides a
"collectivity that maximizes individual agency because it maximizes the
degree of causal influence, hence of possible agency, of each individual
subsystem."[^45]

Cybernetic Communism identifies two classes of instruments for
implementing this optimization:

**Instruments of connectedness**: Technologies increasing mutual causal
influence – public transportation, P2P networks, wireless mesh networks,
distributed computing resources like Holochain, libraries, open source
initiatives, border abolition. Projects like Sci-Hub exemplify
instruments facilitating free circulation of knowledge.[^46]

**Instruments of complexity**: Culture generating effective complexity –
philosophy, science, visual arts, music, poetry. These increase
complexity without generating profit, making them crucial to cybernetic
communism but vulnerable to market-driven dynamics.[^47]

### Related Developments

Other anarchist thinkers have engaged with cybernetics over the years.
"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> referenced cybernetics
primarily regarding high technology.
"<a   href="Ruth_Kinna.md" class="wikilink" title="Ruth Kinna">Ruth Kinna</a>
discussed it in *Anarchism: A Beginner's Guide* (2005). In the
Netherlands, philosopher Marius de Geus explored it at length in a 1989
book, as did Provo activist Roel van Duijn in *Message of a Wise
Kabouter*.[^48]

Recent years have seen increasing interest in radical articulations of
cybernetics by libertarian Marxists such as the General Intellect Unit
and Jeremy Gross, as well as anarchist readings by John Duda, Aurora
Apolito, and Tektological Serendipity.[^49]

## Criticism

### Concerns About Authoritarianism

Some critics link cybernetics to "authoritarianism and top-down control"
and disaster capitalism that treats people as manipulable and
disposable. The term's etymological origins in Plato's vision of
philosopher-king rule and its historical associations with management
consultancy and military applications fuel these concerns.[^50]

Anarchist cybernetics addresses these concerns by emphasizing that
cybernetic principles of self-organization fundamentally oppose
hierarchical command structures. The science of cybernetics itself is
politically neutral – its application can serve either authoritarian or
libertarian ends depending on implementation.

### Technology and Determinism

Critics worry that cybernetic approaches may lead to technological
determinism or reduce social organization to mechanical processes.
Critics warn against assuming technology automatically produces
liberation. Market mechanisms emerged from information systems meant to
enable socialist planning, suggesting that tools alone don't determine
outcomes.[^51]

Anarchist cybernetics responds that the VSM and related concepts are
tools for understanding organizational dynamics, not blueprints to be
mechanically applied. As Beer stated, they represent ways of thinking
through organizational problems that are more or less useful, not true
or false models.[^52]

### Mathematical Abstraction

Some anarchists and autonomist communists object to mathematical
approaches to social organization, viewing them as inherently aligned
with financial capitalism. However, this conflates the profit-driven
mathematics of markets with mathematical analysis generally. The
communist and anarchist traditions have historically been
techno-optimist, viewing sophisticated analysis as essential for seizing
and managing means of production.[^53]

The challenge is not avoiding mathematical methods but developing
appropriate mathematical frameworks that capture values beyond profit –
complexity, diversity, autonomy, and mutual aid – rather than borrowing
market mechanisms from capitalism.

### Complexity Requirements

Implementing cybernetic communism requires significant
information-processing capacity. Historical attempts failed partly due
to insufficient computational resources and mathematical tools.[^54]

Questions remain about how cybernetic systems prevent capture by
authoritarian forces or market dynamics, particularly during transition
periods.

## Conclusion

Anarchist cybernetics offers frameworks for understanding and
implementing self-organization at scale, potentially resolving tensions
between local autonomy and large-scale coordination. While not a
complete solution, it provides tools for thinking beyond the false
dichotomy of hierarchical states versus atomized markets. Success
depends not on technology alone but on developing appropriate social
practices, mathematical models, and organizational cultures that
maximize both individual agency and collective capacity.
