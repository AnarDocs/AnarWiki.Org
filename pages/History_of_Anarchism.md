# History of Anarchism

According to different scholars, the history of anarchism either goes
back to ancient and prehistoric ideologies and social structures, or
begins in the 19th century as a formal movement. As scholars and
anarchist philosophers have held a range of views on what anarchism
means, it is difficult to outline its history unambiguously. Some feel
anarchism is a distinct, well-defined movement stemming from
19th-century class conflict, while others identify anarchist traits long
before the earliest civilisations existed.

Prehistoric society existed without formal hierarchies, which some
anthropologists have described as similar to anarchism. The first traces
of formal anarchist thought can be found in
"<a   href="ancient_Greece.md" class="wikilink" title="ancient Greece">ancient
Greece</a> and
"<a   href="Ancient_China.md" class="wikilink" title="China">China</a>, where
numerous philosophers questioned the necessity of the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> and declared
the moral right of the individual to live free from coercion. During the
Middle Ages, some religious sects espoused libertarian thought, and the
Age of Enlightenment, and the attendant rise of rationalism and science,
signalled the birth of the modern anarchist movement. Alongside
"<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>, modern
anarchism was a significant part of the workers' movement at the end of
the 19th century. Modernism, industrialisation, reaction to capitalism
and mass migration helped anarchism to flourish and to spread around the
globe. Major anarchist schools of thought sprouted up as anarchism grew
as a social movement, particularly

title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>, and
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a>. As the
workers' movement grew, the divide between anarchists and Marxists grew
as well. The two currents formally split at the fifth congress of the
"<a   href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a> in 1872. Anarchists
participated enthusiastically in the
"<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, but as soon as the
"<a   href="Bolsheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>
established their authority, anarchist movements, most notably the
"<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">Makhnovshchina</a> and the
"<a   href="Kronstadt_rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, were harshly
suppressed.

Anarchism played a historically prominent role during the
"<a   href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, when an anarchist
territory was established in Catalonia.
"<a   href="Revolutionary_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a> was
organised along anarcho-syndicalist lines, with powerful labor unions in
the cities and collectivised agriculture in the country, but ended in
the defeat of the anarchists.

In the 1960s, anarchism re-emerged as a global political and cultural
force. In association with the New Left and Post-left tendencies,
anarchism has influenced social movements that espouse personal autonomy
and direct democracy. It has also played major roles in the
anti-globalization movement,
"<a   href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
revolution, and
"<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> revolution.

## Background

There has been some controversy over the definition of anarchism and
hence its history.[^1] One group of scholars considers anarchism
strictly associated with class struggle. Others feel this perspective is
far too narrow.[^2] While the former group examines anarchism as a
phenomenon that occurred during the 19th century, the latter group looks
to ancient history to trace anarchism's roots.[^3] Anarchist philosopher
"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> describes the continuation
of the "legacy of freedom" of humankind (the revolutionary moments) that
existed throughout history, in contrast with the "legacy of domination"
which consists of states, capitalism and other organisational forms.[^4]
The three most common forms of defining anarchism are the "etymological"
(an-archei, without a ruler, but anarchism is not merely a negation);
the "anti-statism" (while this seems to be pivotal, it certainly does
not describe the essence of anarchism); and the "anti-authoritarian"
definition (denial of every kind of authority, which over-simplifies
anarchism).[^5] Along with the definition debates, the question of
whether it is a philosophy, a theory or a series of actions complicates
the issue.[^6] Philosophy professor Alejandro de Agosta proposes that
anarchism is "a decentralised federation of philosophies as well as
practices and ways of life, forged in different communities and
affirming diverse geohistories".[^7]

## Precursors

### Prehistoric and Ancient Era

Many scholars of anarchism, including anthropologists
"<a   href="Harold_Barclay.md" class="wikilink" title="Harold Barclay">Harold
Barclay</a> and
"<a   href="David_Graeber.md" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a>, claim that some form of anarchy dates back to prehistory.
The longest period of human existence, that before the recorded history
of human society, was without a separate class of established authority
or formal political institutions.[^8] Long before anarchism emerged as a
distinct perspective, humans lived for thousands of years in
self-governing societies without a special ruling or political
class.[^9] It was only after the rise of hierarchical societies that
anarchist ideas were formulated as a critical response to, and a
rejection of, coercive political institutions and hierarchical social
relationships.[^10]

"<a   href="Taoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, which
developed in ancient China, has been linked to anarchist thought by some
scholars. Taoist sages
"<a   href="Lao_Tzu.md" class="wikilink" title="Lao Tzu">Lao Tzu</a> and
"<a   href="Zhuang_Zhou.md" class="wikilink" title="Zhuang Zhou">Zhuang
Zhou</a>, whose principles were grounded in an "anti-polity" stance and
a rejection of any kind of involvement in political movements or
organisations, developed a philosophy of "non-rule" in the *Tao Te
Ching* and the *Zhuangzi*. Taoists were trying to live in harmony with
nature according to the precepts of their religion by doing this.[^11]
There is an ongoing debate whether exhorting rulers not to rule is
somehow an anarchist objective.[^12] A new generation of Taoist thinkers
with anarchic leanings appeared during the chaotic Wei-Jin period.
Taoism and neo-Taoism had principles more akin to a philosophical
anarchism—an attempt to delegitimise the state and question its
morality—and were pacifist schools of thought, in contrast with their
Western counterparts some centuries later.[^13] Former professor
emeritus of history at California State University Milton W. Meyer has
stated that in his opinion, early Taoists were "early anarchists" who
believed in concepts often found in states such as anti-intellectualism
and "laissez-faire".[^14] Taoist anarchists did not believe in religious
traditions such as rituals and the concepts of morality and good and
evil.[^15]

Some convictions and ideas deeply held by modern anarchists were first
expressed in ancient Greece.[^16] The first known political usage of the
word *anarchy* appeared in plays by
"<a   href="Aeschylus.md" class="wikilink" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> and
"<a   href="Sophocles.md" class="wikilink" title="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> in
the fifth century BC.[^17] Ancient Greece also saw the first Western
instance of anarchy as a philosophical ideal mainly, but not only, by
the Cynics and Stoics. The Cynics
"<a   href="Diogenes_of_Sinope.md" class="wikilink"
title="Diogenes of Sinope">Diogenes of Sinope</a> and
"<a   href="Crates_of_Thebes.md" class="wikilink"
title="Crates of Thebes">Crates of Thebes</a> are both supposed to have
advocated for anarchistic forms of society, although little remains of
their writings. Their most significant contribution was the radical
approach of *nomos* (law) and *physis* (nature). Contrary to the rest of
Greek philosophy, aiming to blend *nomos* and *physis* in harmony,
Cynics dismissed *nomos* (and in consequence: the authorities,
hierarchies, establishments and moral code of polis) while promoting a
way of life, based solely on *physis*.[^18]
"<a   href="Zeno_of_Citium.md" class="wikilink" title="Zeno of Citium">Zeno of
Citium</a>, the founder of Stoicism, who was much influenced by the
Cynics, described his vision of an egalitarian utopian society around
300 BC.[^19] Zeno's *Republic* advocates a form of anarchic society
where there is no need for state structures. He argued that although the
necessary instinct of self-preservation leads humans to egotism, nature
has supplied a corrective to it by providing man with another instinct,
namely sociability. Like many modern anarchists, he believed that if
people follow their instincts, they will have no need of law courts or
police, no temples and no public worship, and use no money—free gifts
taking the place of monetary exchanges.[^20]

"<a   href="Socrates.md" class="wikilink" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>
expressed some views appropriate to anarchism. He constantly questioned
authority and at the centre of his philosophy stood every man's right to
freedom of consciousness.[^21]
"<a   href="Aristippus.md" class="wikilink" title="Aristippus">Aristippus</a>,
a pupil of Socrates and founder of the Hedonistic school, claimed that
he did not wish either to rule or be ruled. He saw the State as a danger
to personal autonomy.[^22] Not all ancient Greeks had anarchic
tendencies. Other philosophers such as
"<a   href="Plato.md" class="wikilink" title="Plato">Plato</a> and
"<a   href="Aristotle.md" class="wikilink" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>
used the term anarchy negatively in association with democracy which
they mistrusted as inherently vulnerable and prone to deteriorate into
tyranny.[^23]

Among the ancient precursors of anarchism are often ignored movements
within ancient Judaism and Early Christianity. As more contemporary
literature shows, anti-state and anti-hierarchy positions can be found
in the Tanakh as well as in New Testament texts.[^24]

### Middle Ages

In Persia during the Middle Ages a Zoroastrian prophet named
"<a   href="Mazdak.md" class="wikilink" title="Mazdak">Mazdak</a>, now
considered a proto-socialist, called for the abolition of private
property, free love and overthrowing the king. He and his thousands of
followers were massacred in 582 CE, but his teaching influenced Islamic
sects in the following centuries.[^25] A theological predecessor to
anarchism developed in Basra and Baghdad among Mu'tazilite ascetics and
Najdiyya Khirijites. This form of revolutionary Islam was not communist
or egalitarian. It did not resemble current concepts of anarchism, but
preached the State was harmful, illegitimate, immoral and
unnecessary.[^26] In Europe, Christianity was overshadowing all aspects
of life. The "<a   href="Brethren_of_the_Free_Spirit.md" class="wikilink"
title="Brethren of the Free Spirit">Brethren of the Free Spirit</a> was
the most notable example of heretic belief that had some vague
anarchistic tendencies. They held anticleric sentiments and believed in
total freedom. Even though most of their ideas were individualistic, the
movement had a social impact, instigating riots and rebellions in Europe
for many years.[^27] Other anarchistic religious movements in Europe
during the Middle Ages included the Hussites and Adamites.[^28]

20th-century historian
"<a   href="James_Joll.md" class="wikilink" title="James Joll">James Joll</a>
described anarchism as two opposing sides. In the Middle Ages, zealotic
and ascetic religious movements emerged, which rejected institutions,
laws and the established order. In the 18th century another anarchist
stream emerged based on rationalism and logic. These two currents of
anarchism later blended to form a contradictory movement that resonated
with a very broad audience.[^29]

### Renaissance and Early Modern Era

With the spread of the Renaissance across Europe, anti-authoritarian and
secular ideas re-emerged. The most prominent thinkers advocating for
liberty, mainly French, were employing utopia in their works to bypass
strict state censorship. In *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (1532-1552),
"<a   href="François_Rabelais.md" class="wikilink"
title="François Rabelais">François Rabelais</a> wrote of the Abby of
Thelema (meaning "will" or "wish"), an imaginary utopia whose motto was
"Do as Thou Will". Around the same time, French law student
"<a   href="Etienne_de_la_Boetie.md" class="wikilink"
title="Etienne de la Boetie">Etienne de la Boetie</a> wrote his
*Discourse on Voluntary Servitude* where he argued that tyranny resulted
from voluntary submission and could be abolished by the people refusing
to obey the authorities above them. Later still in France,
"<a   href="Gabriel_de_Foigny.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gabriel de Foigny">Gabriel de Foigny</a> perceived a utopia with
freedom-loving people without government and no need of religion, as he
wrote in *The Southern Land, Known*. For this, Geneva authorities jailed
de Foigny. "<a   href="François_Fénelon.md" class="wikilink"
title="François Fénelon">François Fénelon</a> also used utopia to
project his political views in the book *Les Aventures de Télémaque*
that infuriated Louis XIV.[^30]

Some Reformation currents (like the radical reformist movement of
Anabaptists) are sometimes credited as the religious forerunners of
modern anarchism. Even though the Reformation was a religious movement
and strengthened the state, it also opened the way for the humanistic
values of the French Revolution.[^31] During the English Civil War,
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a> found one of its
most articulate exponents in
"<a   href="Gerrard_Winstanley.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gerrard Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a>, who was part of the
Diggers movement. He published a pamphlet, *The New Law of
Righteousness*, calling for communal ownership and social and economic
organisation in small agrarian communities. Drawing on the Bible, he
argued that "the blessings of the earth" should "be common to all" and
"none Lord over others".[^32]
"<a   href="William_Blake.md" class="wikilink" title="William Blake">William
Blake</a> has also been said to have espoused an anarchistic political
position.[^33]

In the New World, the first to use the term "anarchy" to mean something
other than chaos was Louis-Armand, Baron de Lahontan in his *Nouveaux
voyages dans l'Amérique septentrionale*, 1703 (*New Voyages in Northern
America*). He described indigenous American society as having no state,
laws, prisons, priests or private property as being in anarchy.[^34]

The Quaker sect, mostly because of their ahierarchical governance and
social relations, based on their beliefs of the divine spirit
universally within all people and humanity's absolute equality, had some
anarchistic tendencies; such values must have influenced
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> the editor and publisher of
the individualist anarchist periodical *Liberty*.[^35]

## Early Anarchism

### Developments of the 18th Century

Modern anarchism grew from the secular and humanistic thought of the
Enlightenment. The scientific discoveries that preceded the
Enlightenment gave thinkers of the time confidence that humans can
reason for themselves. When nature was tamed through science, society
could be set free. The development of anarchism was strongly influenced
by the works of
"<a   href="Jean_Meslier.md" class="wikilink" title="Jean Meslier">Jean
Meslier</a>, "<a   href="Baron_d&#39;Holbach.md" class="wikilink"
title="Baron d&#39;Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a>, whose materialistic
worldview later resonated with anarchists, and
"<a   href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, especially in
his *Discourse on Inequality* and arguments for the moral centrality of
freedom. Rousseau affirmed the goodness in the nature of men and viewed
the state as fundamentally oppressive.
"<a   href="Denis_Diderot.md" class="wikilink" title="Denis Diderot">Denis
Diderot</a>'s *Supplément au voyage de Bougainville* (*The Supplement to
the Voyage of Bougainville*) was also influential.[^36]

The "<a   href="French_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> stands as a landmark in
the history of anarchism. The use of revolutionary violence by masses
would captivate anarchists of later centuries, with such events as the
Women's March on Versailles, the
"<a   href="Storming_of_the_Bastille.md" class="wikilink"
title="Storming of the Bastille">Storming of the Bastille</a> and the
Réveillon riots seen as the revolutionary archetype.[^37] Anarchists
came to identify with the *Enragés* ("enraged ones") who expressed the
demands of the *sans-culottes* ("without breeches"; commoners) who
opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing
the Jacobin dictatorship,
"<a   href="Jean_Varlet.md" class="wikilink" title="Jean Varlet">Jean
Varlet</a> wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are
incompatible, unless the people wish to set its constituted authorities
in permanent insurrection against itself".[^38] In his *Manifeste des
Égaux* (*Manifesto of the Equals*) of 1801,
"<a   href="Sylvain_Maréchal.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sylvain Maréchal">Sylvain Maréchal</a> looked forward to the
disappearance, once and for all, of "the revolting distinction between
rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors
and governed".[^39] The French Revolution came to depict in the minds of
anarchists that as soon as rebels seize power they become the new
tyrants, as evidenced by the state-orchestrated violence of the Reign of
Terror. The proto-anarchist groups of *Enragés* and *sans-culottes* were
ultimately executed by guillotine.[^40]

The debate over the effects of the French Revolution on the anarchist
cause continues to this day. To anarchist historian
"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">Max
Nettlau</a>, the French revolution was a turning point in anarchistic
thought, as it promoted the ideals of "Liberty, Fraternity, and
Equality". Yet he felt that the outcome did nothing more than re-shape
and modernise the militaristic state.[^41] Russian revolutionary and
anarchist thinker
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, however, traced the origins of the anarchist movement
further back, linking it to struggles against authority in feudal
societies and earlier revolutionary traditions.[^42] In a more moderate
approach, independent scholar Sean Sheehan points out that the French
Revolution proved that even the strongest political establishments can
be overthrown.[^43]

"<a   href="William_Godwin.md" class="wikilink" title="William Godwin">William
Godwin</a> in England was the first to develop an expression of modern
anarchist thought.[^44] He is generally regarded as the founder of the
school of thought known as
"<a   href="philosophical_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="philosophical anarchism">philosophical anarchism</a>.[^45] He
argued in *Political Justice* (1793) that government has an inherently
malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and
ignorance. He thought the spread of the use of reason to the masses
would eventually cause the government to wither away as an unnecessary
force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he
was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing a government
from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process
of peaceful evolution.[^46] His aversion to the imposition of a
rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the
people's "mental enslavement", the foundations of law, property rights
and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic
foundations of society as constraining the natural development of
individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually
beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and
its institutions are shown to constrain the development of one's
capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of
private judgement.[^47]

### Proudhon and Stirner

Frenchman "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> is regarded as
the founder of modern anarchism, a label he adopted in his
groundbreaking work *What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle
of Right and Government* published in 1840. In it he asks "What is
property?", a question that he answers with the famous accusation
""<a   href="Property_is_theft.md" class="wikilink"
title="Property is theft">Property is theft</a>".[^48] Proudhon's theory
of "<a   href="mutualism.md" class="wikilink" title="mutualism">mutualism</a>
rejects the state, capitalism, and communism.[^49] It calls for a
co-operative society in which the free associations of individuals are
linked in a decentralised federation based on a "Bank of the People"
that supplies workers with free credit.[^50] He contrasted this with
what he called "possession", or limited ownership of resources and goods
only while in more or less continuous use. Later, Proudhon also added
that "Property is liberty" and argued that it was a bulwark against
state power.[^51]

Mutualists would later play an important role in the First
International, especially at the first two Congresses held in Geneva and
Lausanne, but diminished in European influence with the rise of
anarcho-communism. Instead, Mutualism would find fertile ground among
American individualists in the late 19th century.[^52]

In Spain, "<a   href="Ramón_de_la_Sagra.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ramón de la Sagra">Ramón de la Sagra</a> established the
anarchist journal *El Porvenir* in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired
by Proudhon's ideas.[^53] Catalan politician
"<a   href="Francesc_Pi_i_Margall.md" class="wikilink"
title="Francesc Pi i Margall">Francesc Pi i Margall</a> became the
principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish.[^54] He would
later briefly become president of Spain in 1873 while leader of the
Democratic Republican Federal Party,[^55] where he tried to implement
some of Proudhon's ideas.[^56]

An influential form of
"<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> called
egoism or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and
best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, German philosopher
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">Max
Stirner</a>.[^57] Stirner's *The Ego and Its Own* (also translated as
*The Individual and his Property* or *The Unique and His Property*),
published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.[^58] Stirner
was critical of capitalism as it creates class warfare where the rich
will exploit the poor, using the state as its tool.[^59] He also
rejected religions, communism and liberalism, as all of them subordinate
individuals to God, a collective, or the state.[^60] According to
Stirner the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their
power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or
morality.[^61] He held that society does not exist, but "the individuals
are its reality".[^62] Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw
unions of egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by
all parties' support through an act of will, which proposed as a form of
organisation in place of the state.[^63] Egoist anarchists claimed that
egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between
individuals.[^64] Stirner was proposing an individual rebellion, which
would not seek to establish new institutions nor anything resembling a
state.[^65]

### Revolutions of 1848

Europe was shocked by another revolutionary wave in 1848 which started
once again in Paris. The new government, consisting mostly of Jacobins,
was backed by the working class but failed to implement meaningful
reforms. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Russian revolutionary
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> were involved in the events
of 1848. The failure of the revolution shaped Proudhon's views. He
became convinced that a revolution should aim to destroy authority, not
grasp power. He saw capitalism as the root of social problems and
government, using political tools only, as incapable of confronting the
real issues.[^66] The course of events of 1848, radicalised Bakunin who,
due to the failure of the revolutions, lost his confidence in any kind
of reform.[^67]

Other anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution in France include
"<a   href="Anselme_Bellegarrigue.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anselme Bellegarrigue">Anselme Bellegarrigue</a>, Ernest
Coeurderoy and the early anarcho-communist
"<a   href="Joseph_Déjacque.md" class="wikilink"
title="Joseph Déjacque">Joseph Déjacque</a>, who was the first person to
call himself a libertarian.[^68] Unlike Proudhon, Déjacque argued that
"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right
to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their
nature".[^69] Déjacque was also a critic of Proudhon's mutualist theory
and anti-feminist views.[^70] Returning to New York, he was able to
serialise his book in his periodical *Le Libertaire, Journal du
Mouvement social*.[^71] The French anarchist movement, though
self-described as "mutualists", started gaining pace during 1860s as
workers' associations began to form.[^72]

## Classical Anarchism

The decades of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries constitute the
belle époque of anarchist history.[^73] In this "classical" era, roughly
defined as the period between the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Spanish
Civil War of 1936 to 1939[^74] (or the 1840s/1860s through 1939),
anarchism played a prominent role in working-class struggles (alongside
Marxism) in Europe as well as in the Americas, Asia, and Oceania.[^75]
Modernism, mass migration, railroads and access to printing all helped
anarchists to advance their causes.[^76]

### First International and Paris Commune

In 1864, the creation of the
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA, also called the "First
International") united diverse revolutionary currents - including
socialist Marxists, trade unionists, communists and anarchists.[^77]
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, a
leading figure of the International, became a member of its General
Council.[^78]

Four years later, in 1868, Mikhail Bakunin joined the First
International with his "<a   href="collectivist_anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist anarchist">collectivist anarchist</a> associates.
They advocated the collectivisation of property and the revolutionary
overthrow of the state.[^79] Bakunin corresponded with other members of
the International, seeking to establish a loose brotherhood of
revolutionaries who would ensure that the coming revolution would not
take an authoritarian course, in sharp contrast with other currents that
were seeking to get a firm grasp on state power. Bakunin's energy and
writings about a great variety of subjects, such as education and gender
equality, helped to increase his influence within the IWA. His main line
was that the International should try to promote a revolution without
aiming to create a mere government of "experts". Workers should seek to
emancipate their class with direct actions, using cooperatives, mutual
credit, and strikes, but avoid participation in bourgeois politics.[^80]
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First
International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently,
the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin
as their respective figureheads.[^81] Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas
as centralist. Because of this, he predicted that if a Marxist party
came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling
class they had fought against.[^82] Followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon,
the mutualists, also opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating
political abstentionism and small property holdings.[^83]

Meanwhile, an uprising after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871 led
to the formation of the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> in March 1871. Anarchists had a prominent role in the
Commune,[^84] next to Blanquists and - to a lesser extent - Marxists.
The uprising was greatly influenced by anarchists and had a great impact
on anarchist history.[^85] Radical socialist views, like Proudhonian
federalism, were implemented to a small extent. Most importantly, the
workers proved they could run their own services and factories. After
the defeat of the Commune, anarchists like
"<a   href="Eugène_Varlin.md" class="wikilink" title="Eugène Varlin">Eugène
Varlin</a>,
"<a   href="Louise_Michel.md" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
Michel</a>, and
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">Élisée
Reclus</a> were shot or imprisoned.[^86] The French Third Republic
persecuted socialist supporters for a decade. Leading members of the
International who survived the bloody suppression of the Commune fled to
Switzerland, where the Anarchist St. Imier International would form in
1872.[^87] In 1872, the conflict between Marxists and anarchists
climaxed. Marx had, since 1871, proposed the creation of a political
party, which anarchists found to be an appalling and unacceptable
prospect. Various groups (including Italian sections, the Belgian
Federation and the Jura Federation) rejected Marx's proposition at the
1872 Hague Congress. They saw it as an attempt to create state socialism
that would ultimately fail to emancipate humanity. In contrast, they
proposed political struggle through social revolution.[^88] Finally,
anarchists were expelled from the First International. In response, the
federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier
Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.[^89]

### Emergence of Anarcho-Communism

"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communism">Anarcho-communism</a> developed out of radical
socialist currents after the 1789 French Revolution but was first
formulated as such in the Italian section of the First
International.[^90] It was the convincing critique of
"<a   href="Carlo_Cafiero.md" class="wikilink" title="Carlo Cafiero">Carlo
Cafiero</a> and "<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> that paved the way for
anarcho-communism to surpass collectivism; they argued that collectivism
would inevitably end in competition and inequality.[^91] Essayist Alain
Pengam comments that between 1880 and 1890 the perspective of a
revolution was thought to be closed. Anarcho-communists had
anti-organisational tendencies, opposed political and trade-union
struggles (such as the eight-hour day) as being overly reformist, and in
some cases favoured acts of terrorism.[^92] Finding themselves
increasingly isolated, they opted to join the workers' movements after
1890.[^93]

With the aid of Peter Kropotkin's optimism and persuasive writing,
anarcho-communism became the major anarchist current in Europe and
abroad—except in Spain where anarcho-syndicalism prevailed.[^94] The
theoretical work of Kropotkin and Malatesta grew in importance later as
it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary
anti-organisationalist sections.[^95] Kropotkin elaborated on the theory
behind the revolution of anarcho-communism saying, "it is the risen
people who are the real agent and not the working class organised in the
enterprise (the cells of the capitalist mode of production) and seeking
to assert itself as labour power, as a more 'rational' industrial body
or social brain (manager) than the employers".[^96]

### Organised Labour and Syndicalism

Due to a high influx of European immigrants, Chicago was the centre of
the American anarchist movement during the 19th century. On 1 May 1886,
a general strike was called in several United States cities with the
demand of an eight-hour work day, and anarchists allied themselves with
the workers' movement despite seeing the objective as reformist.[^97] On
May 3, a fight broke out in Chicago when strikebreakers attempted to
cross the picket line. Two workers died when police opened fire on the
crowd.[^98] The next day anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's
Haymarket Square.[^99] A bomb was thrown from a side alley.[^100] In the
ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other.[^101]
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.[^102] Eight
anarchists, directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the
rally, were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased
officers. They became international political celebrities in the labour
movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide
before his execution. The incident became known as the
"<a   href="Haymarket_affair.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket affair">Haymarket affair</a> and was a setback for the
movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second
attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the
eight-hour day was made. It had the secondary purpose of memorialising
those workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.[^103] Although
it had initially been conceived as a one-off event, by the following
year the commemoration of International Workers' Day on May Day had
become firmly established as an international workers' holiday.[^104]

Syndicalism saw its heights from 1894 to 1914, with roots reaching back
to 19th century labour movements and the trade unionists of the First
International.[^105] Subsequently, anarcho-syndicalism's main tenet that
economic struggles come before political ones can be traced back to
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and was the same issue that led to the schism of
the First International.[^106] Anarcho-syndicalists advocated that
labour syndicates should focus not only on the conditions and wages of
workers but also on revolutionary objectives.[^107]

The French "<a   href="Confédération_Générale_du_Travail.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confédération Générale du Travail">Confédération Générale du
Travail</a> (General Confederation of Labour) was one of Europe's most
prominent syndicalist organisations and, while rejecting illegalism, was
heavily influenced by anarchism.[^108] As a grassroots organisation and
lab for revolutionary ideas, its structure was exported to other
like-minded European organisations. The organisation would later take a
reformist path after 1914.[^109]

In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered
delegates from most European countries, the United States, Japan and
Latin America.[^110] A central debate concerned the relation between
anarchism and trade unionism.[^111] Errico Malatesta and
"<a   href="Pierre_Monatte.md" class="wikilink" title="Pierre Monatte">Pierre
Monatte</a> strongly disagreed on this issue. Monatte thought that
syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions for a
social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by
itself sufficient.[^112] He thought the trade-union movement was
reformist and even conservative, citing the phenomenon of professional
union officials as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker. Malatesta
warned that the syndicalist aims were of perpetuating syndicalism
itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end goal
and consequently must refrain from committing to any particular method
of achieving it.[^113]

In Spain, syndicalism had grown significantly during the 1880s but the
first anarchist related organisations didn't flourish. In 1910 however,
the "<a   href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour or CNT) was founded and
gradually became entwined with anarchism.[^114] The CNT was affiliated
with the International Workers' Association, a federation of
anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922.[^115] The success of
the CNT stimulated the spread of anarcho-syndicalism in Latin America.
The Federación Obrera Regional Argentina (Argentine Regional Workers'
Federation) reached a quarter of a million members, surpassing social
democratic unions.[^116]

By the early 20th century, revolutionary syndicalism had spread across
the world, from Latin America to Eastern Europe and Asia, with most of
its activity then taking place outside of Western Europe.[^117]

### Propaganda of the Deed

The use of revolutionary political violence, known as
"<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>, was employed
by a small but influential part of the anarchist movement over a roughly
four decade period, beginning in the 1880s.[^118] It was conceived as a
form of insurrectionary action used to provoke and inspire the masses to
revolution.[^119] This was at a time when anarchists were persecuted and
revolutionaries were becoming more isolated.[^120] The dismemberment of
the French socialist movement and, following the suppression of the 1871
Paris Commune, the execution or the exile of many communards to penal
colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts.[^121] But
the prime factor in the rise of propaganda of the deed, as historian
Constance Bantman outlines, was the writings of Russian revolutionaries
between 1869 and 1891, namely of Mikhail Bakunin and
"<a   href="Sergei_Nechaev.md" class="wikilink" title="Sergei Nechaev">Sergei
Nechaev</a> who developed significant insurrectionary strategies.[^122]

"<a   href="Paul_Brousse.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Brousse">Paul
Brousse</a>, a medical doctor and active militant of violent
insurrection, popularised the actions of propaganda of the deed.[^123]
In the United States,
"<a   href="Johann_Most.md" class="wikilink" title="Johann Most">Johann
Most</a> advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against
counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for
itself, but also action as propaganda".[^124] Russian
anarchist-communists employed terrorism and illegal acts in their
struggle.[^125] Numerous heads of state were assassinated or attacked by
members of the anarchist movement.[^126] In 1901, the Polish-American
anarchist
"<a   href="Leon_Czolgosz.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Czolgosz">Leon
Czolgosz</a> assassinated the president of the United States,
"<a   href="William_McKinley.md" class="wikilink"
title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a>.
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, who was erroneously suspected of being involved, expressed
some sympathy for Czolgosz and incurred a great deal of negative
publicity.[^127] Goldman also supported
"<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> in his failed
assassination attempt of steel industrialist Henry Frick in the wake of
the Homestead Strike, and she wrote about how these small acts of
violence were incomparable to the deluge of violence regularly committed
by the state and capital.[^128] In Europe, a wave of illegalism (the
embracement of a criminal way of life) spread throughout the anarchist
movement, with
"<a   href="Marius_Jacob.md" class="wikilink" title="Marius Jacob">Marius
Jacob</a>,
"<a   href="Ravachol.md" class="wikilink" title="Ravachol">Ravachol</a>,
intellectual Émile Henry and the
"<a   href="Bonnot_Gang.md" class="wikilink" title="Bonnot Gang">Bonnot
Gang</a> being notable examples. The Bonnot Gang in particular justified
illegal and violent behavior by claiming that they were "taking back"
property that did not rightfully belong to capitalists.[^129] In Russia,
Narodnaya Volya ("People's Will" which was not an anarchist organisation
but nevertheless drew inspiration from Bakunin's work), assassinated
Tsar Alexander II in 1881 and gained some popular support. However, for
the most part, the anarchist movement in Russia remained marginal in the
following years.[^130] In the Ottoman Empire, the Boatmen of
Thessaloniki were a Bulgarian anarchist revolutionary organisation
active 1898-1903.

As early as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced
themselves from both illegalism and propaganda of the deed. Peter
Kropotkin, for example, wrote in *Le Révolté* that "a structure based on
centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of
dynamite".[^131] State repression of the anarchist and labour movements,
including the infamous 1894 French *lois scélérates* ("villainous
laws"), following a number of successful bombings and assassinations may
have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although
state repression may have played an equal role in their adoption.[^132]
Early proponents of propaganda of the deed, like Alexander Berkman,
started to question the legitimacy of violence as a tactic. A variety of
anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour
of collective revolutionary action through the trade union
movement.[^133]

By the end of the 19th century, it became clear that propaganda of the
deed was not going to spark a revolution. Though it was employed by only
a minority of anarchists, it gave anarchism a violent reputation and it
isolated anarchists from broader social movements.[^134] It was
abandoned by the majority of the anarchist movement in the early 20th
century.[^135]

### Revolutionary Wave

Anarchists were involved in the Strandzha Commune and Krusevo Republic
established in Macedonia in Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising of 1903, and
in the "<a   href="Mexican_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> of 1910. The
revolutionary wave of 1917–23 saw varying degrees of active
participation by anarchists.[^136] Following the failed 1905 Russian
Revolution, anarchists participated again in both the February and
October revolutions of 1917 and were initially enthusiastic about the
Bolshevik cause.[^137] Prior to the revolution, Lenin had won over
anarchists and syndicalists with high praises in his 1917 work *The
State and Revolution*.[^138] However, anarchist objections quickly
arose. They opposed, for example, the slogan, "All power to the
Soviet".[^139] The dictatorship of the proletariat was incompatible with
the libertarian views of the anarchists, and co-operation shortly ended
as the Bolsheviks soon turned against anarchists and other left-wing
opposition.[^140] After their grasp on power was stabilized, the
Bolsheviks crushed the anarchists.[^141] Anarchists in central Russia
were either imprisoned, driven underground, or joined the victorious
Bolsheviks. Anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine.[^142]
There, the "<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">Makhnovshchina</a> established an autonomous
region of four hundred square miles with a population of approximately
seven million. Anarchists who had fought in the Russian Civil War at
first against the anti-Bolshevik White Army now also fought the Red
Army, Ukrainian People's Army, and the German and Austrian forces who
fought under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.[^143] This conflict culminated
in the 1921 "<a   href="Kronstadt_rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, a garrison in
Kronstadt where Baltic Fleet sailors and citizens made demands for
reforms. The new government suppressed the rebellion.[^144] The
Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, led by
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a>, continued to fight until August 1921 when it was crushed by
the state only months after the Kronstadt rebellion.[^145]

Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been deported from the U.S.
in 1917, were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy
and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote accounts of
their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of state control the
Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Mikhail Bakunin's predictions on the
consequences of Marxist rule, that the leaders of the new socialist
state would become the new ruling class, had proven true.[^146] In 1920,
Peter Kropotkin published a *Message to the Workers of the West*
explaining the false path of state socialism was doomed to fail.[^147]
Disappointed with the course of events, Goldman and Berkman fled the
USSR in 1921, the same year Kropotkin died. By 1925, anarchism was
banned under the Bolshevik regime.[^148] The victory of the Bolsheviks
in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did
serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and
activists saw the Bolsheviks' success as setting an example, and
communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist
movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the
major syndicalist movements of the Confédération Générale du Travail
(General Confederation of Labour) and Industrial Workers of the World
left these organisations to join the Communist International.[^149]

From the collapse of anarchism in the newly formed Soviet Union, two
anarchist trends arose. The first,
"<a   href="platformism.md" class="wikilink"
title="platformism">platformism</a>, was propagated in the anarchist
journal *Dielo Truda* by a group of Russian exiles, including Nestor
Makhno. Their main objective, as proponent Piotr Arsinov wrote, was to
create a non-hierarchical party that would offer "common organisation of
our forces on a basis of collective responsibility and collective
methods of action".[^150] They considered that a lack of organisation
was a basic reason of why anarchism had failed. Platformism had the
purpose of providing a strategy for class struggle, as Bakunin and
Kropotkin had suggested before.[^151] The other trend emerged as an
organisational alternative to platformism, since it had similarities to
party structure. Anarchist intellectual
"<a   href="Volin.md" class="wikilink" title="Volin">Volin</a> was one of the
most notable opponents of platformism, and he pointed toward to what is
today known as "<a   href="synthesis_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="synthesis anarchism">synthesis anarchism</a>.[^152]

During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, anarchists
"<a   href="Gustav_Landauer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gustav Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a> and
"<a   href="Erich_Mühsam.md" class="wikilink" title="Erich Mühsam">Erich
Mühsam</a> took important leadership positions within the revolutionary
councilist structures of the Bavarian Soviet Republic.[^153] In Italy,
the syndicalist trade union Unione Sindacale Italiana (Italian
Syndicalist Union), had half a million members. It played a prominent
role in events known as the *Biennio Rosso* ("Two Red Years") and
*Settimana Rossa* ("Red Week"). In the latter, the monarchy was almost
overthrown.[^154]

In Mexico, the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the
early 1910s it conducted a series of military offensives, leading to the
conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja
California. Under the leadership of anarcho-communist
"<a   href="Ricardo_Flores_Magón.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ricardo Flores Magón">Ricardo Flores Magón</a>, its slogan was
*Tierra y Libertad* ('Land and Liberty').[^155] Magón's journal
*Regeneración* ('Regeneration') had a significant circulation, and he
helped urban workers turn to anarcho-syndicalism. He also influenced the
Zapata movement.[^156]

Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two insurrectionary
anarchists and Italian migrants to the United States, were convicted of
involvement in an armed robbery and the murders of two people in 1920.
After a controversial trial and a series of appeals they were sentenced
to death and executed on 23 August 1927.[^157] Following their deaths,
critical opinion overwhelmingly held that the two men were convicted
largely because of their anarchist political beliefs and were unjustly
executed.[^158] After the Sacco and Vanzetti case, and despite worldwide
protests and mainstream media headlines, the anarchist movement faded in
the United States.[^159]

### Rise of Fascism

Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Italian
anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation *Arditi
del Popolo* (The People's Daring Ones or AdP), which was strongest in
areas with anarchist traditions. They achieved some success in their
activism, such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of
Parma in August 1922.[^160] AdP saw growth after the Socialist Party
signed the pacification pact with the fascists.[^161] AdP consisted of
militant proletarians, anarchists, communists and even socialists. It
numbered twenty-thousand members in 144 sections.[^162] The veteran
Italian anarchist,
"<a   href="Luigi_Fabbri.md" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Fabbri">Luigi
Fabbri</a>, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism,
describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution".[^163] Italian
anarchists
"<a   href="Gino_Lucetti.md" class="wikilink" title="Gino Lucetti">Gino
Lucetti</a> and
"<a   href="Anteo_Zamboni.md" class="wikilink" title="Anteo Zamboni">Anteo
Zamboni</a> narrowly failed an assassination attempt against Benito
Mussolini. Italian anarchists formed various partisan groups during
World War II.[^164]

In France, where the far-right leagues came close to insurrection in the
February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a united front policy. One
tendency was for the creation of a pack with political parties while
others objected.[^165] In Spain, the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo
(National Confederation of Labour or CNT) initially refused to join a
popular front electoral alliance. Abstention by their supporters led to
a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and
anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months
later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing
the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).[^166] In response to the army
rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers,
supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and large areas
of rural Spain where they collectivised the land.[^167] However, even
before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in
a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution
of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union.
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both
dissident Marxists and anarchists.[^168]

In Germany, the Nazis crushed anarchism upon seizing power.[^169] Apart
from Spain, nowhere else could the anarchist movement provide a solid
resistance to various fascist regimes throughout Europe.[^170]

### Spanish Revolution

The "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a> was
the first and only time that libertarian socialism became an imminent
reality. It stood on the ground of a strong anarchist movement in Spain
that dated back to the 19th century. Anarchist groups enjoyed broad
social support particularly in Barcelona, Aragon, Andalusia, Levante.
Anarchism in Spain leaned towards syndicalism and this yielded to the
formation of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) in 1910.[^171]
The CNT declared that its aim was a libertarian communist society and
was organising strikes all over Spain.[^172] The Federación Anarquista
Ibérica (FAI) was founded later to keep CNT on a *pure* anarchist path
amidst dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera's crackdown on labour
movements.[^173] The Second Spanish Republic was pronounced in 1931 and
brought to power a Republican–Socialist alliance. But instead of the
high hopes of the CNT (mostly among *gradualists*) and others, the
repression of the labour movement continued. FAI gained more control of
CNT.[^174]

In 1936, the Popular Front (an electoral alliance dominated by
left-wingers) won the elections and months later the former ruling class
responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War
(1936–1939).[^175] In response to the army rebellion, an
anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed
militias, took control of urban and large areas of rural Spain where
they collectivised the land.[^176] Barcelona was the site of the most
dramatic change, as workers broke bourgeois habits and even gender
hierarchies. Newly formed anarcho-feminist group
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a> (Free Women) had an active role in the social transformation
in Barcelona. This rebellious culture impressed visitors such as
"<a   href="George_Orwell.md" class="wikilink" title="George Orwell">George
Orwell</a>. Enterprises and farms were collectivised, and working
conditions improved drastically. In rural Aragon money was abolished and
the economy was collectivised.[^177] Villages were run by popular
assemblies in a direct democratic fashion, without coercing individuals
to join.[^178] Anarchist militia columns, fighting without martial
discipline or military rank, despite shortages in military materials,
made significant gains at the war front.[^179]

Anarchists of CNT-FAI faced a major dilemma after the coup had failed in
July 1936: either continue their fight against the state or join the
anti-fascist left-wing parties and form a government. They opted for the
latter and by November 1936, four members of CNT-FAI became ministers in
the government of the former trade unionist Francisco Largo Caballero.
This was justified by CNT-FAI as a historical necessity since war was
being waged, but other prominent anarchists disagreed, both on principle
and as a tactical move.[^180] In November 1936 the prominent
anarcho-feminist "<a   href="Federica_Montseny.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federica Montseny">Federica Montseny</a> was installed as
minister of Health—the first woman in Spanish history to become a
cabinet minister.[^181]

During the course of the events of the Spanish Revolution, anarchists
were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists of the
Spanish Communist Party, who controlled the distribution of military aid
to the Republicans received from the Soviet Union.[^182] Stalinist-led
troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists
and anarchists.[^183] The fight among anarchists and communists
escalated during the May Days, as the Soviet Union sought to control the
Republicans.[^184]

The 1939 defeat of Republican Spain marked the end of anarchism's
classical period.[^185] In light of continual anarchist defeats, one can
argue about the naivety of 19th-century anarchist thinking—the
establishment of state and capitalism was too strong to be destroyed.
According to political philosophy professor Ruth Kinna and lecturer Alex
Prichard, it is uncertain whether these defeats were the result of a
functional error within the anarchist theories, as New Left
intellectuals suggested some decades later, or the social context that
prevented the anarchists from fulfilling their ambitions. What is
certain, though, is that their critique of state and capitalism
ultimately proved right, as the world was marching towards
totalitarianism and fascism.[^186]

### Anarchism in the Colonial World

As empires and capitalism were expanding at the turn of the century, so
was anarchism which soon flourished in Latin America, East Asia, South
Africa and Australia.[^187]

Anarchism found fertile ground in Asia and was the most vibrant ideology
among other socialist currents during the first decades of 20th century.
The works of European philosophers, especially Kropotkin's, were popular
among revolutionary youth. Intellectuals tried to link anarchism to
earlier philosophical currents in Asia, like Taoism, Buddhism and
neo-Confucianism. But the factor that contributed most to the rise of
anarchism was industrialisation and the new capitalistic era that
eastern Asia was entering.[^188] Young Chinese anarchists in the early
days of the 20th century voiced the cause of revolutionary
anarcho-communism along with humanism, belief in science and
universalism in the journal *Hsin Shih-chi*. Anarchism was growing in
influence until the mid-1920s when Bolshevik successes seemed to
indicate the way to communism.[^189] Likewise in Japan,
anarcho-communists such as
"<a   href="Kōtoku_Shūsui.md" class="wikilink" title="Kōtoku Shūsui">Kōtoku
Shūsui</a>,
"<a   href="Osugi_Sakae.md" class="wikilink" title="Osugi Sakae">Osugi
Sakae</a> and
"<a   href="Hatta_Shuzo.md" class="wikilink" title="Hatta Shuzo">Hatta
Shuzo</a> were inspired by the works of westerners philosophers and
opposed capitalism and the state. Shuzo created the school of "pure
anarchism". Because of the industrial growth, anarcho-syndicalism also
arose for a brief period, before communists prevailed among
workers.[^190] Tokyo had been a hotspot for anarchist and revolutionary
ideas which were circulating among Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese
students who travelled to Japan to study. Socialists by then were
enthusiastically supporting the idea of "social revolution" and
anarchists were in full support of it.[^191] In Korea, anarchism took a
different course. Korea was under Japanese rule from 1910 to 1945 and in
the early phases of that period, anarchists took part in national
resistance, forming an anarchist zone in Shinmin Manchuria from 1928 to
1931. "<a   href="Kim_Chwa-chin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kim Chwa-chin">Kim
Chwa-chin</a> was a prominent figure of the movement.[^192] In India,
anarchism did not thrive, partly because of its reputation for being
violent. The fragile anarchist movement developed in India was more
non-statist, rather than anti-statist.[^193]

Anarchism travelled to the Eastern Mediterranean along with other
radical secular ideas in the cosmopolitan Ottoman Empire. Under the
spell of Errico Malatesta, a group of Egyptian anarchists imported
anarchism to Alexandria. It was in a transitional stage during that era,
as industrialisation and urbanisation were transforming Egypt. Anarchist
activity was spread along with other radical secular ideas within the
Islamic Empire.[^194] In Africa, anarchism appeared from within the
continent. A large part of African society, mainly rural, was founded on
African communalism which was mostly egalitarian. It had some anarchist
elements, without class divisions, formal hierarchies and access to the
means of production by all members of the localities. African
Communalism was far from being an ideal anarchist society. Gender
privileges were apparent, feudalism and slavery did exist in a few areas
but not on a mass scale.[^195]

Anarchism travelled to Latin America through European immigrants. The
most impressive presence was in Buenos Aires, but Havana, Lima,
Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, São Paulo as well saw the growth of
anarchist pockets. Anarchists had a much larger impact on trade unions
than their authoritarian left counterparts.[^196] In Argentina, Uruguay
and Brazil, a strong anarcho-syndicalist current was formed—partly
because of the rapid industrialisation of these countries. In 1905,
anarchists took control of the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation
(FORA) in Argentina, overshadowing social democrats. Likewise, in
Uruguay, FORU was created by anarchists in 1905. These syndicates
organised a series of general strikes in the following years. After this
the success of the Bolsheviks, anarchism gradually declined in these
three countries which had been the strongholds of anarchism in Latin
America.[^197] It is worth noting that the notion of imported anarchism
in Latin America has been challenged, as slave rebellions appeared in
Latin America before the arrival of European anarchists.[^198]

Anarchists became involved in the anti-colonial national-independence
struggles of the early 20th century. Anarchism inspired
anti-authoritarian and egalitarian ideals among national independence
movements, challenging the nationalistic tendencies of many national
liberation movements.[^199]

## Individualist Anarchism

### In the United States

American anarchism has its roots in religious groups that fled Europe to
escape religious persecution during the 17th century. It sprouted
towards individual anarchism as distrust of government was widespread in
North America during the next centuries. In sharp contrast with their
European counterparts, according to the scholar Marshall, American
anarchism was leaning towards individualism and was mainly
pro-capitalist, hence described as right-wing libertarianism; however
Marshall later stated that capitalism and anarchism are incompatible and
American anarchists like Tucker and Spooner were left
libertarians.[^200] The scholar Martin stated the American anarchists
were mutualist anarchists in support of the labor theory of value.[^201]
American anarchist justified private property as the safeguard of
personal autonomy.[^202] "<a   href="Henry_David_Thoreau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Henry David Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> was an important
early influence on individualist anarchist thought in the United States
in the mid 19th century. He was skeptical towards government—in his work
*Civil Disobedience* he declared that *"That government is best which
governs least"*. He has frequently been cited as an
anarcho-individualist, even though he was never rebellious.[^203]
"<a   href="Josiah_Warren.md" class="wikilink" title="Josiah Warren">Josiah
Warren</a> was, at the late 19th century, a prominent advocate of a
variant of mutualism called equitable commerce, a fair trade system
where the price of a product is based on labor effort instead of the
cost of manufacturing.[^204] "<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>, also influenced by
Proudhon, was the editor of the prominent anarchist journal *Liberty*
and a proponent of individualism.[^205]

In the shade of individualism, there was also anarcho-Christianism as
well as some socialist pockets, especially in Chicago.[^206] It was
after Chicago's bloody protests in 1886 when the anarchist movement
became known nationwide. But anarchism quickly declined when it was
associated with terrorist violence.[^207]

An important concern for American individualist anarchism was
"<a   href="free_love.md" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>.
Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws
discriminated against women, for example, marriage laws and anti-birth
control measures.[^208] Openly bisexual radical
"<a   href="Edna_St._Vincent_Millay.md" class="wikilink"
title="Edna St. Vincent Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> and lesbian
anarchist Margaret Anderson were prominent among them. Discussion groups
organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among
others.[^209]

A heated debate among American individualist anarchists of that era was
the *natural rights* versus egoistic approaches. Proponents of naturals
rights claimed that without them brutality would prevail, while egoists
were proposing that there is no such right, it only restricted the
individual. Benjamin Tucker, who tried to determine a scientific base
for moral right or wrong, ultimately sided with the latter.[^210]

The Modern Schools, also called Ferrer Schools, were schools established
in the United States in the early 20th century. They were modelled after
the Escuela Moderna of "<a   href="Francisco_Ferrer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Francisco Ferrer">Francisco Ferrer</a>, the Catalan educator and
anarchist. They were an important part of the anarchist, free schooling,
socialist, and labour movements in the United States intending to
educate the working classes from a secular, class-conscious perspective.
The Modern Schools imparted daytime academic classes for children and
nighttime continuing-education lectures for adults. The first and most
notable of the Modern Schools was opened in New York City in 1911.
Commonly called the Ferrer Center, it was founded by notable
anarchists—including Leonard Abbott, Alexander Berkman,
"<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> and Emma
Goldman.[^211] The school used Montessori methods and equipment, and
emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling
and arithmetic.[^212]

### In Europe and the Arts

European individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by
William Godwin and Max Stirner.[^213] Many artists, poets and writers
interested in freedom were exploring different aspects of
anarchism.[^214] Anarcho-individualists were more interested in personal
development, challenging the social norms and demanding sexual freedom
rather than engaging in social struggles.[^215]

In France, an artistic and individualist trend in anarchism was shaping
a new cultural movement at the turn of the century, with less of a
social component and more of a personal rebellion against norms.[^216]
Impressionists and neo-Impressionist painters were attracted by
anarchism, most notably French
"<a   href="Camille_Pissarro.md" class="wikilink"
title="Camille Pissarro">Camille Pissarro</a>.[^217] Modernist writers
having anarchist tendencies, such as
"<a   href="Henrik_Ibsen.md" class="wikilink" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik
Ibsen</a> and
"<a   href="James_Joyce.md" class="wikilink" title="James Joyce">James
Joyce</a>, led to the impression that "modernism itself can be
understood as the aesthetic realisation of anarchist politics".[^218]
Dadaism arose from individualists aiming to use art to achieve *total
freedom*. It influenced other currents such as surrealism, and
proponents played a significant role in the Berlin rising of 1918.[^219]
One of the main individualist anarchist journals in France,
*L'Anarchie*, was established in 1905.[^220] A notable individualist was
Stirnerist
"<a   href="Émile_Armand.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Armand">Émile
Armand</a> who was a defender of polyamory and homosexuality.[^221]

## Post-War

Following the end of the Spanish Civil War and World War II, the
anarchist movement was a "ghost" of its former self, as proclaimed by
anarchist historian George Woodcock.[^222] In his work *Anarchism: A
History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements* published 1962, he wrote
that after 1936 it was "a ghost that inspires neither fear among
governments nor hope among peoples nor even interest among
newspapermen".[^223] Capitalism continued to grow throughout the
post-war period despite predictions from Marxist scholars that it would
soon collapse under its own contradictions, yet anarchism gained a
surprising surge in popular interest during the 1960s. Reasons for this
were believed to be the gradual demystification of the Soviet Union and
tensions at the climax of the Cold War.[^224] The New Left, which arose
in the 1950s, was a libertarian socialist movement that was closer to
anarchism. Prominent thinkers such as
"<a   href="Herbert_Marcuse.md" class="wikilink"
title="Herbert Marcuse">Herbert Marcuse</a> and Wright Mills were
critical of United States and Soviet Marxism.[^225]

In France, a wave of protests and demonstrations confronted the
right-wing government of Charles de Gaulle in May 1968. Even though the
anarchists had a minimal role, the events of May had a significant
impact on anarchism.[^226] There were huge demonstrations with crowds in
some places reaching one million participants. Strikes were called in
many major cities and towns involving seven million workers—all
grassroots, bottom-up and spontaneously organised.[^227] Various
committees were formed at universities, lyceums, and in neighbourhoods,
mostly having anti-authoritarian tendencies.[^228] Slogans that
resonated with libertarian ideas were prominent such as: "I take my
desires for reality, because I believe in the reality of my
desires."[^229] Even though the spirit of the events leaned mostly
towards libertarian communism, some authors draw a connection to
anarchism.[^230] The wave of protests eased when a 10% pay raise was
granted and national elections were proclaimed. The paving stones of
Paris were only covering some reformist victories.[^231] Nevertheless,
the 1968 events inspired a new confidence in anarchism as workers'
management, self-determination, grassroots democracy,
antiauthoritarianism, and spontaneity became relevant once more. After
decades of pessimism 1968 marked the revival of anarchism, either as a
distinct ideology or as a part of other social movements.[^232]

Originally founded in 1957, The Situationist International rose to
prominence during events of 1968 with the principal argument that life
had turned into a "spectacle" because of the corrosive effect of
capitalism.[^233] They later dissolved in 1972.[^234] The late 1960s saw
the flourish of "<a   href="anarcha-feminism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>. It attacked the state,
capitalism and patriarchy and was organized in a decentralised
manner.[^235]
"<a   href="Black_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Black anarchism">Black
anarchism</a> began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's
move from a Eurocentric demographic.[^236]

As the ecological crisis was becoming a greater threat to the planet,
Murray Bookchin developed a new wave of anarchist thought. In his social
ecology theory, he argues that certain social practices and priorities
threaten life on Earth. He goes further to identify the cause of such
practises as social oppressions. He proposed libertarian municipalism,
the involvement of people in political struggles in decentralized
federated villages or towns.[^237]

### Contemporary Anarchism

The anthropology of anarchism has changed in the contemporary era as the
traditional lines or ideas of the 19th century have been abandoned. Most
anarchists are now younger activists informed with feminist and
ecological concerns. They are involved in counterculture, Black Power,
creating temporary autonomous zones, and events such as Carnival Against
Capital.[^238] These movements are not *anarchist*, but rather
*anarchistic*.[^239]

Mexico saw another uprising at the turn of the 21st century. Zapatistas
took control of a large area in Chiapas. They were organised in an
autonomous, self-governing model that has many parallels to anarchism,
inspiring many young anarchists in the West.[^240] Another stateless
region that has been associated with anarchism is the Kurdish area of
Rojava in northern Syria. The conflict there emerged during the Syrian
Civil War and Rojava's decentralized model is founded upon Bookchin's
ideas of libertarian municipalism and social ecology within a secular
framework and ethnic diversity.[^241] Chiapas and Rojava share the same
goal, to create a libertarian community despite being surrounded by
state apparatus.[^242]

Anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war,
anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements.[^243] Maia Ramnath
described those social movements that employ the anarchist framework
(leaderless, direct democracy) but do not call themselves anarchists as
anarchists with a lowercase *a* while describing more traditional forms
of anarchism with a capital *A*.[^244] Anarchists became known for their
involvement in protests against meetings such as the World Trade
Organization in Seattle in 1999, Group of Eight in 2001 and the World
Economic Forum, as part of anti-globalisation movement. Some anarchist
factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and
violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by
ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as
"<a   href="black_bloc.md" class="wikilink" title="black bloc">black blocs</a>.
Other organisational tactics pioneered during this period include
security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised
technologies such as the Internet.[^245] Occupy Wall Street movement had
roots in anarchist philosophy.[^246]

According to anarchist scholar
"<a   href="Simon_Critchley.md" class="wikilink" title="Simon Critchley">Simon
Critchley</a>, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful
critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism
\[...\] One might say that contemporary anarchism is about
responsibility, whether sexual, ecological, or socio-economic; it flows
from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the
West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning
inequality, impoverishment, and disenfranchisement that is so palpable
locally and globally".[^247] While having revolutionary aspirations,
many contemporary forms of anarchism are not confrontational. Instead,
they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization
(following the theories of dual power), based on mutual interdependence
and voluntary cooperation, for instance in groups such as
"<a   href="Food_Not_Bombs.md" class="wikilink" title="Food Not Bombs">Food
Not Bombs</a> and in self-managed social centers.[^248] Scholar Carissa
Honeywell takes the example of Food Not Bombs group of collectives, to
highlight some features of how contemporary anarchist groups work:
direct action, working together and in solidarity with those left
behind. While doing so, Food Not Bombs provides consciousness raising
about the rising rates of world hunger and suggest policies to tackle
hunger, ranging from de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto
seed-saving policies and patents, helping farmers, and resisting the
commodification of food and housing.[^249] Honeywell also emphasizes
that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only
of humans, but non-humans and the environment as well.[^250] Honeywell
argues that their analysis of capitalism and governments results in
anarchists rejecting representative democracy and the state as a
whole.[^251]
