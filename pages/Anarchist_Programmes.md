# Anarchist Programmes

## Overview

**Anarchist programmes** are strategic documents that outline the
theoretical foundations, practical goals, and organizational methods of
anarchist movements. Unlike traditional political party manifestos that
focus on electoral success and state power, anarchist programmes
articulate visions for revolutionary transformation based on principles
of
<a href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>,
<a href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>, and <a href="anti-authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarianism</a>.

These documents serve multiple functions within anarchist theory and
practice: they provide ideological coherence to diverse movements, offer
concrete steps toward anarchist society, and bridge the gap between
abstract anarchist principles and immediate political action.

## Origins

The tradition of anarchist programme writing emerged in the late 19th
century alongside the development of organized anarchist movements. The
1884 **Program and Organization of the International Working Men's
Association** represents one of the earliest systematic attempts to
codify anarchist principles into a coherent political programme.

This early period established key themes that would persist throughout
anarchist programme literature: the rejection of state socialism,
emphasis on <a href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>, and
the integration of economic and social transformation. The programmes of
this era reflected the influence of
<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>'s collectivist anarchism and
the growing anarchist presence within international workers' movements.

## Tendencies

### Classical Anarchist Programmes

Early 20th century programmes, exemplified by **Errico Malatesta**'s
1920 **An Anarchist Program**, focused on fundamental anarchist
principles while addressing practical questions of revolutionary
strategy. These documents typically emphasized:

- Abolition of private property and the state
- Establishment of <a href="free_association.md" class="wikilink"
  title="free association">free associations</a> of producers and
  consumers
- <a href="Direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Direct democracy">Direct democracy</a> and
  <a href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>
  as organizational principles
- <a href="Revolutionary.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Revolutionary">Revolutionary</a> rather than reformist
  approaches to social change

### Anarcho-Syndicalist Programmes

The 1927 **Programme of Anarcho-Syndicalism** by **Gregori Petrovich
Maximoff** represented a significant development in anarchist programme
literature. <a href="Anarcho-syndicalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-syndicalist">Anarcho-syndicalist</a> programmes
emphasized:

- <a href="Workers&#39;_councils.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Workers&#39; councils">Workers' councils</a> and
  <a href="labor_unions.md" class="wikilink" title="labor unions">labor
  unions</a> as vehicles for revolution
- <a href="General_strike.md" class="wikilink" title="General strike">General
  strike</a> as primary revolutionary tactic
- Integration of workplace struggle with broader social transformation
- Detailed economic planning for post-revolutionary society

### Contemporary Programmes

Modern anarchist programmes, such as those produced by the **Black Rose
Federation** (2023) and **CrimethInc** (2020), reflect contemporary
concerns while maintaining core anarchist principles:

- <a href="Climate_change.md" class="wikilink" title="Climate change">Climate
  change</a> and <a href="ecological_crisis.md" class="wikilink"
  title="ecological crisis">ecological crisis</a>

## Functions and Purposes

### Theoretical Coherence

Anarchist programmes serve to synthesize diverse anarchist traditions
into coherent political frameworks. They address tensions between
different anarchist schools of thought and provide theoretical
foundations for practical organizing.

### Strategic Planning

These documents outline concrete steps toward anarchist society,
addressing questions of revolutionary strategy, transitional
arrangements, and long-term organizational structures. They serve as
blueprints for anarchist movements seeking to move beyond critique
toward constructive alternatives.

### Movement Building

Programmes function as organizing tools, providing shared visions that
can unite diverse groups and individuals around common goals. They offer
accessible entry points for newcomers to anarchist politics while
maintaining theoretical rigor.

### Practical Application

Many programmes include detailed proposals for immediate reforms and
revolutionary actions. They bridge the gap between anarchist theory and
practice, offering concrete guidance for activists and organizers.

## Key Themes

### Anti-Statism

All anarchist programmes reject the state as a tool for social
transformation, distinguishing anarchist approaches from
<a href="Marxist-Leninist.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> and
<a href="social_democratic.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democratic">social democratic</a> alternatives. This
anti-statist position shapes all other aspects of anarchist programme
content.

### Economic Democracy

Programmes typically advocate for
<a href="worker_cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperatives">worker cooperatives</a>,
<a href="mutual_aid_networks.md" class="wikilink"
title="mutual aid networks">mutual aid networks</a>, and
<a href="gift_economies.md" class="wikilink" title="gift economies">gift
economies</a> as alternatives to both capitalism and state socialism.
Economic democracy is viewed as inseparable from political freedom.

### Federalism

Most anarchist programmes propose
<a href="federal.md" class="wikilink" title="federal">federal</a>
structures that balance local autonomy with broader coordination. This
federalist approach reflects anarchist commitments to both individual
freedom and collective action.

### Revolutionary Transformation

While tactical approaches vary, anarchist programmes generally advocate
for revolutionary rather than reformist change. They view existing
institutions as fundamentally unreformable and call for their
replacement with anarchist alternatives.

## Criticism

### Internal Debates

Anarchist programmes have generated significant debate within anarchist
movements. Critics argue that formal programmes contradict anarchist
principles of spontaneity and anti-authoritarianism. The
**<a href="Platform.md" class="wikilink" title="Platform">Platform</a>**
debate of the 1920s exemplified these tensions, with some anarchists
viewing organizational programmes as inherently authoritarian.

### Practical Limitations

Some critics argue that anarchist programmes are overly utopian and fail
to address practical challenges of large-scale social organization.
Questions about economic coordination, defense, and conflict resolution
remain contentious within anarchist programme literature.

### Revolutionary Strategy

Debates continue over whether anarchist programmes should focus on
immediate reforms or revolutionary transformation. Some argue that
programmatic approaches inevitably lead to reformism, while others
contend that clear programmes are necessary for effective revolutionary
action.

## Contemporary Relevance

Modern anarchist programmes continue to evolve in response to
contemporary challenges. Climate change, technological surveillance, and
global capitalism have prompted new programmatic approaches that
maintain core anarchist principles while addressing 21st-century
realities.

The rise of <a href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a> and
<a href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>
strategies has influenced recent programme development, with documents
like **Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid** (2017) emphasizing the
construction of alternative institutions alongside resistance to
existing ones.
