# Nuevo Estilo de Relaciones

**Nuevo Estilo de Relaciones** (NER), or "New Style of Relationships",
is an organizational philosophy and methodology developed by Spanish
businessman Koldo Saratxaga that emphasizes radical
<a href="self-management" class="wikilink"
title="self-management">self-management</a>, transparency, and worker
empowerment. The NER approach represents a practical implementation of
many
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
principles within business organizations, including the elimination of
hierarchical control, collective decision-making, and the equitable
distribution of economic benefits.

## Origins

NER emerged from the successful transformation of Spanish manufacturing
company <a href="Irizar" class="wikilink" title="Irizar">Irizar</a>
under the leadership of Koldo Saratxaga. After witnessing thousands of
visitors to Irizar who made excuses about why such radical
organizational changes would not work in their own contexts, Saratxaga
founded K2K Emocionando in 2005 to prove that the model could be
successfully replicated across diverse organizations and industries.

In 2010, organizations implementing NER principles formed the **Ner
Group**, an association that has grown to revolutionise 120
organizations employing over 1,000 people across more than 60 countries,
with combined annual revenues exceeding €400 million.[^1]

## Core Principles

The NER philosophy is based on a **Decalogue** of ten fundamental
principles that align closely with anarchist organizational theory:

### Liberty

Organizations composed of free, conscious, committed and responsible
people without hierarchical structures, emphasizing flexibility and
adaptability.

### Self-Management

Structures based on <a href="self-management" class="wikilink"
title="self-management">self-management</a> that share voice and vote
among all team members, with interrelated teams acting collectively.
This principle directly reflects anarchist concepts of
<a href="direct_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and worker control.

### Responsibility

Promotion of individual responsibility toward the organization's
purpose, customers, efficiency, and the common good - embodying the
anarchist principle that freedom requires responsibility.

### Trust and Transparency

Complete information sharing among all members and participatory,
inclusive dynamics that place people at the center of decision-making
processes.

### Ethics and Social Commitment

Organizations maintain solid ethical foundations contributing to a
human, just and sustainable society. Specifically, NER organizations:

- Allocate 2% of annual productive hours to society
- Distribute 5% of profits to social causes
- Maintain balanced wage ratios (maximum 3:1 between highest and lowest
  salaries)
- Refuse to use dismissals as solutions to economic difficulties
- Eliminate overtime as a business strategy

## Implementation Process

The NER transformation follows a radical eight-step process that
prioritizes worker
<a href="consent" class="wikilink" title="consent">consent</a> and
<a href="collective_decision-making" class="wikilink"
title="collective decision-making">collective decision-making</a>:

### Ownership Commitment

Complete buy-in from company owners, including agreement that the CEO
can be replaced if they obstruct the transformation process.

### Worker Democracy

The entire organization shuts down for two days to allow employees to
visit already-transformed companies. Workers then vote anonymously on
whether to proceed - requiring over 80% approval before any
transformation begins.

### Individual Assessment

One-on-one meetings with all workers to understand their feelings,
dreams, and fears about the proposed changes.

### Radical Transparency

Implementation of complete financial transparency, including open salary
information and comprehensive financial education for all workers.

### Economic Democracy

Workers receive 30% of additional profits distributed equally among all
members, aligning individual interests with collective success.

### Network Structure

Traditional hierarchies are replaced with networks of self-managing
teams organized around products, services, regions, or processes.

### Team Leadership

Teams select their own coordinators every six months through democratic
processes.

### Commitment-Based Work

Elimination of time-based control mechanisms (time clocks, approval
forms) in favor of team-based commitment meetings and results-focused
accountability.

## Relationship to Anarchist Principles

NER represents a practical application of key anarchist organizational
concepts within capitalist economic structures:

**<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="Mutual Aid">Mutual Aid</a>**:
The 2% allocation of work time to social projects and profit-sharing
demonstrate solidarity beyond individual organizations.

**<a href="Direct_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="Direct Democracy">Direct Democracy</a>**: Worker voting on
transformation, team selection of coordinators, and collective
target-setting eliminate representative hierarchies.

**<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="Workers&#39; Self-Management">Workers' Self-Management</a>**:
Complete elimination of traditional management structures in favor of
autonomous, self-coordinating teams.

**<a href="Horizontal_Organization" class="wikilink"
title="Horizontal Organization">Horizontal Organization</a>**: Flat
salary ratios and transparent decision-making processes minimize power
differentials.

**<a href="Collective_Ownership" class="wikilink"
title="Collective Ownership">Collective Ownership</a>**: While not
eliminating private property entirely, profit-sharing and collective
decision-making create forms of economic democracy.

## Results and Impact

Organizations implementing NER have demonstrated significant
improvements across multiple metrics:

- Economic results improved by 25-300% within two years of
  transformation
- Average productivity increases of 40%
- Zero economic dismissals during transformation processes
- Average salaries 27.4% higher than regional averages
- Absenteeism 32.4% lower than national averages
- Accident rates seven times lower than industry standards[^2]

## Criticism

While NER has achieved measurable success, critics argue that:

- The model operates within capitalist frameworks rather than
  challenging fundamental property relations
- The requirement for owner buy-in limits its applicability to
  worker-owned enterprises
- Some transformation attempts have failed due to ownership
  non-compliance or union resistance

## Contemporary Relevance

NER demonstrates that anarchist organizational principles can be
successfully implemented at scale within contemporary economic systems.
The model provides practical evidence for anarchist arguments about the
efficiency and sustainability of non-hierarchical, democratically
managed organizations.

The NER Universe has expanded to include additional organizations that
have adopted similar principles, creating a growing network of
enterprises operating according to libertarian socialist values.
