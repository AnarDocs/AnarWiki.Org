From Harold Barclay, People Without Government [^1]:

> Australian society, like that of other hunters, is organised on a band
> basis. Several families traditionally hunted and camped together and
> claimed a territory for economic exploitation and as a ritual and
> totemic centre. These families were related and for the most part
> through the male line, usually to a common paternal grandfather or
> great grandfather.
>
> Australians have often been described as the most primitive people in
> the world - or as having the simplest culture. But such descriptions
> contribute more to confusion and misunderstanding of Australian
> cultures than they do to clarification. It is true that few people
> known to modern society have possessed a more rudimentary and limited
> technology. An Australian could readily . . carry all his earthly
> possessions under his arm. Spears and throwing sticks were his most
> elaborate form of projectile; he did not know the use or manufacture
> of the bow and arrow. In technology Australians did not elaborate on a
> wide range of different types of tools, rather they concentrated on
> the development of a great many styles within a few kinds of tools.
> Thus, one finds a wide variety of throwing sticks or of spears.
>
> Similarly Australians did not experiment with many different social
> structures; their social organisation was based on the single
> principle of kinship. Yet, they managed to invent a variety of kinship
> structures. Indeed, they played upon a single theme - that of dual
> division- in such a way as to create several complex kinship patterns.
> The most elementary form of dual division is to cut a society into two
> groups (moieties) which engage in mutual exchange, including the
> exchange of women, so that wives are derived from the opposite group.
> Australians elaborated this dual principle so as to create four and
> eight 'section' systems which determined incest rules and the persons
> whom one might marry. To the outsider, such as the introductory
> anthropology student, these systems become extremely complex
> conundrums. Australian mythology and ceremony and their attendant art
> forms are similarly by no means simple or crude. On the contrary, they
> must be recognised as rich and highly developed. In sum, Australians
> seem to have taken a minimum number of simple principles and woven
> them into a complex web of variant Patterns. Further, they seem to
> have been highly concerned with the realms of kinship, mythology and
> ceremonial and uninterested in technology. In contrast, western
> society has been interested primarily in the latter while innovation-
> in kinship and ceremonial verges on being tabooed. Thus arises the
> misleading notion that Australians are 'primitive' (in a pejorative
> sense), crude and simple.
>
> Australian political organisation requires no complexity and it has
> none. Their political system has been called a 'gerontocracy' - by
> which is meant a rule by old men. More correctly, for Australia it
> means that older men are the most influential and their opinions are
> accepted because of the prestige of their elderly positions. Further,
> one's elders are one's grandfathers, so there is the moral force of
> kinship behind their words. One accepts the decision of the elder
> males also out of fear of public opinion, believing all others in the
> band would disapprove of any dissent. Further, older men are
> considered to have a certain sanctity, since it is they who are the
> repositories of all the sacred wisdom of the group. Among the Murngin,
> for example, each clan has ceremonial leaders who know all the rituals
> of that clan. The position is inherited from father to son. By control
> of the ceremonial system these leaders also control who may be
> initiated into which ceremonies and at which time. This is extremely
> crucial to the Murngin male, who, in order to be a fully fledged
> member of society, must in the course of his life pass through several
> rites of passage from one age group to another. These rites reveal
> knowledge which is held to be necessary to group survival. Life is a
> process of being initiated into various ceremonies and, thus, secrets
> of life, and its climax is the ultimate initiation into "the final
> mysteries of life by seeing the most esoteric of the totems" (Warner,
> 132). The main force available to the elders, then, appears to be a
> supernatural sanction: the threat of withholding admission to certain
> knowledge deemed essential to success in life. Additionally, elders
> may turn public opinion against a person.
>
> Within a band the elders are the ones concerned with dealing with
> strangers and the ones responsible for organising blood feuds or
> instigating others to impose a punishment on malefactors. Elders,
> however, have no power as a police force to enforce law. They can only
> encourage physically stronger men in the community to try to impose a
> punishment on an alleged culprit.
>
> Supernatural sanctions form an important part of the Australian's
> techniques to maintain order. Bone pointing is well known and one does
> not have to be a particular specialist in order to use it. In this
> technique a magic bone is pointed in the direction of one's enemy, who
> is, of course, informed that this has been done. Consequently the
> victim is supposed to become ill and die. As Cannon long ago pointed
> out, this "technique does achieve results. Victims appear to die
> because they simply resign themselves to death. Like the Inuit the
> Australians have part-time religious specialists or shamans. These
> undergo special initiations, often under the direction of a group of
> shamans who constitute a kind of rudimen1ary guild of craft
> specialists. Shamans have the power to counteract the magic of an
> enemy. They can also destroy another man. This they are a major force
> for mobilising and influencing public opinion and, according to
> Warner, they are as effective in this respect as ceremonial leaders
> (242).

> Australian society represents a political system with somewhat more
> structure and formality than characterised the Inuit and Pygmy.
> Indeed, gerontocratic features are more common to African
> horticulturalists. Australians, nevertheless, function according to
> diffuse and religious sanctions. The control by the older men of
> access to those ceremonial initiations deemed essential for attaining
> full male status, approaches a rudimentary government. Yet since
> Australian groups are communities of kinsmen and these elders are
> kinsmen, addressed and treated as such, their position is more clearly

> elders in no way have any monopoly on the uses of violence to impose
