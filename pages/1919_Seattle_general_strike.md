In February 1919, some 100,000 workers went on a general strike for five
days, halting the city's operations except for those organized by the
strikers themselves and coordinated by a General Strike Committee
consisting of three delegates from each striking local. The Committee
authorized firefighters to keep working, and striking workers prepared
and served thirty thousand meals across the city each day. Strikers set
up a Labor War Veteran's Guard, which sent unarmed volunteers to patrol
the streets and keep the peace. A blackboard at the Guard's headquarters
read, "The purpose of this organization is to preserve law and order
without the use of force. No volunteer will have any police power or be
allowed to carry weapons of any sort, but to use persuasion only."[^1]
During the strike, crime decreased in Seattle; "\[t\]he commander of
U.S. army detachment sent into the area told the striker's committee
that in forty years of military experience he hadn't seen so quiet and
orderly a city."[^2] The federal government sent almost a thousand
soldiers and sailors into Seattle. Workers ended their strike after five
days due to pressure from unions' international officers and the
difficulties of living in a shutdown city.[^3]
