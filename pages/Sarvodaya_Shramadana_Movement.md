The **Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement** is a
<a href="self-governance" class="wikilink"
title="self-governance">self-governance</a> movement in
<a href="Sri_Lanka" class="wikilink" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>
that provides comprehensive development and
<a href="conflict_resolution" class="wikilink"
title="conflict resolution">conflict resolution</a> programs to
villages. Founded in 1958 by
<a href="A._T._Ariyaratne" class="wikilink" title="A. T. Ariyaratne">A.
T. Ariyaratne</a>, the movement is inspired by
<a href="Gandhism" class="wikilink" title="Gandhian">Gandhian</a> and
<a href="Buddhism" class="wikilink" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> ideas
of *swaraj* (self-governance), *sarvodaya* (common good), and
*shramadana* (shared labor).

As of 2006, Sarvodaya staff and programs are active in some 15,000 (of
38,000) villages in Sri Lanka, with 2,000 of them self-governed and
self-reliant.[^1] The organization estimates that 11 million citizens
are individual beneficiaries of one of its programs. In 2008, Ariyaratne
estimated that the movement provides services to 11 million people.[^2]

The movement is also the largest indigenous organization working on
reconstruction from the

the <a href="2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake" class="wikilink"

## Etymology

The movement is based on
<a href="Buddhism" class="wikilink" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and
<a href="Gandhism" class="wikilink" title="Gandhian">Gandhian</a>
principles. Coined by
<a href="Mahatma_Gandhi" class="wikilink" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma
Gandhi</a>, the term *sarvodaya* means 'welfare for all'. The word
*shramadana* means 'gift of labour'. Collectively, the name 'Sarvodaya
Shramadana' means 'welfare for all through our shared labour'.

## History

The movement began in 1958 when
<a href="A._T._Ariyaratne" class="wikilink" title="A. T. Ariyaratne">A.
T. Ariyaratne</a>, then a young teacher at
<a href="Nalanda_College_Colombo" class="wikilink"
title="Nalanda College Colombo">Nalanda College Colombo</a>, led forty
high school students and twelve teachers on what he called an
"educational experiment" to an
<a href="Untouchability" class="wikilink" title="outcaste">outcaste</a>
village, Kathaluwa, and helped the villagers fix it up. The success of
this experiment, repeated in other villages, led to the creation of the
largest development-promoting organization in Sri Lanka.

In 1958, the neglected village of
<a href="Rodiya" class="wikilink" title="Rodiya">Rodiya</a>, inhabited
by social outcasts and beggars, received help in the form of renovating
houses, digging wells and latrines, and establishing community gardens.
Educational programs and self-employment help were also launched. The
organizer was
<a href="D._A._Abeysekera" class="wikilink" title="D. A. Abeysekera">D.
A. Abeysekera</a>, an employee of the Sri Lankan Department of Rural
Development, who while searching for solutions for this kind of
community coined the term *Shramadana*, meaning 'gift of labour', to
describe the type of help expected from volunteers.

## Philosophy

Ariyaratne describes the movement's libertarian vision:

> "We dream of a world which is a commonwealth of self-governing
> communities. We dream of people enjoying participatory democracy;
> where all human rights are respected, where spiritual and moral values
> are strong, where people respect nature, and finally where
> communication technologies are highly developed so that each community
> can be in close touch with its own nation and the world. Only then can
> the world's resources and the advancement in science and technology
> contribute to a world free of violence as well as poverty."[^3]

Sarvodaya Shramadana strives to "Create a no poverty, no affluence, and
a conflict-free society" and to make sure everyone in Sri Lanka can meet
basic needs. Author
<a href="John_P._Clark" class="wikilink" title="John P. Clark">John P.
Clark</a> has argued that the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement are
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a> in
their organisation and goals, noting their inspiration from the
philosophical anarchist
<a href="Mahatma_Gandhi" class="wikilink" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma
Gandhi</a>.

## Ten Basic Needs

Activists led by Ariyaratne tried to meet the real needs of the
villagers. To this end, they conducted research in 600 villages, asking
residents to list their ten most important needs. The survey resulted in
a list of the following needs:

1.  A clean and beautiful environment
2.  Clean drinking water
3.  Adequate supplies of clothing
4.  Adequate and balanced nutrition
5.  Simple housing
6.  Basic health care
7.  Basic communication facilities
8.  A minimal supply of energy
9.  Holistic education
10. Satisfaction of spiritual, cultural needs and peace building[^4]

## Development Process

The Sarvodaya program begins with an invitation from a village for a
discussion of what is needed and how it can be done. Assistance
deliberately begins with a change in the attitude of the villagers, and
satisfying basic needs is only the third stage.

Sarvodaya Shramadana has a 5-step development process:

1.  Psychological infrastructure development
2.  Social infrastructure development and training
3.  Satisfaction of basic human needs and institutional development
4.  Income and employment generating and self-financing
5.  Sharing with neighbouring villages[^5]

The program proceeds through creating a village council, building a
school and clinic, setting up family programs, creating economic
opportunity so that the village economy becomes self-sustaining,
starting a village bank, and offering help to other villages.

## Achievements

The movement has established more than 5,000 pre-schools and thousands
of community banks and saving societies. The group distributes funds
from a financial reserve bank of 1.6 billion
<a href="Sri_Lankan_rupee" class="wikilink" title="rupees">rupees</a>.
The movement's peace meditations, dialogues, and workshops have
attempted to bring healing and coexistence to a country with a history
of ethnic war.[^6]

Sarvodaya sponsors public meditations in which tens and sometimes
hundreds of thousands of Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians
meditate together on each other's welfare, using the Buddhist
<a href="Brahmavihara" class="wikilink"
title="Brahmavihara">Brahmavihara</a> (sublime attitude) meditations,
which are acceptable within all faiths.

## Diversity and Inclusion

Members of the Sarvodaya Shramadana movement come from a diversity of
religions and ethnicities:

> "Sarvodaya builds houses side by side for Christians, Buddhists,
> Muslims, and Hindus. Peace Secretariat teams are led by Muslim,
> Christian, and Hindu Sarvodaya personnel. The Movement consciously
> directs its efforts to people of all religious persuasions. Its
> purpose is not to proselytise but to help participants see their
> common humanity."[^7]

## Information and Communication Technology

<a href="Fusion_–_Sarvodaya_ICT4D_Movement" class="wikilink"
title="Fusion – Sarvodaya ICT4D Movement">Fusion – Sarvodaya ICT4D
Movement</a> is the ICT for development (ICT4D) program. As a response
to the emerging digital divide issues of rural Sri Lanka, Sarvodaya
started setting up telecentres experimentally in 1997. This has led to
the pioneering
<a href="telecentre" class="wikilink" title="telecentre">telecentre</a>
program in the country. Village Information Centres (popularly known as
VICs) are rural libraries, set up by village youth leaders as 'Zero
Cost' village initiatives, which prepare disadvantaged, less educated
rural communities for the information age. Out of the 172 VICs initiated
since early 2000, there are about 21 VICs graduated to their own forms
of telecentres by mid-2008.

In September 2012, <a href="Etisalat_(Sri_Lanka)" class="wikilink"
title="Etisalat Sri Lanka">Etisalat Sri Lanka</a>, a mobile telephony
provider in cooperation with Sarvodaya-Fusion, opened *Etisalat Android
Village Hub*. The program aims to connect rural communities using

which the company distributed to 20 families in selected villages for a
period of two weeks and conduct internet training.

## Tsunami Relief

On December 26, 2004, at 9 am, waves flooded the fishing town of
<a href="Hambantota" class="wikilink" title="Hambantota">Hambantota</a>.
The director of one of the institutes for sustainable agriculture in
Sarvodaya, <a href="Nandana_Jayasinghe" class="wikilink"
title="Nandana Jayasinghe">Nandana Jayasinghe</a>, was about an hour
away from the tragedy, in <a href="Thanamalwila" class="wikilink"
title="Thanamalwila">Thanamalwila</a> next to
<a href="Udawalawe_National_Park" class="wikilink"
title="Udawalawe National Park">Udawalawe National Park</a>. After 6
hours he arrived in the town with three 10-ton trucks full of food,
water, blankets and other means of survival. In the following days, he
organized the next deliveries, and temporary housing for the population
and, along with other volunteers in the movement, helped clean up and
reorganize the town after the tragedy.

The tsunami destroyed 226 villages belonging to the Sarvodaya movement.
In total, the movement built 1104 houses, 5593 toilets, 2274 wells, 2450
waste composters, 185 water tanks and 85 playgrounds for the victims of
the tsunami. The Sarvodaya movement tried to get help from recipients
themselves, in order for them to feel responsible and take part in
rebuilding their own lives.

## Criticisms

In 1999, Knabb criticized Sarvodaya, citing a chapter from the 1997
collection *Entering the Realm of Reality*:

> "One of the articles in the book in fact admits the failures of
> Sarvodaya (pp. 256-260), pointing out how such organizations function
> primarily as temporary stopgaps among sectors neglected by capitalist
> development and are generally abandoned the moment such development
> becomes accessible to them."[^8]
