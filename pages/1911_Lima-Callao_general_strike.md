In March of 1911, anarcho-syndicalists in Lima-Callao, Peru organized a
strike of five hundred cotton workers, who demanded wage increases, a
reduction of the workday from thirteen to ten hours, and the night
shift's elimination. The strike expanded into a general strike on 10
April, "bringing Lima's businesses and transport to a standstill,"
according to Steven Hirsch in "Peruvian Anarcho-Syndicalism."[^1] The
next day, Peru's president intervened and management agreed to the
workers' demands.[^2]
