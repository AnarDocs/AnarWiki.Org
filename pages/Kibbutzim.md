Starting in the early 20th century, Jewish settlers in Palestine
established horizontally-managed communities called kibbutzim. The Romni
group, founders of the first kibbutz, defined the kibbutz in 1910 as "a
cooperative community without exploiters or exploited".[^1]

Within the movement, anarchist influences have existed uneasily aside an
allegiance to Zionist settler-colonialism. Gabriel Piterberg argues that
"the kibbutz was first and foremost a colonizing tool for the formation
of a settler project, and that it was based to a considerable degree on
social and ethnic exclusion." The kibbutzim rarely included non-European
Jews and almost totally excluded Palestinians.[^2] According to Uri
Davis, a Palestinian-Jewish scholar and anti-apartheid campaigner, "the
Zionist co-operative movement in Palestine has been a primary driving
force in the development and consolidation of Israeli apartheid; playing
a role similar to that played by the Dutch Reform Church in the
development and consolidation of South African apartheid."[^3]

The economic success of the kibbutzim can be seen in their
disproportionate contribution to Israel's agricultural and industrial
output. In the 1970s, the kibbutzim housed only 3.8 percent of Israeli
Jews but produced half of Israel's food and seven percent of the
industrial product.[^4] In 2010, with no more than 1.6 percent of
Israel's Jewish population, the 270 kibbutzim produced 40 percent of
Israel's agricultural product worth \$8 billion and 9 percent of
industrial product worth \$1.8 billion.[^5]

In 2010 and 2011, the total kibbutz population was estimated to be
between 120,000[^6] and 127,000 including 4,000 non-member residents. To
this day, the kibbutzim practice a degree of direct democracy, although
greater amounts of privitization and hierarchy have been adopted over
time. Only 15 of the 270 kibbutzim still followed the "full traditional
communal model" in 2010.[^7]

Martin Buber celebrated the kibbutzim an "experiment that did not fail,"
and he mentioned two reasons. First was the "non-doctrinaire origins"
which allowed for adaptation at the local level based on each
community's "particular social and spiritual needs." Second was a
tendency towards federation enabling mutual aid between communities.[^8]
Noam Chomsky has said the early kibbutzim "came closer to the anarchist
ideal than any other attempt that lasted for more than a very brief
moment before destruction". Graham Purchase wrote that the kibbutz
became "exactly the sort of modern communal village/small town life
which Kropotkin had envisaged". Josef Trumpeldor, an influential kibbutz
activist, described himself as "an anarcho-communist and a Zionist".
[^9] Although some members opposed the establishment and existence of a
Zionist state, the kibbutz movement overall was complicit in the Zionist
colonization of Palestine and oppression of the Palestinian people.

# Culture

The kibbutzim were committed to an egalitarian and, at times largely
secular, Jewish culture. A kibbutz statement of principle reads, "The
strength of the kibbutz lies in its essential social nature which
strives for the complete harmony of the individual and the group in
every sphere of life, for the maximum development of each
individual...and for the constant deepening of human ethical
relations."[^10] Early kibbutz members stressed that labor, particularly
self-managed labor, was an end in itself and a fundamental human need. A
common saying at the kibbutzim went, *ki ha-avodah hi chayenu* (for
labor is he essence of our life).[^11]

Traditionally, kibbutz children were raised communally rather than by
their parents. Parents frequently complained about feeling separated
from their children, and many kibbutzim drifted away from strictly
communal childrearing.[^12] The kibbutzim proclaimed a commitment to
equality of men and women, but the anthropologist Melford Spiro, who
spent 11 months at Kiryat Yedidim in 1951, found that women complained
that they were frequently assigned to "women's work" and that the
community valued such work less than agriculture. Of the 113 able-bodied
women at the kibbutz, 88 percent worked in service jobs like child care,
teaching and cooking. The remainder were farmers.[^13]

Kiryat Yedidim residents found that they had very little privacy or time
alone, since time outside of work was filled with "holidays,
celebrations committee meetings, classes, lectures, movies, and the
bi-weekly town meeting."[^14] Residents had very few possessions, since
they were only given each year the equivalent of nine dollars for
spending money. The kibbutz supplied for free all food, clothing,
housing, health care, education and personal items like toothbrushes and
combs. Members viewed with suspicion anyone who spent too much time
alone or who accumulated too many possessions. Despite a lack of
privacy, residents enjoyed complete liberty to say, write and read what
they chose.[^15]

## Gender and Sexuality

The kibbutzim strove for gender equality, and the Kfar Blum members
Yosef Criden and Saadia Gelb reported in 1976 that this ideal had been
achieved depending on how it's defined. They note that the movement was
not successful at early attempts to eradicate gender-based division of
labor. Women were permitted to have any job, and some engaged in
physically strenuous jobs such as driving tractors and building roads.
However, physical differences and complications of pregnancy generally
led women into service jobs such as being hostesses, secretaries,
bookkeepers, teachers, and librarians. "But women are not forced to
accept 'service jobs if they find them uncongenial," says Criden. "Women
can take on any job they wish and are capable of doing. Some kibbutz
women hold managerial positions; here in Kfar Blum, the head of our
flower-growing and export department is a woman. Some of our women are
psychologists and our kibbutz doctor, too, is a woman. Other women work
in the fields. One of our women is a shoemaker."[^16]

Criden and Gelb noted in 1976, "there is very little free love or
promiscuity" in the kibbutzim, since gossip and jealousy proved too
large an obstacle in these tightly knit communities. Monogamy was the
norm, and the divorce rate was much lower than in Israel's cities.[^17]

## Race and Ethnicity

Kibbutzim generally excluded non-Jewish Palestinians, and attempts to
integrate Palestinians clashed with the Zionist commitment. Gelb notes,
"But an Arab worker cannot be offered kibbutz membership so freely.
After all, the kibbutz idea is a Zionist one...\[W\]e cannot very well ,
under the present circumstances, ask an Arab to join a society that is
dedicated to the upbuilding of a Jewish state."[^18]

Spiro found that kibbutz members displayed strong prejudices against
non-Jewish and non-white members, including the non-Jewish wife of a
kibbutz doctor and Jews from Morocco and Iraq. Spiro heard a kibbutz
member complain about slow work in the kitchen, "What can you expect?
The only ones working there now are Africans, Asiatics, and
Americans!"[^19]

'Haaretz'' discusses the changing attitudes toward queer members: "In
the ‘80s and ‘90s, Israeli society began a slow process of accepting
LGBTQ people and treating them equally, a process that reached its peak
in recent years. But in the small kibbutz communities this process took
longer." The article quotes a 1985 posthumous letter by a recently
deceased gay man coming out to fellow kibbutz members: "The phenomenon
of being LGBTQ on a kibbutz is unique because, unlike in the city, where
you can live next to neighbors who will never know anything about you,
on a kibbutz you can’t remain anonymous. I ask you, my heterosexual
friends, can a person live like this? My despair and sexual hunger
wouldn’t leave me. I sought ways to satisfy this hunger. I tried to find
a way to leave with the kibbutz's help. Why didn’t \[the kibbutz
leaders\] realize that they should have helped me? Why didn’t they let
me leave? Maybe I would have found a partner. It was clear to both you
and me that here on the kibbutz I couldn’t have a relationship.”[^20]

# Decisions

The kibbutzim have put into practice anarchist concepts of
self-management, direct democracy and confederation. The first kibbutz,
Degania, distinguished itself from previous Jewish farming settlements
by using majority vote to make all managerial decisions. By 1914, Jewish
settlers had started 28 self-managed farms, with a total of 380 members,
that operated on principles similar to Degania's.[^21]

As summarized by Criden and Gelb in 1974, the highest authority in the
kibbutz was the general meeting, and five people were elected to the
offices of treasurer (*bakoah*), general manager (*merakez meshek*),
work manager (*sidur 'avodah*), secretary (*mazkir*) and purchasing
agent. The treasurer also served as the delegate who interacted with the
kibbutz federation and Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of the
kibbutz.[^22]

Many decisions are delegated to the various committees. Gelb reports:

> "There are so many committees in every kibbutz \[...\] For example,
> the economic committee deals with investments, expenditures, the
> budget and all other matters relating to the economic welfare of the
> kibbutz \[...\] The welfare committee is a catchall for anything
> having to do with the individual member, his personal needs, his
> grievances, and his relationship with the committees and officers of
> the kibbutz. There is a children's committee, a youth committee, and a
> committee for the care of aged parents."[^23]

At Kiryat Yedidim in 1951, members met twice a week at town meetings to
make decisions on items like the budget, electing officers, and
punishing people who broke the community rules. Members elected a
general secretary who prepared the meeting agendas, chaired the
meetings, and served as the kibbutz's delegate in the federation of
kibbutzim. The secretary received assistance from a secretariat, a
nominating committee, an education committee, a high school committee, a
cultural committee, a welfare committee, a security committee, and a
landscape committee. Every kibbutz member at some point served as an
officer, in a committee, or in some other position of authority. No
officer was allowed to serve for more than two or three years, and the
positions, like all work on the kibbutz, were unpaid.[^24]

# Economy

From their beginning in the Second Aliyah, cooperatively-run farms
proved capable of achieving, in the words of scholar James Horrox,
"efficiency without coercion."[^25] Referring to the Second Aliyah's
cooperatively-run "proto-kibbutzim" known as *kvutza*, Horrox writes,
"Every one of the kvutza settlements provided a better return on capital
invested than the market-driven farms of the First Aliyah
immigrants."[^26]

Kibbutz federations share resources and labor with each other. Today, 94
percent of Israel's kibbutzim belong to the Kibbutz Movement coalition,
which houses the TAKAM and Artzi confederations.

Traditionally, the kibbutzim allowed no private property and had strict
cultural norms against the accumulating of non-essential personal
possessions. People pooled resources together, and members could take as
much as they needed. An elected committee would rotate people's jobs,
trying to assign each person an interesting variety of tasks and take
into account their personal preferences. Children would live together
and would only visit their parents for a few hours each day and on most
of the day for Shabbat and holidays. Peer pressure and public opinion
were used to prevent people from slacking off and violating communal
rules.

Kibbutzim have come to abandon some of their communal features. In the
1970s, they abandoned their policies of separating children from their
parents. In the 1980s, many dining halls started charging for food. Now,
many kibbutzim hire full-time managers. However, about 130 kibbutzim
still continue to practice communal self-management. A 1999 report on
Kibbutz Geffen found that the workplace's managers were elected and
rotating, and had no coercive authority over workers. At some urban
kibbutzim today, residents hold regular, outside jobs, but practice
direct democratic, communal living.

More kibbutz members now work in industry than in agriculture (25
percent of adult residents work in industry, 15 percent in agriculture).
Their main areas of industry are plastic and rubbers, metals and
machines. The kibbutzim provide 40 percent of Israel's gross added value
from agriculture. [^27]

A study by Ran Abramitzky in *Journal of Economic Perspectives* found
that kibbutz residents worked longer hours than other Israeli Jews, in
both urban and rural areas, from the years 1961 to 1995. Abramitzky
concluded that the economic success of the kibbutzim "requires a lack of
privacy and small group size that facilitate social sanctions, and
strong limits on private ownership of property." [^28]

## Education

James Horrox summarizes the classic education structure of the original
kibbutzim:

> "The education system the kibbutz created was based on the idea that
> children should also live in their own community environment, a
> 'community of youths' that would make the peer group the major
> socialising force rather than the traditional nuclear family
> structure. From infancy onward, children on most kibbutzim lived
> together in the children's house, where their parents visited for a
> few hours every day and for most of the day on Shabbat and holidays.
> Children were raised and educated in groups, usually around sixteen,
> who remained together from nursery school through to high school. Life
> within these groups was guided by the same democratic principles that
> governed the kibbutz's adult society.
>
> The youth society (composed of adolescents aged thirteen to eighteen)
> existed as a self-governing body in its own right, with its own
> general assembly, work and social committees. The *madrich* guided the
> group and interceded only if the children's behaviours deviated
> drastically from kibbutz norms. Agriculutral or other vocational
> training was valued just as much as academic learning, and, from the
> earliest possible age, children were encouraged todo useful work and
> take up their natural role int he productive life of the
> community."[^29]

A comparison of the mainly Ashkenazi (of European-Jewish ancestry)
kibbutz residents with Israel's Ashkenazi population found that the
kibbutznik were better educated. Literacy and high school education was
nearly universal on the kibbutz, making this population better educated
than Ashkenazi Jews in both the rural and urban parts of Israel.[^30]

# Environment

Important theorists of the kibbutz movement, such as A.D. Gordon, saw
agricultural labor as a way to connect with Palestine's environment.
James Horrox summarizes some of Gordon's writing, "Physical, and in
particular agricultural work, he believed, enabled the human being to
connect with nature through creativity, and it was therefore through a
return to the land that individuals, peoples and humanity would be able
to find spiritual succour and a more meaningful way of life".[^31]

Kibbutz Lotan, with its Center for Creative Ecology, practices and
teaches visitors about organic gardening and construction with materials
from the local landbase. The kibbutz's website reports, "Over the last
four years Lotan, through its composting and recycling efforts, has
reduced its overall waste disposal by 70% each year."[^32]

# Crime

According to Criden, "the incidence of crime on kibbutzim is practically
nil." [^33] Wikipedia also summarizes, "There are very few issues of
crime on the kibbutz. Since everyone has their basic needs taken care of
and shares everything communally there is no reason for theft. The
kibbutz crime rate is well below the national average." [^34]

In 1940, a British airman stationed in Palestine wrote that in the
kibbutzim, "The problem of violence has simply not arisen". In 1986,
Josef Vlassii published a study on Kibbutz Vatik, noting the kibbutz had
never experienced any serious crime. James Horrox comments that these
"remarks on the non-existence of crime were all made at a time when many
of the communities were of equivalent size to small towns, or at least
large villages, many of them housing well over a thousand people
each."[^35]

To deal with transgressions, the kibbutzim rely on public opinion,
gossip and social consciousness.[^36] In a 1976 paper "Law in the
Kibbutz: A Reappraisal," Degania Aleph member Allan Shapiro provides
some examples from his own kibbutz the successor to the original
Degania. This community had, 498 members, including 265 adult members
and candidates.A woman had acquired a personal tea kettle in violation
of a rule at the time that allowed only a communal kettle. "Public
opinion was aroused by the member's clearly deviant behavior, and
ostracism was subtly but openly employed against the offender. Even her
husband joined in the campaign and refused to permit their children to
enter the family quarters during tea-time, lest they be tainted by the
anti-social conduct of their mother." At the same kibbutz, youth
destroyed a tractor during an April Fool's prank. In response, the
Education Committee held a hearing with the youth and the Farm Manager
present. At the meeting, the youth expressed remorse and volunteered to
help the silo manager in their free time. No punishment was
administered. [^37]

Spiro reports that at Kiryat Yedidim, choir members once were not
showing up to rehearsals, and there was a concern that they would not
learn their songs in time for the Passover seder. The Holiday Committee
posted a notice on the bulletin board that the seder would be cancelled
if the choir did not learn the songs. The notice also included a list of
the choir members. In the next three days, choir rehearsals had full
attendance, and the choir sang at the seder. In rarer cases, the kibbutz
punished people at town meetings. Once, a member was accused of
stealing. A town meeting examined evidence and found the member guilty.
The kibbutz decided to expel this member.[^38]

Criden provides the example of someone who drives a tractor too fast or
recklessly: "If it is just a youngster of fourteen or fifteen, we let
the school handle it. If it is an adult, the farm manager will tell him
off and if he is really a chronic offender we will forbid him to ever
drive a tractor again. But we have never needed a police force to settle
problems like that."[^39]

# Revolution

As described by Peter Gelderloos, the kibbutz movement's negligence to
take an oppositional stance toward capitalism and Zionism led to it
becoming largely compromised and contaminated by the hierarchical and
racist norms of mainstream Israeli society. Moreover, the movement
suffered a backlash due to its underestimation of their members' desire
for personal privacy:

> After about a decade, the kibbutzim began to succumb to the pressures
> of the capitalist world that surrounded them. Although internally the
> kibbutzim were strikingly communal, they were never properly
> anti-capitalist; from the beginning, they attempted to exist as
> competitive producers within a capitalist economy. The need to compete
> in the economy, and thus to industrialize, encouraged a greater
> reliance on experts, while influence from the rest of society fostered
> consumerism.
>
> At the same time, there was a negative reaction to the lack of privacy
> intentionally structured into the kibbutz — common showers, for
> example. The purpose of this lack of privacy was to engineer a more
> communal spirit. But because the designers of the kibbutz did not
> realize that privacy is as important to people’s well-being as social
> connectedness, kibbutz members began to feel stifled over time, and
> withdrew from the public life of the kibbutz, including their
> participation in decision-making.
>
> Another vital lesson of the kibbutzim is that building utopian
> collectives must involve tireless struggle against contemporary
> authoritarian structures, or they will become part of those
> structures. The kibbutzim were founded on land seized by the Israeli
> state from Palestinians, against whom genocidal policies are still
> continuing today. The racism of the European founders allowed them to
> ignore the abuse inflicted on the previous inhabitants of what they
> saw as a promised land, much the same way religious pilgrims in North
> America plundered the indigenous to construct their new society. The
> Israeli state gained incredibly from the fact that nearly all their
> potential dissidents — including socialists and veterans of armed
> struggle against Nazism and colonialism — voluntarily sequestered
> themselves in escapist communes that contributed to the capitalist
> economy. If these utopians had used the kibbutz as a base to struggle
> against capitalism and colonialism in solidarity with the Palestinians
> while constructing the foundations of a communal society, history in
> the Middle East might have turned out differently. [^40]

Still, some see the kibbutzim as having a potentially revolutionary role
in the future. Modeled in part on the kibbutz movement, Bill Templer
proposes a "no-state solution" in Palestine/Israel, "a kind of
Jewish-Palestinian Zapatismo, a grassroots movement to ‘reclaim the
commons’."[^41]

# Neighbouring Societies

As noted earlier, the kibbutzim became corrupted by the capitalist and
Zionist pressures of mainstream Israel. Moreover, the kibbutzim played a
core role in the settler colonization of Palestine. "We have always
regarded the Kibbutz Federation as the central force in the realization
of the Zionist project," Jewish Agency director Yossef Almogi remarked
in 1977.[^42]

The kibbutzim generally did not permit non-Jewish members and especially
did not permit Palestinian and Arab members. As *The Candid Kibbutz
Book* comments:

> \[A\]pplications from Arabs are invariably rejected. This was true of
> Arab socialists waiting to join the egalitarian communities, as well
> as for the Arab (male) fiancés of kibbutz members who were recently
> refused acceptance by the kibbutzim of Gan Shmuel and Yad Hanna."[^43]

Moreover, "The kibbutz movement uniformly welcomed the 'liberation' of
the territories captured by Israel in the June War of 1967."[^44]
