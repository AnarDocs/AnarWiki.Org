# Jewish Anarchism

## Overview

"<a   href="Jacques_Ellul.md" class="wikilink" title="Jacques Ellul">Jacques
Ellul</a> recounts that at the end of the
"<a   href="Book_of_Judges.md" class="wikilink" title="Book of Judges">Book of
Judges</a> (Judges 21:25) there was no king in Israel and everyone did
as they saw fit.[^1][^2] Later in the first Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 8)
the people of Israel wanted a king to be like other nations. God
declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that
a human king would lead to militarism, conscription, and taxation and
that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered.
Samuel passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they disregarded
him and chose Saul as their king. Much of the subsequent Tanakh
chronicles them trying to live with this decision.[^3]

The first known Jewish Anarchist organisation in the United States was
the "<a   href="Pioneers_of_Liberty.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pioneers of Liberty">Pioneers of Liberty</a> (*Pionire der
Frayhayt*). The Haymarket trial of 1886 sparked nationwide interest in
anarchist ideas. On the day of the trial's sentencing, about a dozen
Jewish workers of New York's Lower East Side founded the Pioneers of
Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist organization in the United States.
The group ran *Varhayt*, a short-lived, first Yiddish-language anarchist
newspaper in the United States, between February and June 1889. Together
with the Jewish anarchist Knights of Liberty group, which sprang from
the Pioneers of Liberty, the two organizations together founded the
long-running Yiddish-language anarchist newspaper,
*"<a   href="Fraye_Arbeter_Shtime.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fraye Arbeter Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>*, in 1890.

The Orthodox Kabbalist rabbi
"<a   href="Yehuda_Ashlag.md" class="wikilink" title="Yehuda Ashlag">Yehuda
Ashlag</a> believed in a religious version of
"<a   href="libertarian_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian communism">libertarian communism</a>, based on
principles of Kabbalah, which he called altruist communism. Ashlag
supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of
self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually "annul the
brute-force regime completely, for 'every man did that which was right
in his own eyes'", because "there is nothing more humiliating and
degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government".[^4]

A British rabbi, "<a   href="Yankev-Meyer_Zalkind.md" class="wikilink"
title="Yankev-Meyer Zalkind">Yankev-Meyer Zalkind</a>, was an
anarcho-communist and very active anti-militarist. Rabbi Zalkind, a
close friend of
"<a   href="Rudolf_Rocker.md" class="wikilink" title="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf
Rocker</a>, was a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar.
He argued that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, is
closely related to anarchism.[^5] Zalkind's philosophy was not popular
with British Orthodox Jewry and Zalkind was shunned by the community,
with Chief Rabbi Hertz denying Zalkind's rabbinic credentials and
Zalkind being forced to renounce his rabbinic title.[^6]

The Yiddish anti-authoritarian and anti-police song
*"<a   href="Daloy_Politsey.md" class="wikilink"
title="In Ale Gasn/Daloy Politsey">In Ale Gasn/Daloy Politsey</a>* dates
from the time of the Russian Revolutions and continues to be sung by
artists who identify with political tendencies like anarchism.[^7] Many
versions of the song have been updated to talk about modern issues such
as government corruption, police brutality, and general anarchist
themes, along with translating them into languages like English and
German.

Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in Jewish
anarchism due to the growth of organizations like
"<a   href="Jewdas.md" class="wikilink" title="Jewdas">Jewdas</a> and Pink
Peacock (UK) and media outlets like the *Treyf* podcast (Canada). This
interest has been aided by the publication of new books on the subject,
such as Kenyon Zimmer's *Immigrants against the State*, and the
reissuing of documentaries such as *The Free Voice of Labour*, which
details the final days of the *Fraye Arbeter Shtime*. In January 2019,
The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research organized a special conference on
Yiddish anarchism in New York City, which drew over 450 people.[^8]

Jewish anarchist newspapers include
*"<a   href="Arbeter_Fraynd.md" class="wikilink" title="Arbeter Fraynd">Arbeter
Fraynd</a>*, *Burevestnik*,
*"<a   href="Chernoe_Znamja.md" class="wikilink" title="Chernoe Znamja">Chernoe
Znamja</a>* (Black Flag),
*"<a   href="Dos_Fraye_Vort.md" class="wikilink" title="Dos Fraye Vort">Dos
Fraye Vort</a>*, *"<a   href="Fraye_Arbeter_Shtime.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fraye Arbeter Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>*, *Germinal*, and
*Kagenna Magazine*.

Many people of Jewish origin, such as
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, "<a   href="Alexander_Berkman.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>,
"<a   href="Paul_Goodman.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Goodman">Paul

title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>,
"<a   href="Volin.md" class="wikilink" title="Volin">Volin</a>,
"<a   href="Gustav_Landauer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gustav Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a>,
"<a   href="David_Graeber.md" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a>, and
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> have played a role in the history of anarchism. However, as
well as these anarchists of Jewish origin, there have also been
specifically Jewish anarchist movements, within the Yiddish-speaking
communities of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Western cities to
which they migrated, from the late nineteenth century until the Second
World War. All the members of the first anarchist group in the Russian
Empire, which was formed in 1903 in Białystok, were Jews.[^9]

Different anarchist groups had different views on Zionism and the Jewish
question.
"<a   href="Bernard_Lazare.md" class="wikilink" title="Bernard Lazare">Bernard
Lazare</a> was a key figure in both the French anarchist movement and
early Zionist movement. The later Territorialist movement, especially
the Freeland League, under the leadership of
"<a   href="Isaac_Nachman_Steinberg.md" class="wikilink"
title="Isaac Nachman Steinberg">Isaac Nachman Steinberg</a>, was very
close to anarchism. Some others, such as
"<a   href="Martin_Buber.md" class="wikilink" title="Martin Buber">Martin
Buber</a> and "<a   href="Gershom_Scholem.md" class="wikilink"
title="Gershom Scholem">Gershom Scholem</a>, advocated non-nationalist
forms of Zionism, and promoted the idea of creating a binational
Jewish-Arab federation in Palestine. Many contemporary anarchists
support the idea of what has been dubbed the "no-state solution".[^10]
"<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> has said that, as an anarchist, he ultimately favors such a
no-state solution, but, in the short term, feels a two-state solution is
the best way out of the present conflict.[^11] Within Israel there is
also the organisation
"<a   href="Anarchists_Against_the_Wall.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchists Against the Wall">Anarchists Against the Wall</a>,
which is a direct action group composed of Israeli anarchists and
anti-authoritarians who oppose the construction of the Israeli Gaza
Strip barrier and Israeli West Bank barrier.
