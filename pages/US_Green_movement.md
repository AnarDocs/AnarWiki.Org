Before it became a reformist political party, the US Greens in the 1980s
and early 1990s had a strongly anti-authoritarian orientation, with
Murray Bookchin and other Anarchists taking part in chapters and
caucuses such as the Burlington Greens, Youth Greens, and Left Greens.

In May 1984, at the first North American Bioregional Congress, activists
met and formed a "Green Movement Committee" to form an ecological
movement based on the German Greens. The working group planned a
conference in St. Paul that summer and adopted Ten Key Values:
Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal and Social
Responsibility, Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-Based
Economics, Postpatriarchal (feminist) Values, Respect for Diversity,
Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. The group defined the new
organization as a federation of local alliances, rather than a national
political party. They called themselves the Committees of Correspondence
after the "<a   href="Anarchy_in_the_American_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="committees in the American Revolution">committees in the American
Revolution</a>. Members left the St. Paul convention and and spread the
word across the country.[^1]

In 1985, a local Green Party formed in New Haven, Connecticut and ran
candidates for City Council. They came in second to the Democrats,
beating the Republicans. Months after the election, a City Council
member joined the Greens, becoming the first Green elected official in
the country.[^2]

The Greens held their first national conference in Amherst,
Massachusetts in 1987. In 1988, Murray Bookchin and other social
ecologists circulated a call for a Left Green Network, a network which
wound up calling themselves social ecologists and advocating the
abolition of capitalism and the state. To the displeasure of the
movement's more moderate elements, the Left Greens introduced and passed
a variety of radical proposals into the Greens' platform at a 1990
convention in Colorado: opposition to emissions trading, support for
indigenous sovereignty, a three-quarters reduction in the military
budget, and more. By 1990, there were 150 active Green locals and 200
other affiliated groups.[^3]

A Youth Greens caucus, formed around this time by recent Institute for
Social Ecology students, also embraced an anarchist position. The Youth
Greens and Left Greens partnered to organize a march on Wall Street on
Earth Day of 1990. At 6 am, affinity groups gathered at New York's
Liberty Plaza (later renamed Zucotti Park and the site of Occupy Wall
Street in 2011), dressed in black bloc attire to conceal their
identities.

> Dozens of young folks showed up at Liberty Plaza at 6am, and quickly
> got to work building barricades on Broadway with bicycle racks,
> garbage cans, and pieces of wood from a nearby construction site,
> before the sun had even come up. Meanwhile, hundreds of additional
> folks arrived, and affinity groups began sitting down in front of the
> entrances of the police saw-horse mazes erected to make sure Wall
> Street opened for business. Six hundred police were mobilized for this
> purpose, in effect shutting down Wall Street, surrounding it with saw
> horses and riot cops so no one could get close. Over 1,500 people
> showed up for the action, which lasted till the late afternoon,
> blocking entrances and causing mayhem. Over 200 were arrested.[^4]

From 1986 to 1990, the "<a   href="Burlington_Greens.md" class="wikilink"
title="Burlington Greens">Burlington Greens</a> in Vermont combined
Anarchism with an involvement in local electoral politics. They followed
a strategy that Bookchin, a member, called libertarian municipalism or
Communalism. Their intent was to take local power and rewrite the city
charter, so that decision-making power would be transferred from
bureaucracies to directly democratic assemblies. Although the Burlington
Greens disbanded before they won any elections, some of the short-term
reforms they advocated in their campaigns were taken on and implemented
by the city government. Most notably, the Progressive Party
administration turned the city's waterfront into a public park and put
aside plans to develop condos there.[^5]

By 1990, there were over 150 active Green locals and 200 other
affiliated groups. Around this time, however, the movement began to
split into two factions: a reformist, electoral strand and a radical,
participatory strand. Exemplary of the reformist strand, in 1989 some
national-level activists formed an independent Green Party Organizing
Committee, which eventually became the famous U.S. Green Party that ran
Ralph Nader for president in 2000. The radical strand formed a national
organization called The Greens/Green Party USA in 1991. By the
mid-1990s, electoral politics had become the Green movement's de facto
focus, and for the most part the Left Greens and Youth Greens difted
away to other projects.[^6]
