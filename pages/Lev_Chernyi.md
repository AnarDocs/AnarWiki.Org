## Early Life

Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov was born into a noble family in the
Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire on 28 February 1878.[^1] His
father, Dmitry Turchaninov, was a colonel in the Imperial Russian
Army.[^2]

After coming of age, Turchaninov enrolled in Moscow University but was
expelled in 1901 for his activity in revolutionary groups.[^3] His
brother, Sergey Turchaninov, became a Marxist and empirio-criticist
philosopher.

## Revolutionary Activities

### Joining the Anarchist Movement

By the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1905, Turchaninov had
joined the anarchist movement.[^4] Under the pseudonym Lev Chernyi, he
wrote his foundational work *Associational Anarchism*, completing it in
February 1906. This manifesto outlined his individualist anarchist
philosophy based on the free association of individuals, drawing
inspiration from
<a href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">Max
Stirner</a>, <a href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>, and
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>.[^5]

Chernyi's brother Sergey, approaching anarchism from a Marxist
perspective, criticized the work for utopianism and lack of materialist
basis.[^6] The Ministry of Internal Affairs, in its "Review of the
Revolutionary Movement," described the book as a paraphrasing of
Proudhon's work,[^7] while modern researchers have compared it to
Stirner's *The Ego and Its Own*.[^8]

From 1906 to 1908, Chernyi was active in the *Buntar* (Rebel) group,
through which he began a relationship with fellow anarchist
<a href="Nina_Yagodina.md" class="wikilink" title="Nina Yagodina">Nina
Yagodina</a>.

### Siberian Exile

In April 1908, Chernyi was exiled to the Yeniseysk Governorate in
Siberia, while Yagodina was exiled to Arkhangelsk Governorate in the
Russian North. Refusing to accept separation from his comrade,
Turchaninov made multiple escape attempts.[^9]

In autumn 1908, he and a group of exiled revolutionaries planned to
escape Siberia by hijacking a steamship. On 8 December 1908, the group
ambushed a convoy at Osinovo and headed north along the Yenisey River,
despite Chernyi's objections to the route. On 2 January 1909, they
captured the town of Turukhansk, where they led an armed uprising
against Tsarist authorities. Though Chernyi had refused to participate
directly in the revolt, he was arrested on 16 February 1909. Two days
later, the Imperial Russian Army disarmed the rebels.[^10]

By this time, authorities had identified Turchaninov as the writer Lev
Chernyi. Despite his lack of direct involvement in the Turukhansk
uprising, the Ministry of Internal Affairs held him responsible for
organizing the mutiny.[^11]

### Exile in Paris

After this setback, Chernyi made a final, successful escape attempt from
Siberia. He fled to Paris, where he lived in exile until the outbreak of
the Russian Revolution of 1917.[^12] Details about Chernyi's Siberian
exile remained obscure until the opening of the State Archive of the
Russian Federation and the State Archive of Krasnoyarsk Krai revealed
documentary evidence of this period.[^13]

## Adulthood

### Return to Revolutionary Russia

Following the February Revolution of 1917, Chernyi returned to Moscow
and immediately threw himself into anarchist organizing. He joined the
Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, serving as the organization's
secretary.[^14] While the Federation largely opposed illegalist and
expropriative activities, Chernyi advocated for more militant action,
including the seizure of private homes from the bourgeoisie.[^15]

Following the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Chernyi helped organize
the <a href="Black_Guards.md" class="wikilink" title="Black Guards">Black
Guards</a>, the armed wing of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist
Groups.[^16]

### Resistance to Bolshevik Power

On 5 March 1918, in the second issue of *Anarkhiia* published after the
October Revolution, Chernyi published an article denouncing the new
Russian Soviet Republic, declaring it as much of a threat to freedom as
the old Tsarist regime.[^17] In subsequent issues, he outlined proposals
for the decentralization of industry and the abolition of hierarchical
power.[^18]

In his writings, Chernyi attacked the Bolsheviks with characteristic
venom, comparing state communists to "a pack of dogs with their tails
tied together," with their leaders serving as cattle drivers wielding
knouts over human society turned into a herd.[^19] The Bolshevik leaders
knew Chernyi well through his literary works, which predicted with
"nearly photographic precision" how they would reveal themselves as
"heartless, bloodthirsty tyrants, inquisitors, murderers and
gravediggers of liberty."[^20]

### Underground Anarchist Activities

By the summer of 1918, intensifying political repression drove many of
Moscow's anarchists underground. Chernyi facilitated the creation of an
underground faction of the Federation in 1918, and in 1919 joined the
Underground Anarchists, founded by Kazimir Kovalevich and Pyotr
Sobalev.[^21]

On 25 September 1919, the Underground Anarchists carried out a bombing
of a Russian Communist Party meeting, killing 12 functionaries and
wounding 55 others, including prominent Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin,
Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, and Yuri Steklov.[^22] The bombing resulted in an
intensification of repression against anarchists throughout Russia.
Chernyi himself was not directly involved in the bombing,[^23] but the
Bolsheviks knew him as a dangerous adversary who could neither be bought
nor frightened.[^24]

The Bolsheviks particularly feared Chernyi as the organizer of the Black
Guards, as the inspirer of mansion seizures, and most of all they feared
"his pen, murderous for the Marxist scribes and pharisees, his fiery
word, unceasing propaganda of anarchist ideas which shook the
foundations of Bolshevism."[^25]

## Death

During the wave of repression following the 1919 bombing, Lev Chernyi
and <a href="Fanya_Baron.md" class="wikilink" title="Fanya Baron">Fanya
Baron</a> were arrested on fabricated charges of counterfeiting. The
charges were a transparent pretext - several provocateurs, including
agents named Shteinerov, Zekhtser, and others, had contrived the case
involving supposedly forged Soviet rubles to provide an official excuse
for eliminating a prominent anarchist.[^26]

In September 1921, both Chernyi and Baron were executed by firing squad
by the Cheka.[^27] The Bolshevik government reported only that a
"bandit" named Turchaninov had been executed, lacking the courage to
admit they had killed Lev Chernyi, who was known throughout Russia and
the world as an outstanding anarchist philosopher.[^28]

The executions drew immediate protests from the Russian anarchist
movement, including from
<a href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, who was then living in Soviet Russia. The public outcry led
Lenin's government to order the release and immediate deportation of
some anarchist political prisoners, while other anarchists voluntarily
left the country.[^29]

A contemporary anarchist obituary proclaimed: "There are crimes that
cannot be forgotten or forgiven... The inquisitor and sadist
Dzerzhinsky, along with Lenin, Trotsky, Bukharin and other apostles of
knouto-Bolshevism, can truly be proud that Lev Cherny was tortured and
killed in the Cheka torture chambers by their mean hand."[^30]

## Political Ideology

Chernyi's "associational anarchism" represented a distinctly
individualist approach to anarchist theory,[^31] grounded in the
principle of free association of individuals.[^32] Together with
<a href="Alexei_Borovoi.md" class="wikilink" title="Alexei Borovoi">Alexei
Borovoi</a>, Chernyi was a leading figure of individualist anarchism
during the revolutionary period in Russia.

Both were inspired by <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>'s call for the
transvaluation of bourgeois values, as well as Max Stirner and Benjamin
Tucker's opposition to the tyranny of society over the individual. They
rejected even the anarchist communism advocated by
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, believing it would stifle individual freedoms in favor of
collective conformity.[^33]

Chernyi's work emphasized that true anarchism must be based on the
voluntary association of free individuals, not the coercive collectivism
promoted by state communists. His critique of Bolshevism proved
prescient, as the Communist regime revealed itself to be a new form of
authoritarian oppression that crushed both individual liberty and
genuine collective self-organization.

## Legacy

By murdering Chernyi, the Bolsheviks hoped to strike a fatal blow
against anarchism. Their calculations failed. As the 1923 obituary
noted: "Lev Cherny was killed, thousands of other anarchists and
revolutionaries were tortured and murdered in the torture chambers of
the Cheka, in prisons and exile. But anarchism, which the Bolsheviks
buried and performed last rites for, which was driven underground,
chained in heavy irons, was still not strangled, not crushed by the
dictatorship of 'proletariat', but is alive."[^34]

Following news of Chernyi's execution, his book *Associational
Anarchism* was immediately republished in America in 1923 as a protest
against Bolshevik barbarism. The book reached thousands of new readers
who had never heard of Chernyi or anarchism, creating "thousands of new
anarchists, and, consequently, instead of one political adversary –
thousands of new fighters" against Bolshevik tyranny.[^35]

Chernyi's execution exemplified the Bolshevik betrayal of the
revolution. He was "the best friend of the toilers, oppressed and
enslaved masses,"[^36] murdered by a regime that claimed to represent
the working class. His martyrdom revealed the true nature of the
"dictatorship of the proletariat" - a dictatorship not of workers, but
over workers, enforced by the Cheka's torture chambers and firing
squads.
