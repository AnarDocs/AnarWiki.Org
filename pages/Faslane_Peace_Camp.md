![](Faslane.jpg "Faslane.jpg") From Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works[^1]:

> One such attempt is the Faslane Peace Camp, a land occupation outside
> Scotland’s Faslane Naval Base, which houses Trident nuclear missiles.
> The Peace Camp is a popular expression of the desire for a peaceful
> society, organized on anarchist and socialist lines. Faslane Peace
> Camp has been continuously occupied since June 1982 and is now well
> established, with hot water and bathroom facilities, a communal
> kitchen and living room, and 12 caravans housing permanent residents
> and space for visitors. The Peace Camp serves as a base area for
> protests in which people block the roads, shut down the gates, and
> even penetrate the base itself to carry out sabotage. Galvanized by
> the Peace Camp, there is widespread popular opposition to the naval
> base, and some of Scotland’s political parties have called for the
> base to be closed down.
