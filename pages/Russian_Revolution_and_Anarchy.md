Best known for the overthrowing the Tsarist monarchy and installing the
Soviet Union, the 1917 Russian Revolution encompassed libertarian and
authoritarian strands that repeatedly clashed with each other over
contrasting strategies and visions. Voline, an Anarchist participant in
the revolution, summarizes in his book *The Unknown Revolution*:

> The Bolshevik idea was to build on the ruins of the bourgeois state,
> *a new “Workers' State”*...The Anarchist idea is to transform the
> economic and social bases of society *without having recourse to a
> political state*, to a government, or to a dictatorship of any
> sort.”[^1]

The Russian Revolution had many anti-authoritarian elements including
including Petrograd's factory committees, the uprising in Kronstadt,
and, most dramatically, the massive Anarchist revolution that
predominated among many villages in Ukraine. Yet, the Bolsheviks'
violent repression of these initiatives under party leader Vladimir
Lenin set precedents and cleared the way for the Soviet Union's move
toward totalitarianism. Maurice Brinton concludes in his study of the
Bolshevik's attacks on worker self-management, “The events described in
this pamphlet show that in relation to industrial policy there is a
clear-cut and incontrovertible link between what happened under Lenin
and Trotsky and the later practices of Stalinism.”[^2]

# February Revolution and Workers' Control

On February 23 1917, working women went on strike in Petrograd, sparking
a general strike in the city. Across Russia, masses of people decided to
side with the strikers rather than the Tsarist regime which was already
in severe crisis due to its disastrous decision to join the first World
War and fight against much more well-equipped armies. Within a week,
troops mutinied and the tsar abdicated power. The striking workers in
Petrograd formed a *soviet*, meaning council in Russian.[^3]

Soviets quickly formed across Russia, at a pace with which the Bolshevik
leadership could barely keep up. Russian workers and peasants had
established perhaps six hundred soviets by May, eight hundred by August,
and nine hundred by October.[^4] By October, workers self-managed the
vast majority of Russia's factories.[^5] Lenin commented that workers
and peasants were “a hundred times further to the left” than his
Bolshevik party.[^6]

With the tsar gone, the police disbanded and many bosses ran away.
Consequently, a situation of dual power arose between February and
October, in which a new bourgeois provisional government shared power
with a network of workers' organizations that ran much of the day-to-day
workings of society. Murray Bookchin summarizes:

> “Following the overthrow of the monarchy, a vast array of popular
> organizations—factory, neighborhood, military, and village committees,
> unions, and cooperatives—appeared in which workers, soldiers, sailors
> and peasants created a dazzling new social and economic reality that
> remade the institutional structure of Russian society. Russia's
> *komitetchina*, as this growth was called, which convened politically
> in local, regional, and all-Russian congresses and conferences, was
> comparable in degree of self-management only to that of the French
> revolutionary sections of 1793.”[^7]

To some extent, soviets were an important mechanism for workers to exert
control over the economy. Workers elected their delegates and had the
ability to immediately recall them. Still, the workers' interests were
filtered through the interests of a new class of representatives. Tom
Wetzel writes, “the soviet assemblies were not where the real decisions
were made. The executive made the real decisions in the backrooms. Some
decisions were submitted to the assembled delegates for ratification,
some were not.”[^8]

The other main instrument of worker control was the factory committee,
which Wetzel asserts was much directly democratic than the soviets: “The
most important decisions were made in general assemblies of the rank and
file.”[^9] The factory committees' powers varied over time, but
according to S. A. Smith, some of them around July or August had begun
“to monitor all aspects of production, including orders and
finances.”[^10]

In Petrograd, factory committees, worker cooperatives, soviets, and
trade unions coordinated to purchase and distribute food. The committee
at an explosives shop organized 2,500 cheap meals a day, and another
committee organized 1,200 dinners a day.[^11] Factory committees
produced theaterical performances, lectures, and classes.[^12] The
city's workers established workers' militias that protected
neighborhoods and existed uneasily alongside bourgeois “civil militias,”
until the provisional government disbanded the workers' militias in
July. Workers also established Red Guards to focus specifically on
protecting revolutionary gains.[^13]

Sometimes Anarchists complained about the authority of the soviets and
other vehicles of “worker's control.” In March, when a soviet threatened
to fire undisciplined workers, a group of Anarchists responded:

> The soviet of workers' deputies of the Pipe works, instead of making
> concrete proposals and raising questions for discussion by the general
> meeting, issues orders and threatens us with punishment, including the
> sack, if we do not carry them out...Formerly, we were slaves of the
> government and of the bosses, but now there is a new despotic
> government in the shape of our elected representatives, who, in a
> touching display of unity with the management, are executing the
> police task of supervising the conduct and work of the workforce.[^14]

# October Revolution

On 25 October 1917, the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government.
The next day, at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Bolshevik
spokesmen asked for the public to “put an end to all strikes on economic
and political issues, to resume work and carry it out in a perfectly
orderly manner.”[^15] Despite their slogan “all power to the soviets,”
the Bolsheviks (who renamed themselves the Communists after taking
power) aggressively transferred power from the soviets to the state
bureaucracy.

Partisans of Lenin often blame the leader's centralizations of power on
the urgency of the civil war that began in May 1918. However, the moves
toward centralization and repression began well before the civil war's
outbreak. On 1 October 1917, Lenin published *Can the Bolsheviks retain
State power?* which reduced “workers' control” to a mere “accounting of
the production and distribution of goods” with actual managerial
responsibilities held by “a proletarian state.”[^16] On 5 December 1917,
the new Communist government established the Supreme Economic Council or
*Vesenka*, which centrally planned the economy and further weakened the
soviets and factory committees. Lenin summarized a few weeks later: “we
passed from workers' control to the creation of the Supreme Council of
National Economy.”[^17] Lenin's *State and Revolution*, published in
December, defended authoritarian rule: “We want the socialist revolution
with human nature as it is now, with human nature that cannot dispense
with subordination, control and managers.”[^18]

The Cheka, the Communists' secret police, attacked Anarchist centers in
Moscow on 12 April 1918 and then attacked Anarchist centers in other
cities:

> Democratic soviets, free speech, opposition political parties and
> groups, self-management in the workplace and on the land -- all were
> destroyed in the name of "socialism." All this happened, we must
> stress, before the start of the Civil War in late May, 1918, which
> most supporters of Leninism blame for the Bolsheviks'
> authoritarianism. During the civil war, this process accelerated, with
> the Bolsheviks' systematically repressing opposition from all quarters
> -- including the strikes and protests of the very class who they
> claimed was exercising its "dictatorship" while they were in
> power![^19]

While Anarchists' form of (libertarian) socialism involved workers'
direct control over their workplaces, Lenin's vision of socialism merely
replaced one set of bosses with another. In 1917, Lenin wrote,
"\[S\]ocialism is merely state-capitalist monopoly *which is made to
serve the interests of the whole people* and has to that extent *ceased*
to be capitalist monopoly."[^20] From the Anarchists' point of view, the
new arrangement never "ceased" to be capitalist. To the contrary, as
Bakunin would have predicted, the new set of bosses did not represent
the interests of the masses.

By October 1918, the Communist government "was in practice a Party
Dictatorship" with an economic policy of "State Capitalism with
'one-man' management the official policy," according to Iain McKay.[^21]
McKay argues that the Communists' insistence on economic centralization
made an inherited economic crisis even worse. He quotes the political
scientist Thomas Remington:

> shortage of fuel and materials in the city took its greatest toll on
> the largest enterprises, whose overhead expenditures for heating the
> plant and firing the furnaces were proportionately greater than those
> for smaller enterprises … Not until 1919 were the regime’s leaders
> prepared to acknowledge that small enterprises… might be more
> efficient… and not until 1921 did a few Bolsheviks theorists grasp the
> economic reasons for this apparent violation of their standing
> assumption that larger units were inherently more productive.[^22]

# Green partisans

The Greens were named after the forests and marshes from where they
defended themselves against the Red and White Armies. Based in the
peasantry, they counted Anarchists among their supporters. According to
authors of a 2018 *Capital & Class* article, the Greens practiced mutual
aid, direct democracy, and egalitarian social relations.[^23] They rose
a green and black flag that today green anarchists raise. They were
brutally crushed by the Red Army which "engaged in scorched-earth
tactics against peasant communities considered to be supportive of the
guerrilla movement."[^24]

# Kronstadt rebellion

*Note: This section is copied from
"<a   href="Kronstadt_rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">"Kronstadt rebellion</a>*

In 1921, the sailors, soldiers and workers of Russia's Kronstadt naval
fortress proclaimed a libertarian-leaning "third revolution", (following
the February 1917 revolution that overthrew the Tsar and the October
1917 revolution installed the Soviet Union).

According to Leon Trotsky, the Kronstadt sailors had been "the pride and
glory of the Russian Revolution" of 1917.[^25] In May 1917, the
Kronstadt soviet (workers' council) declared itself the only legitimate
government of the fortress, and decisions were made at general
assemblies, held almost daily.[^26]

By the end of 1917, Kronstadt's residents had become disillusioned by
the authoritarianism of the new Communist government. Defying the
Communists' instructions, the people of Kronstadt socialized their
dwellings. Each residential building established a House Committee, and
these committees confederated into a District Committee. The District
Committees confederated into a Borough Committee.[^27] In February 1921,
Kronstadt secretly sent delegates to Petrograd with the message that "if
the workers rise up in a third, genuinely proletarian revolution for the
real slogans of October, then Kronstadt will support them with all its
strength, unanimously and with the will to conquer or die."[^28]

On 24 Februrary 1921, Petrograd's workers went on strike. Four days
later, as the military violently repressed the strike, sailors from one
of Kronstadt's battleships, Petropavlovsk, passed a resolution
supporting the Petrograd workers. On 1 March, some 16,000 of Kronstadt's
sailors, soldiers and workers met and unanimously affirmed
Petropavlovsk's resolution. The resolution demanded new elections for
the soviets, freedom of speech, freedom for peasants, the release of
political prisoners, and other reforms:

> “Resolution of the General Meeting of the 1st and 2nd Squadrons of the
> Baltic Fleet, held on March 1st, 1921.
>
> `   “After having heard the reports of the delegates sent to Petrograd by the general meeting of the crews to examine the situation, the assembly decided that, since it has been established that the present Soviets do not express the will of the workers and peasants, it is necessary:`

On 2 March, three hundred delegates met and established the Provisional
Revolutionary Committee to prepare new elections for Kronstadt's soviet
and to defend the area against inevitable repression from the State. The
Communists responded by securing control of strategic points around
Krokstadt, maintaining their repressive siege on Petrograd, making
certain concessions to workers to calm them, organizing a special army
corps to attack Kronstadt, and launching a campaign of slander against
Kronstadt.[^30]

The Communist Party leadership claimed Kronstadt's rebellion was led by
the Tsarist ex-general Kozlovsky and other White Guards. Although
Kozlovksy did not play any role in the rebellion, it was true that he
served as a military specialist in Kronstadt; the reason is that Trotsky
himself had installed Kozlovsky there! Moreover, Trotsky appointed the
Tsarist ex-officer Tuchachevsky at the command of the forces preparing
to repress the Kronstadt revolt. By contrast, Kronstadt's Provisional
Revolutionary Committee did not include any White Guards.[^31]

On 5 March, Trotsky sent Kronstadt an ultimatum, warning that Kronstadt
must “submit immediately to the authority of the Soviet Republic...Only
those who surrender unconditionally can expect mercy from the Soviet
Republic.”[^32] For ten days, from 7 March to 17 March, the Soviet
military bombed and shelled Kronstadt.[^33]

Emma Goldman and other Anarchists unsuccessfully tried to get the
Communists to agree to a peace deal with Kronstadt. Goldman explains
that "Kronstadt had never had any thought of 'mutiny' against the Soviet
government. Right up to the last, it was determined to spill no blood.
Continually it called for a compromise and amicable settlement. But,
forced to defend itself against military provocation, it fought like a
lion."[^34] There are no reliable figures on how many rebels were killed
during the repression of Kronstadt, but one 1935-6 statistical review
estimates that the 10,026 people were arrested following the
revolt.[^35]
