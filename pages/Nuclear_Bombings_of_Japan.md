## Debate

Debate has raged for nearly 75 years about the ethics, necessity,
purpose and legality of the deployment of nuclear weapons against the
Japanese Empire. Supporters of the nuclear bombings argue that:

- Japan would refuse to surrender, leading to a land invasion which
  would killed millions of people
- The bombings were necessary to take out key military targets
- Even if the bombings were unethical, they unintentionally showed the
  world of the destruction of nuclear weapons, the horrors of which
  scared the USA and USSR to never destroy eachother

Critics of the bombings argue that:

- Japan was already in the process of surrending, and the bombings were
  to intimidate the USSR and prevent them from taking all of Korea and
  China.
- The bombings were an act of terrorism as they intimidated the
  government via killing civilians
- The bombings could've been dropped in the ocean surrounding the
  cities, averting the deaths but still scaring the government
- An embargo could've militarily defeated Japan

### Quotes by Supporters

"There are voices which assert that the bomb should never have been used
at all. I cannot associate myself with such ideas. ... I am surprised
that very worthy people—but people who in most cases had no intention of
proceeding to the Japanese front themselves—should adopt the position
that rather than throw this bomb, we should have sacrificed a million
American and a quarter of a million British lives."[^1] - Winston
Churchill, Prime Minister of the UK

### Quotes by Critics

"The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb
played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the
defeat of Japan." - Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief of
the US Pacific Fleet and representative of the United States when Japan
formally surrendered

"The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all." -
Major General Curtis LeMay, US 21st Bomber Command

“The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no
material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already
defeated and ready to surrender.… in being the first to use it,
we…adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark
Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be
won by destroying women and children.”[^2] - Admiral William Leahy,
President Truman's Chief of Staff
