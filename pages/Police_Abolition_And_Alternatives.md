## Introduction

The institution of policing stands as one of the most visible and
violent expressions of state power in modern society. From the slave
patrols of the antebellum American South to the militarized forces
patrolling our streets today, police have consistently served not to
protect and serve communities, but to maintain existing hierarchies of
power and control. This analysis examines the origins, functions, and
failures of policing from an anarchist perspective, arguing for its
complete abolition and the construction of liberatory alternatives
rooted in community self-defense and mutual aid.

## The Repressive Origins of Modern Policing

### From Slave Patrols to Modern Police

The lineage of American policing can be traced directly to its most
shameful origins. In 1819, South Carolina enacted a law requiring all
white men over 18 to participate in slave patrols, with failure
punishable by fines.[^2] These patrols had "full power and authority to
enter any plantation and break open Negro houses or other places when
slaves were suspected of keeping arms; to punish runaways or slaves
found outside their plantations without a pass; to whip any slave who
should affront or abuse them in the execution of their duties."[^3]

This system of racialized control evolved directly into modern American
policing. As Frank Wilderson III observes, "white people's signifying
presence is manifested by the fact that they are, if only by default,
deputized against those who do magnetize bullets. In short, white people
are not simply 'protected' by the police, they are—in their very
corporeality—the police."[^4]

### The Birth of "Professional" Policing

Meanwhile, in Britain, the formation of the London Metropolitan Police
in 1829 followed the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, where cavalry charged
into a peaceful gathering of 60,000 workers demanding parliamentary
reform, killing 15 and wounding hundreds.[^5] The subsequent creation of
a "professional" police force was designed to manage and control the
working class through less overtly violent means—what became known as
"soft policing."

As Kristian Williams notes, modern policing emerged not in response to
rising crime rates, but as "a means of social control by which an
emerging dominant class could impose their values on the larger
population."[^6] In Boston, for example, crime actually decreased
between 1820 and 1830, yet modern police were still established in
1838.[^7]

## The True Function of Police

### Protecting Property, Not People

The police exist primarily to protect private property and maintain
existing economic hierarchies. As the anonymous author of the "Manifesto
for the Abolition of the Police" states, police "embody the defense of
private property (against 'property crimes,' as one says of the charges
often filed against demonstrators). They confer reality on the idea of
private property, just as they do for the idea of the state."[^8]

Statistics consistently demonstrate that police are remarkably
ineffective at their supposed primary functions. In Scotland, for
example:

- Only 5.5% of reported rapes and attempted rapes end in conviction
- Only 6.1% of sexual assaults result in conviction
- Only 6.1% of housebreakings end in conviction
- The robbery conviction rate is only 2.4%[^9]

### Manufacturing Crime and Criminals

Rather than preventing crime, police actively create it through the
criminalization of poverty, mental illness, and survival activities. The
majority of arrests are for misdemeanors and "public order"
offenses—what Sidney Harring wryly notes comes "perilously close to the
historian's description of 'working-class leisure-time activity.'"[^10]

This process of criminalization serves multiple functions:

- It justifies the expansion of police power
- It creates a steady supply of prison labor
- It maintains social hierarchies through selective enforcement
- It diverts attention from systemic causes of social problems

### Institutional Racism and Violence

Police violence disproportionately targets communities of color,
continuing the legacy of slave patrols. In Scotland, despite claims that
institutional racism is only an "English or American problem," a 2020
report found that a senior police officer claimed Police Scotland is
"institutionally racist"—information that was covered up by the Scottish
government.[^11]

The violence is not accidental but systematic. As the "Manifesto for the
Abolition of the Police" explains, "The police officer is the State's
ideal form of citizenship. For citizens, the cop represents the dream of
a perfect form of justice."[^12] This ideal citizenship is constructed
through the exclusion and dehumanization of racialized others.

## The Myth of Police Reform

### Seven Dangerous Myths

CrimethInc. identifies seven persistent myths that prevent people from
understanding the true nature of policing:

1.  **Police exercise legitimate authority** - In reality, police
    regularly lie, bluff, and act outside legal bounds
2.  **Police are ordinary workers** - Their role is fundamentally
    different: defending the ruling class
3.  **Some police officers are good people** - Individual character is
    irrelevant when the institution itself is oppressive
4.  **Police can win any confrontation** - They are limited by
    bureaucracy, public opinion, and resource constraints
5.  **Police are a distraction from the real enemy** - They are the
    armed enforcers of an unjust system
6.  **We need police to protect us** - Communities can protect
    themselves more effectively
7.  **Resisting police is violent** - Self-defense against oppression is
    justified[^13]

### The Failure of Reform

Police reform consistently fails because it addresses symptoms rather
than the structural function of policing. Body cameras, civilian
oversight, and diversity training do not change the fundamental role of
police as enforcers of an unjust social order. As Logan Marie
Glitterbomb notes, "We don't want rainbow cop cars, diversity training,
hate crime legislation, body cameras, non-binary prisons, or any other
reform which expands the scope and budget of policing."[^14]

## The Case for Abolition

### Beyond Punishment to Transformation

The goal is not to reform police but to eliminate them entirely. As CARA
(Communities Against Rape and Abuse) demonstrates, community-based
responses to harm can be more effective than state punishment:

- Prioritize the self-determination of survivors
- Identify plans for safety and support
- Organize collectively
- Maintain clear political analysis
- Communicate demands to those who cause harm
- Engage in long-term transformation processes[^15]

### Community Self-Defense

True security comes from communities organizing themselves. Examples
include:

**Copwatch Programs**: Groups that monitor police activity, document
abuse, and educate communities about their rights[^16]

**Community Patrols**: The Huey P. Newton Gun Club promotes "Black
Panther style community patrols where they both protect the community
from internal crime and violence in their communities and track police
activity"[^17]

**Restorative Justice**: Programs like the Community Conferencing Center
in Baltimore facilitate community conferences based on indigenous
practices of "hearing what happened, letting everybody say how they've
been affected by the situation, and then having the group come up with
ways to repair the harm and prevent it from happening again"[^18]

## Alternatives to Policing

### Immediate Alternatives

**Emergency Networks**: Instead of calling police, establish networks of
friends, family, and neighbors who can respond to emergencies. Apps like
Cell411 and Peacekeeper facilitate rapid community response[^19]

**Self-Defense Training**: Martial arts, firearms training, and other
forms of self-defense allow communities to protect themselves without
relying on state violence[^20]

**Dispute Resolution Organizations (DROs)**: Voluntarily contracted
services providing mediation, reimbursement for damages, personal
protection, and credit reporting[^21]

### Addressing Root Causes

Most crime stems from poverty, inequality, and social alienation. As
John Lonergan, Governor of Mountjoy Prison in Dublin, observes: 75% of
Dublin prisoners come from just six areas of social deprivation, with
heroin addiction rising from 31% in 1986 to 67% in 1996.[^22]

Real crime prevention requires:

- Meeting basic human needs (food, shelter, healthcare)
- Providing meaningful work and education
- Addressing mental health and addiction
- Creating inclusive communities
- Eliminating poverty and inequality

### Post-Revolutionary Justice

In an anarchist society, community justice would be:

- **Democratically controlled**: No special police class with power over
  others
- **Focused on restoration**: Repairing harm rather than punishment
- **Preventive**: Addressing causes rather than symptoms
- **Voluntary**: Based on free association and mutual aid

As Gregor Kerr explains: "The idea of 'prosecuting' an offender will be
done away with. Instead—where necessary—evidence will be presented
before a democratically elected community forum, weighed up in an open
manner with the 'accused' given every opportunity to question it."[^23]

## International Examples

### Community Restorative Justice in Northern Ireland

During "The Troubles," when British colonial forces abandoned policing
militant neighborhoods, communities developed their own restorative
justice projects. In the first two years, these projects opened about
700 cases and closed more than 90% of them successfully. A pilot project
in Derry saw 98% of residents sign onto the project's charter.[^24]

### Street Committees in South Africa

Under Apartheid, Black communities formed "Street Committees" to address
crime and disputes without relying on the racist police force. By the
end of Apartheid, an estimated 400 Street Committees operated throughout
South Africa, focusing on healing and restorative justice rather than
punishment.[^25]

## The Path Forward

### Building Dual Power

We must simultaneously resist existing police power while building
alternative structures. This includes:

**Immediate Actions**:

- Organizing copwatch programs
- Creating emergency response networks
- Training in conflict resolution and self-defense
- Supporting community accountability processes

**Long-term Strategy**:

- Building mutual aid networks
- Developing community self-defense capacity
- Creating alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
- Addressing root causes of social problems

### Revolutionary Perspective

As the "Manifesto for the Abolition of the Police" concludes: "The
abolition of the police is a new idea in France and throughout the
world. The end of the police is not any more complex of an undertaking
than was their recent beginning."[^26]

Police abolition is not utopian but practical. Communities have always
existed without police, and many continue to function through mutual aid
and collective action. The question is not whether we can live without
police, but whether we can afford to continue living with them.

## Conclusion

Police are not broken—they are functioning exactly as designed. They
were created to protect property and maintain social hierarchies, and
they continue to serve this function today. Reform cannot fix an
institution whose very purpose is oppression.

True safety comes not from armed agents of the state, but from
communities that meet everyone's needs and resolve conflicts through
democratic participation and mutual aid. As we build these alternatives,
we move closer to a world where human dignity and freedom replace
domination and control.

The choice is clear: we can continue to submit to an institution rooted
in slavery and designed to oppress, or we can build the infrastructure
of a free society. The tools exist. The knowledge exists. The only
question is whether we have the courage to use them.

"Everything is possible! Everything for everyone! Fuck the police!"[^27]
