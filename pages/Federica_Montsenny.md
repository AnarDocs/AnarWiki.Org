# Federica Montseny

> "The love of liberty and the sense of human dignity are the basic
> elements of the anarchist creed" - *Federica Montseny*

**Frederica Montseny i Mañé** (1905–1994) was a Spanish
<a href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>,
intellectual, and writer who was a prominent member of the
<a href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT) and the
<a href="Iberian_Anarchist_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Iberian Anarchist Federation">Iberian Anarchist Federation</a>
(FAI). She is historically significant as the first woman cabinet
minister in Spanish history, serving as Minister of Health and Social
Assistance during the <a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, and as one of the first
female ministers in Western Europe. Despite her pragmatic decision to
join the Republican government, she remained committed to anarchist
principles throughout her life and continued her anarchist militancy
during decades of exile in France.

Following the defeat of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War,
Montseny fled into exile where she continued organizing within the
anarchist movement. She was one of the main delegates at the
<a href="Congress_of_Carrara.md" class="wikilink"
title="Congress of Carrara">Congress of Carrara</a> (1968), one of the
major anarchist congresses of the 20th century, where she represented
the FAI and advocated for the foundation of the
<a href="International_of_Anarchist_Federations.md" class="wikilink"
title="International of Anarchist Federations">International of
Anarchist Federations</a>.

As a writer, Montseny published approximately fifty novels with
romantic-social themes aimed at working-class women, alongside
political, ethical, biographical and autobiographical writings that
advanced anarchist and feminist ideas.

## Family

Federica Montseny was born into an anarchist family of considerable
intellectual influence. Her parents,
<a href="Joan_Montseny.md" class="wikilink" title="Joan Montseny">Joan
Montseny</a> and
<a href="Teresa_Mañé.md" class="wikilink" title="Teresa Mañé">Teresa
Mañé</a>, were both teachers and committed anarchists of Catalan origin.
From 1898, they jointly edited the influential anarchist journal
*<a href="La_Revista_Blanca.md" class="wikilink"
title="La Revista Blanca">La Revista Blanca</a>*, one of the most
significant anarchist publications of the period.[^1]

The family lived in Madrid because her father had been imprisoned and
exiled following the
<a href="1896_Barcelona_Corpus_Christi_procession_bombing.md"
class="wikilink"
title="1896 Barcelona Corpus Christi procession bombing">1896 Barcelona

Spain, they settled in the capital where they continued their anarchist
activism and publishing work.

## Early Life

Federica Montseny was born on 12 February 1905 in Madrid, the sole
surviving child of her anarchist parents.[^2] Her childhood was marked
by the family's precarious financial situation and constant harassment
by authorities. The
<a href="Civil_Guard.md" class="wikilink" title="Civil Guard">Civil
Guard</a> frequently raided their home searching for her father, and
young Federica learned to delay the guards at the door to give him time
to hide.[^3][^4]

Montseny received her education entirely at home from her parents, who
employed <a href="progressive_education.md" class="wikilink"
title="progressive education">progressive education</a> methods. Her
mother used progressive didactic approaches to foster Montseny's
intellectual curiosity, providing wide-ranging reading materials and
encouraging independent pursuit of knowledge. This education exposed her
to literature, social theory, and political philosophy from an early
age. She credited both her parents' pedagogical approach and the rural
environment of her childhood with shaping her intellectual development
and lifelong connection between anarchist thought and natural
philosophy.[^5][^6]

## Adulthood

### Anarchist Activism

Montseny became active in the anarchist movement as an adult,
contributing to anarchist publications and developing her theoretical
positions. She wrote extensively for anarchist journals and newspapers,
becoming known for her articulation of anarchist-feminist positions and
her romantic novels aimed at working-class women readers.

### Spanish Civil War and Government Participation

Following the <a href="Spanish_coup_of_July_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish coup of July 1936">Spanish coup of July 1936</a>,
Montseny supported the <a href="Republican_faction.md" class="wikilink"
title="Republican faction">Republican faction</a> against the
Nationalists, viewing a
<a href="united_front.md" class="wikilink" title="united front">united
front</a> of anti-fascists as necessary for advancing anarchism in
Spain.[^7] However, she quickly rejected the
<a href="Red_Terror_(Spain).md" class="wikilink"
title="violence in Republican-held territory">violence in
Republican-held territory</a>, describing it as "a lust for blood
inconceivable in honest man before".[^8]

In November 1936, <a href="Francisco_Largo_Caballero.md" class="wikilink"
title="Francisco Largo Caballero">Francisco Largo Caballero</a> invited
the anarchists to join the Spanish government. The anarchists were the
largest anti-fascist group, and other
<a href="Popular_Front.md" class="wikilink" title="Popular Front">Popular
Front</a> parties sought to neutralize their anti-statism.[^9] Montseny
later explained that the anarchists' principal concern in joining the
government was the rising power of the
<a href="Communist_Party_of_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party of Spain">Communist Party of Spain</a>, which
they viewed as a threat to the
<a href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolution">Revolution</a>.[^10]

Despite her own reservations about compromising anarchist principles,
Montseny accepted appointment as Minister of Health and Social
Assistance, becoming the first woman cabinet minister in Spanish
history.[^11][^12][^13]

From her ministerial position, Montseny oversaw medical facilities
overwhelmed by war conditions, organizing construction of orphanages and
provision of refugee aid.[^14][^15] She collaborated with
<a href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a> to advance women's rights through wide-ranging reforms
including: introduction of childcare for women workers and militia
members; provision of women's education and healthcare; and efforts to
combat prostitution.[^16]

Montseny persuaded anarchist militia leader
<a href="Buenaventura_Durruti.md" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a> to transfer from
the Aragon front to defend Madrid, where he fought and died at the
<a href="Battle_of_Ciudad_Universitaria.md" class="wikilink"
title="Battle of Ciudad Universitaria">Battle of Ciudad
Universitaria</a>.[^17]

During the
<a href="May_Days.md" class="wikilink" title="May Days">May Days</a> when
Barcelona anarchists revolted, Montseny appealed on behalf of the
government for militias to lay down arms.[^18][^19] When unsuccessful,
the government suppressed the anarchists by force in what Montseny
described as "the most terrible and bitter days of my life".[^20]

By the time
<a href="Juan_Negrin.md" class="wikilink" title="Juan Negrin">Juan
Negrin</a> consolidated power, Montseny believed the war was already
lost and focused on saving lives.[^21] She left the cabinet and
attempted to unite Republican forces, but by 1938 the deteriorating
situation forced her to focus on feeding her family.[^22]

### Exile and Continued Anarchist Organizing

In February 1939, Montseny and her family fled into exile as Nationalist
forces advanced into Catalonia.[^23][^24] Her mother died in Perpignan,
while her father was imprisoned and her husband held in an internment
camp.[^25] In her book *Pasión y Muerte de los Españoles refugiados en
Francia*, she documented how regulations in refugee organizations were
designed to defeat the spirit of Republican exiles and create obedient
slaves.[^26]

Initially relocating to Paris, Montseny helped resettle Spanish refugees
despite her own poverty.[^27] During the Nazi occupation of France, she
fled to Occitania where Vichy authorities detained her. Although they
had orders to extradite her to Francoist Spain, they released her
because she was pregnant.[^28][^29]

In 1942, the family attempted to relocate to Mexico, but war in North
Africa blocked their route and both Allies and Axis prevented further
emigration of Spanish refugees from France, forcing them to remain in
Toulouse.[^30]

Following France's liberation, Montseny participated in reorganizing the
CNT in exile and edited the organization's weekly newspaper.[^31] From
Toulouse, she wrote a weekly column in the French-language anarchist
newspaper *Espoir* and edited the journal
*<a href="Cénit.md" class="wikilink" title="Cénit">Cénit</a>*.[^32]

In 1968, she was one of the main delegates at the
<a href="Congress_of_Carrara.md" class="wikilink"
title="Congress of Carrara">Congress of Carrara</a>, a major
international anarchist congress. There she defended the foundation of
the <a href="International_of_Anarchist_Federations.md" class="wikilink"
title="International of Anarchist Federations">International of
Anarchist Federations</a> (IAF), demonstrating her continued commitment
to international anarchist organizing.[^33]

She briefly returned to Spain during the transition to democracy, when
her works were finally republished. Following the death of her youngest
daughter in 1977 and her husband in 1981, she penned an autobiography
published in 1987.[^34]

### Personal Life

In 1930, Montseny began a
<a href="free_love.md" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>
relationship with <a href="Germinal_Esgleas.md" class="wikilink"
title="Germinal Esgleas">Germinal Esgleas</a>.[^35] The couple had three
children together: daughter Vida (born 1933), son Germinal (born June
1938), and daughter Blanca (born 1941).[^36][^37]

She attempted to raise her daughters as "free women" and her son to
respect women, though she later remarked that traditional gender roles
proved difficult to overcome despite her efforts.[^38]

## Anarchist Theory

### Federalism

Montseny advocated for federalism consistent with anarchist principles
of decentralization, as practiced by both the CNT and FAI. In attempting
to reconcile anarchist anti-statism with the state socialism of the UGT,
she proposed federalism as a mechanism for collaboration among
anti-fascist forces, whereby each territory could organize its own
socialization process without following a single ideological line.

As she stated:

> "Politically, it is we, the members of the CNT, who have been the
> first to speak of what we consider a tacit condition for the true
> democratic structuring of Spain: a federal republic, with autonomous
> regions federated among themselves, forming a Socialist Republican
> Federation of Iberia."[^39]

## Death

Frederica Montseny died in Toulouse on 14 January 1994, at the age of
88.[^40]

## Legacy

Several streets, parks and schools are named in Montseny's memory
throughout Spain, especially in Catalonia, and in cities like
Paris.[^41] Her legacy represents both the possibilities and
contradictions of anarchist participation in government during
revolutionary periods, as well as the vital role of women in the Spanish
anarchist movement.
