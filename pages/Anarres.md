Anarres is the anarchist-run planet in Ursula K. Le Guin's novel
<a href="The_Dispossessed_(Ursula_K._Le_Guin).md" class="wikilink"
title="The Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>. About two hundred
years[^1] before the start of the plot, the neighboring capitalist
planet Urras had sent its anarchist rebels there, where they proceeded
to organize a society based on the anarchist theories of Odo. By the
time of the novel's events, Anarres has 20 million residents.[^2]

## Culture

Pravic, Anarres' language created by the early resident Fargiu[^3],
avoids possessive language except when explicitly talking about
possession or hierarchy. Instead of saying "my mother" and "my hand",
one says "the mother" and "the hand". Instead of saying "this one is
mine and that's yours," one says "I use this one and you use that
one."[^4] Post-anarchist critic Lewis Call praises the anarchistic
qualities of Pravic but also emphasizes and reiterates Le Guin's own
apparent criticism of Pravic's hyperrationalism, evident in its virtual
lack of swear words. "Language cannot be purely rational," Call remarks,
"for the humans who speak it certainly are not."[^5]

There is no gender hierarchy or gendered division of labor on
Anarres.[^6] All children experiment sexually with boys and girls.[^7]
The novel does not appear to mention genderqueer residents.[^8] Pravic
does not use possessive words for sex, except when describing rape. So,
someone says that two people "copulate", rather than saying one "fucks"
another.[^9] Adults typically live collectively in dormitories, singles
in single rooms and couples in double rooms. Partnerships can be
life-long, but there is no marriage.[^10]

There is no institutional religion on Anarres. The planet's residents
define religion as "the profoundest relationship man has with the
cosmos". For that reason, Shevek does not consider the planet's
residents to be non-religious or atheists.[^11]

As elaborated in the *Decisions* section, Anarrestis proclaim a rigorous
commitment to horizontal decision-making. However, Shevek's friend Bedap
believes Anarrestis have unwittingly built a tyranny of majority public
opinion: "We've let cooperation become obedience. On Urras they have
government by the minority. Here we have government by the majority. But
it is government." To illustrate, Bedap mentions his and Shevek's friend
Tirin, who wrote a play that audiences falsely construed as
authoritarian. Although Tirin had trained to be a math instructor, the
Division of Labor office repeatedly posted him only in manual labor
posts and refused to post him in math instruction as he preferred.[^12]

## Daily Life

Most Anarresti live collectively in dormitories, setting up bunks in
local facilities. Daily life typically involves meeting people at work,
in communal dining halls, and at various entertainments, forming both
friendly and romantic relationships. When focusing on deeper
relationships, individuals may take private rooms. Children are raised
in communal nurseries with as much or as little parental involvement as
desired.[^13]

Workers receive mentoring as needed and partner with others for
collaborative work, sometimes rotating between different jobs to
maintain interest. With work occupying only about 6 hours per day for
roughly 6 days out of every 10, substantial leisure time exists for
playing games and instruments, participating in amateur dramatics, or
simply conversing and being entertained. Some become delegates or serve
on councils as they become established in their work.[^14]

Nothing compels participation in communal life - an individual could
build a hut, collect food from distributories, and participate minimally
in society. However, such choices typically result in social pressure
through both direct comments and missed social opportunities from
reduced community involvement.[^15]

## Decisions

The Production and Distribution Coordination (PDC) administers economic
production based on the decisions of syndicates, federatives, productive
individuals and of administrators elected by lot for four years from a
pool of volunteers.[^16] The PDC has some authoritarian functions, such
as the monitoring and censoring of Anarrestis' communication to other
planets.[^17] Bedap argues that the PDC has become "an archistic
bureaucracy".[^18]

PDC meetings have no formal procedure, and they may be described as
somewhat chaotic. The typical PDC meeting "went very fast, several
people often speaking at once, nobody speaking at great length, a good
deal of sarcasm, a great deal left unsaid; the tone emotional, often
fiercely personal; an end was reached, yet there was no conclusion. It
was like an argument among brothers, or among thoughts in an undecided
mind."[^19]

In the city of Abbenay, there are about 200 semiautonomous
neighborhoods. It is not clear what exact mechanism, such as a council
or assembly, they use to make decisions.[^20] Federatives of communities
apparently communicate to the PDC "the priorities of each of the general
economy".[^21]

In a 1979 interview with *Reason*, the anarcho-communist Murray Bookchin
suggested that Anarres's PDC had too much power and communities had too
little:

> **REASON**: Have you read Ursula K. Le Guin's recent novel, The
> Dispossessed?
>
> **BOOKCHIN**: Yes.
>
> **REASON**: What do you think of the anarcho-communist society in that
> novel? Is it something of the sort that you would like?
>
> **BOOKCHIN**: No, it isn't. It's an anarcho-syndicalist society. And I
> think that Ursula Le Guin is conscious of the limitations of such a
> society. Anarcho-communism, or libertarian communism, is not
> anarcho-syndicalism. I feel close to the anarcho-syndicalists,
> primarily because they are antiauthoritarian, but I don't believe that
> society will be structured around factories or work places. I believe
> that a truly libertarian society will be structured around
> communities, not around economies: that the economy will merely become
> part of the community.
>
> What I think Ursula, whom I greatly admire—it's been my pleasure to
> have contact with her on a more than purely literary basis, in the
> sense that we've exchanged good vibes with each other—what I think
> Ursula is trying to demonstrate is that in such an anarcho-syndicalist
> society, or for that matter, in an anarcho-communist society, you can
> create a kind of tyranny in the name of the libertarian ideal.[^22]

## Economy

The Anarresti economy is based on usufruct, meaning any individual or
group has a right to use and occupy any land, building or materials that
are not already being used. There is no permanent ownership of anything
except for personal possessions. As Shevek was taught as a child,
"Nothing is yours. It is to use. It is to share. If you will not share
it, you cannot use it."[^23] One may take what they want from any of the
goods depositories,[^24] sleep in any of the dormitories, and eat at any
the cafeterias. The economy does not use currency.[^25]

On Anarres, human beings are thought to possess a "natural incentive to
work--his initiative, his spontaneous creative energy".[^26] In fact,
the Pravic language uses the same word for "work" and "play." If work is
coerced, hierarchical, or boring, then it is not considered work at all
but "kleggich," meaning drudgery.[^27] Some people work independently,
while others work at at worker-managed firms called syndicates. The
syndicates, in turn combine into regional and global federatives.[^28]
With computers, the PDC collects information on supply from the
producers and information on demand from the communities. The computers
use this information to calculate where labor, materials, and products
need to be sent.[^29]

The average person works 5 to 7 hours a day, on 2 to 4 days of out of
every 10.[^30] People request and receive job postings from the Division
of Labor office (DivLab). One may theoretically refuse their job
posting, but such refusal is rare in practice.[^31]. Some professions on
Anarres include farming, carpentry, sewage, playwriting, musical
instrument manufacture and repair, education and health care. Some
additional workplaces include a glassworks, wire factories, laundries,
and small-goods distributories.[^32] Through the transport federative,
workers provide free public transportation with trolleys, trains and
ships.[^33] The PDC requests that for one out of every ten days everyone
perform an undesirable job such as garbage collecting. One only performs
a dangerous job like mining for a half a year in their lifetime, and
people "take the dangerous, hard jobs because they take pride in doing
them, they can—egoize, we all it—show off?--to the weaker ones."[^34]

At learning centers, a class may be organized by students' initiative, a
teacher's initiative, or both.[^35] Children follow a curriculum that
introduces them to all of the adult's professions.[^36]

### Motivations

Anarresti are motivated to work through several interconnected factors
rather than economic coercion. These include a philosophical ethos of
altruism and cooperation derived from Odo's teachings, a sense that
their skills and contributions are needed by the community, and the
social vocabulary of Pravic which focuses less on individual possession.
Additionally, Anarresti feel a sense of responsibility to others who
rely upon them, maintain associations with fellow workers, care about
their social reputation and avoiding criticism, and experience a sense
of achievement from doing work well and being appreciated.[^37]

### Choosing Work

For those without specific preferences, finding work typically involves
going to DivLab to see available postings, choosing work that keeps them
near familiar people and places or alternatively provides new
experiences, volunteering for a posting, and then relocating as needed.
Those with specialized practical skills follow a similar process but
with more focused opportunities that may require more flexibility in
location.[^38]

Creative workers gravitate toward environments that foster their talents
or provide desired audiences and reach. Research workers seek institutes
conducting similar research or possessing needed resources. Those
working in new areas may need to establish new departments, secure
resources, and work with publishers to disseminate results. While
researchers cannot be stopped from pursuing their chosen work, they also
cannot compel others to assist them - they must convince others of their
work's importance to gain collaborators and form new syndicates.[^39]

## Environment

Anarres apparently has a zero-waste economy, as Shevek is surprised to
see people from the neighboring planet Urras produce waste without
intending to reuse it.[^40] The city of Abbenay runs on wind and
geothermal power, and residents turn off the heat when the outside
temperature rises above 55 degrees Fahrenheit.[^41] Soon after the
initial settlement on Anarres, almost eighteen thousand residents spent
two years planting trees in the West Temaenian Littoral.[^42]

Freighters from Urras bring fossil fuels to Anarres and exchange them
for metals, uranium and gold. Anarres continues trading with Urras, in
part out of fear that Urras would otherwise invade Anarres for
resources.[^43]

## Crime

When someone neglects their share of work or causes harm to others, they
get reprimanded, shunned and sometimes even beaten up by their
neighbors. In a small community, an uncooperative person may be taken
off of the meal listings, and he will therefore have to cook and eat
meals by himself.[^44] If a rapist does not quickly get to a therapy
center, he is likely to face quick revenge from the victim's
neighbors.[^45] Because there are no class divisions and one can take
what they want from a goods distributory, there is little incidence of
theft. "As for violence," Shevek explains, "well, I don't know Oiie;
would you murder me ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law
against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining
order."[^46]

There are no prisons on Anarres[^47], although people are sometimes
heavily pressured to go to the Asylum on Segvina Island, which arguably
functions as a prison.[^48]

## Revolution

In 740, workers on Urras rose up in an anarchist revolution based on the
theories of Odo. In 771, Urras sent its Odonian rebels of Urras to
Anarres, where they proceeded to build an anarchist society. Most of the
Usratti miners who had settled on Anarres in 738 chose to return to
Urras.[^49] According to Shevek, all Anarrestis are permanent
revolutionaries.[^50]

## Neighboring Societies

Anarres has a distrustful relationship with other planets and even has a
law against any Urrasiti landing anywhere on Anarres except for the
landing port where trade occurs.[^51] The PDC coordinates a Defense
Federative.[^52]

*Wikipedia* describes a neocolonial situation between Urras and Anarres:

"The economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to
Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being
free and independent, having broken off from the political and social
influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider
Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual
consignment of Anarres's precious metals and their distribution to major
powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world."[^53]

### Comparison with Urras

While the capitalist planet Urras, particularly the nation of A-Io,
provides certain luxuries unavailable on Anarres, these come at severe
cost. The Urrasti system requires an exploited class working in
sweatshops, mines, and factories under dangerous conditions for long
hours and minimal or no pay. Shevek observes that in Urrasti markets,
"none of the millions of things for sale were made there. They were only
sold there. Where were the workshops, the factories, where were the
farmers, the craftsmen, the miners, the weavers, the chemists, the
carvers, the dyers, the designers, the machinists, where were the hands,
the people who made? Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls."[^54]

Even affluent Urrasti citizens face dependence on wage labor, with
access to housing, food, and society dependent on the threat of
homelessness and starvation. This system is overseen by property owners,
supporting politicians, and arbitrarily appointed managers, enabling a
small class to profit from others' labor while maintaining compliance
through police and imprisonment. As Shevek reflects, the law on Urras
"seemed to be property, or power, or maybe just force," in stark
contrast to Anarres's foundation in "mutual aid, solidarity, the common
good."[^55]

While Anarres faces scarcity and hardship, and social pressure can risk
conformity, the burdens and benefits are shared by all. Work represents
voluntary contribution rather than coerced necessity, and social
pressure lacks the backing of state violence or economic deprivation
that characterizes Urrasti society.[^56]
