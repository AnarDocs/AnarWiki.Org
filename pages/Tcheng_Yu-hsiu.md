## Life

### Early Life

Tcheng was born on March 20, 1891, in Xin'an County, Guangdong,
China.[^1] She was raised in the paternal family home in Guangdong and
was at first home-schooled before her mother enrolled her at a formal
school in
"<a   href="Beijing.md" class="wikilink" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>.

Her revolutionary activities began at a young age. She refused to have
her feet bound as she saw how the traditional practice had affected her
mother who underwent the binding process as a child.[^2] She also
refused a marriage arranged by her paternal grandmother because she
thought her fiance's conservative upbringing and beliefs would be too
incompatible with her own lifestyle.[^3]

Her family sent her to a mission school in Tianjin, where she learned
English but chose not to follow the religious instruction.

### Political Radicalisation

In 1912, she met the anarchist and revolutionary organizer
"<a   href="Li_Shizeng.md" class="wikilink" title="Li Shizeng">Li Shizeng</a>
and enrolled in his preparatory school for Chinese students hoping to go
to France on the Diligent Work Frugal Study program. The school was the
first in China to be co-educational. She was one of the handful of women
to go to
"<a   href="French_Republic.md" class="wikilink" title="France">France</a> on
the program.[^4]

#### The Revolution of 1911

Tcheng was a member of the
"<a   href="Kuomintang.md" class="wikilink" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>,
the Nationalist Party of China. After meeting the party's leader
"<a   href="Sun_Yat-sen.md" class="wikilink" title="Sun Yat-sen">Sun
Yat-sen</a>, she dedicated herself to the revolutionary cause.[^5] As a
member of a revolutionary cell, Tcheng hid bombs in her suitcases to
transport them to Beijing with the intention of using them against
officials working for the Manchu dynasty.[^6] Later she was involved in
the attempted assassination of Yuan Shikai, who had taken power from Sun
Yat-sen.[^7] She fled to France after being notified that she was wanted
for arrest by the government for her involvement with the planned
attacks.[^8]

#### World War I

By 1914, she had established herself in Paris, where historians believe
she met other political figures, such as her fellow party member Wang
Jingwei.[^9] It was difficult for Tcheng to adjust to her new life in
France as she was not fluent in the language, but later on she
considered the country to be similar to China in terms of political
aspirations and in spirit.[^10]

She remained in France for the remainder of World War I and pursued an
education in law at the University of Paris, the Sorbonne, enrolling a
year into the war. She urged China to ally itself with the Allied
Powers. China entered the war in 1917. Tcheng was invited to speak at a
meeting held at the Sorbonne and acted as a spokesperson for her native
country, with the French minister of war present at this meeting.[^11]

Tcheng returned to China after 1917 to advocate for Chinese aid to the
Allied war effort. Over 100,000 Chinese men volunteered for labor
service to support France in combat.[^12]

#### Paris Peace Conference

In 1919, due to her involvement in the 1911 Revolution and her French
and English language skills, Tcheng was appointed as the sole female
Chinese delegate for the Paris Peace Conference along with chief
plenipotentiary Lu Zhengxiang and other male delegates selected by the
Beijing Government and the Nationalists.[^13] Tcheng was chosen as a
delegate so that she would act as the voice of Chinese women and take
charge of communication between the delegation and the media. Her image
was starkly different to the Western perception of Chinese women, which
in turn helped to change Westerners' view of China as well.[^14]

She traveled to the "<a   href="United_States_of_America.md" class="wikilink"
title="United States">United States</a> after the war in hopes of
gaining allies in China's quest for sovereignty. President Woodrow
Wilson's Fourteen Points speech gave China reason to believe that the
United States would be supportive of their goals.[^15] However, at the
Paris Peace Conference, it was proven otherwise. The United States was
in favor of granting Shandong to Japan in fear of agitating the nation.
This decision was thought of as a betrayal in the eyes of Chinese
nationals.[^16]

##### Rosebush Gun Incident

Tcheng was very critical of the Shandong decision. She joined with
Chinese students at home and abroad in protesting the signing of the
Versailles Treaty in the belief that this agreement would encourage
Japan to further reduce Chinese sovereignty.[^17] Due to mounting
pressure from Chinese students and workers, chief delegate Lu Zhengxiang
slipped out of Paris on June 27, 1919, on the eve of the signing
ceremony. He was rumored to be in the Parisian suburb of St. Cloud en
route to signing the agreement.[^18]

Upon discovering Lu's location, Tcheng and her accomplices traveled to
the St. Cloud residence to demand Lu refuse to sign the treaty. Lu
refused to open the door, but a secretary carrying a briefcase dashed
from the residence towards his car. Sensing something was amiss, Tcheng
broke off a rosebush branch roughly shaped like a gun and rubbed it with
dirt.[^19] In her memoir she states: "I stepped out of the shadows in
front of him and pointed my rosebush gun right at him. He was so
frightened that he inadvertently dropped the portfolio from his arm and
immediately took flight."[^20]

Tcheng and her group stood vigil throughout the night. The next morning
Lu heard them out and bent to their will. On June 28, 1919, China would
be the only Allied nation to not sign the Treaty of Versailles. Tcheng
kept the rosebush gun as a historical memento and took it back to her
family home in Shanghai, China, hiding it away in a drawer wrapped in a
white cloth. The rosebush would sadly vanish when the Japanese looted
her family home during World War II in 1937.

### Later Life

Tcheng received her law doctorate from the Faculty of Law of Paris in
1926. She and her fellow law student and legal partner Wei Tao-ming
established a law practice in Shanghai. In the late 1920s, Tcheng and
Wei married. In the late 1920s, she briefly became a judge in a French
concession court, becoming the first female judge in
"<a   href="People&#39;s_Republic_of_China.md" class="wikilink"
title="China">China</a>.[^21]

Tcheng advocated for women to have a choice in their marriages and to
have the right to divorce. She wrote these rights into the Republic of
China's Civil Code in the early 1930s.[^22] She was president of a court
in the French concession and then served in the national Legislative
Yuan, helping to draft the Chinese Republican-era civil code. From 1931
to 1937 she was president of University of Shanghai school of law.[^23]

Her autobiography, *My Revolutionary Years* (1944), published while her
husband was Ambassador to the United States, is a first-hand account of
modern Chinese history and has been translated into many languages.

She died of cancer in Los Angeles on December 16, 1959.[^24]

## Influences

Tcheng was one of the influences who inspired Phan Bội Châu's
development of women's rights in Vietnam.[^25]
