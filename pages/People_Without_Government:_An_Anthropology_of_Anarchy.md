# People Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy

## Overview

**People Without Government: An Anthropology of Anarchy** is a
comprehensive anthropological examination of
"<a   href="anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchic societies">anarchic
societies</a> throughout history and across cultures. Written by Harold
Barclay, the work challenges the common misconception that anarchy
equates to chaos by documenting numerous stateless societies that
function effectively without formal governmental structures. The book
draws on extensive ethnographic research to demonstrate that anarchy is
not only viable but likely represents the oldest form of political
organisation in human history.

The work distinguishes between anarchy as a societal condition (absence
of rulers and government) and
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> as
a 19th-century political philosophy advocating for individual freedom
and the abolition of oppressive institutions. Through detailed case
studies spanning hunter-gatherer, horticultural, pastoral, and
agricultural societies, Barclay illustrates how diverse communities
maintain social order through diffuse sanctions, religious sanctions,
and voluntary cooperation rather than legal coercion.

## Summary

### Theoretical Framework

Barclay establishes a clear distinction between **anarchy** and
**anarchism**. Anarchy refers to societies without rulers or government,
often found among what are termed "archaic" or "primitive" peoples.
Anarchism, by contrast, is a conscious political theory developed in
19th-century Europe that values human freedom and individuality whilst
advocating for the abolition of oppressive institutions including
government, the state, the Church, and patriarchal family structures.

The author argues that all human societies require order and structure
for survival, but anarchism questions the source of that order. Rather
than opposing organisation itself, anarchist thought concerns itself
with limiting power and maximising its diffusion throughout society. The
work emphasises that anarchism accepts rational authority based on
competence whilst rejecting irrational authority based on power over
people.

### Social Control Mechanisms

The book examines three primary types of social sanctions:

**Diffuse Sanctions** are spontaneously applied by any community members
and include gossip, name-calling, arguing, physical confrontation,
ostracism, duelling, and ritualised competitions. These sanctions are
universal and particularly effective in small, closely-knit communities
where responsibility for enforcement is spread throughout the group.

**Religious Sanctions** involve supernatural elements such as curses,
threats of eternal punishment, or automatic divine retribution for rule
infractions. Some require human executors whilst others are seen as
automatic, coming directly from deities or spiritual forces.

**Legal Sanctions** represent expressions of approval or disapproval
delegated to specific roles with monopolies on violence enforcement.
These exist only where government and state apparatus are present,
distinguishing anarchic societies which rely exclusively on diffuse and
certain supernatural sanctions.

### Case Studies by Subsistence Mode

#### Hunter-Gatherer Societies

The **"<a   href="Inuit.md" class="wikilink" title="Inuit">Inuit</a>**
exemplify "primitive anarchy" with informal leadership based on ability
rather than coercion. Leaders called "isumataq" ('he who thinks') are
recognised for hunting prowess and wisdom but cannot compel obedience.
Order is maintained through open discussion seeking consensus, with
dissenting parties free to separate. Conflict resolution involves
diffuse sanctions including ostracism, ridicule, and song competitions
where opponents insult each other before community judges.

The **"<a   href="San_people.md" class="wikilink" title="San">San</a>**
organise into loosely structured bands without formal leaders, though
"owners" of land around water holes hold influence through kinship ties.
Physical combat is immediately interrupted by relatives, followed by
extended discussion aimed at resolution. Severe conflicts often result
in group splitting rather than continued confrontation.

**"<a   href="Pygmy_peoples.md" class="wikilink" title="Pygmies">Pygmies</a>**
strongly avoid personal authority, viewing responsibility as communal
with "the forest itself" acting as chief and arbitrator. Decision-making
involves casual, informal discussions with all adult males until
agreement is reached, whilst women participate by offering opinions.

#### Horticultural Societies

The
**"<a   href="Lugbara_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Lugbara">Lugbara</a>**
demonstrate political decentralisation through segmentary lineage
systems. Elders possess ritual authority through invoking ancestral
ghosts who influence descendants, whilst "men whose names are known" act
as mediators in disputes between lineages. Religious sanctions through
ancestral spirits serve as the primary form of social control.

**"<a   href="Tiv_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Tiv">Tiv</a>** society
features compound elders who settle quarrels through mediation rather
than enforcement. Age sets provide mutual aid and protection across
lineage lines, whilst market places represent limited governmental
functions through lineage segments controlling market magic and
providing police and judges.

The **"<a   href="Ibo_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Ibo">Ibo</a>**
exhibit a "multicentric power system" with village elders forming
deliberative, legislative, judicial, and executive bodies. Younger
age-grade members act as enforcers for community decisions, whilst
titled men's associations and religious specialists exert significant
influence.

#### Pastoral Societies

The **"<a   href="Nuer_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Nuer">Nuer</a>**
represent a famous example of segmentary patrilineal organisation
without government. The leopard skin chief serves as ritual specialist
and mediator who encourages blood money payments and threatens curses
but lacks true judicial or enforcement powers. Feuding between segments
functions as the primary political mechanism for maintaining balance.

**"<a   href="Sami_people.md" class="wikilink" title="Samek">Samek</a>
(Lapps)** organise as reindeer herders with individualistic worldviews
and anarchic social structures. Small, independent bands make collective
decisions through adult male councils, whilst band leaders coordinate
economic activities but possess limited authority outside herd
management.

#### Agricultural Societies

**Ancient
"<a   href="Iceland.md" class="wikilink" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>**
developed a confederation of independent chiefdoms where godhis (chiefs)
mediated disputes but lacked police forces, depending entirely on
followers' goodwill. Assemblies called "Things" legislated and acted as
courts but could not enforce decisions, leading enforcement to rely on
public willingness or aggrieved parties pursuing feuds.

**"<a   href="Berbers.md" class="wikilink" title="Imazighen (Berbers)">Imazighen
(Berbers)</a>** maintain highly decentralised polities based on
patrilineages. Village councils composed of lineage spokespersons decide
matters through unanimous consensus, enforcing decisions via banishment
or ostracism backed by public opinion.

Modern
**"<a   href="Anabaptist.md" class="wikilink" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a>**
sects including
"<a   href="Mennonites.md" class="wikilink" title="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>,
"<a   href="Amish.md" class="wikilink" title="Amish">Amish</a>, and
"<a   href="Hutterites.md" class="wikilink" title="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>
practice anarchy within state systems. These religious communities
reject state participation as un-Christian, governing themselves through
congregational decisions with "disfellowshiping" (expulsion and
shunning) as ultimate punishment.

### Modern Anarchist Experiments

The book examines intentional anarchist communities including the
**Ukrainian Anarchist Movement** under
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a> (1918-1919), which aimed for communal ownership and voluntary
administration but faced contradictions due to wartime conditions and
Makhno's own authoritarian proclamations.

The **"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a>** (1936-1939)
represented the largest anarchist movement with mass support.
Collectives promoted communal ownership, voluntary membership, and equal
pay, though decisions often relied on majority vote rather than
consensus, raising questions about minority rights and potential
coercive elements.

Various **intentional communities** such as Josiah Warren's experiments
(Equity, Utopia, Modern Times) and other anarchist colonies faced
challenges from external pressures including laws, economic dependence,
and cultural conditioning, though some succeeded through careful member
screening and loosely structured communal organisation.

## Key Insights

### Viability of Large-Scale Anarchy

Contrary to assumptions that anarchy only functions in small groups,
examples including the Tiv, Lugbara, Nuer, and Tonga demonstrate that
populations of hundreds of thousands can function anarchically through
complex segmentary lineage systems or cross-cutting social ties without
centralised coordination.

### Leadership Types in Anarchic Societies

Barclay identifies several leadership patterns: **Big Men** who gain
influence through wealth and persuasion; **Technicians** who achieve
prominence through skills; **Holy Men** accepted for religious
authority; and **Old Men** holding senior positions in kinship groups.
The most successful leaders operate through reciprocal relations rather
than commanding obedience.

### Decision-Making Processes

Anarchic societies typically favour consensus over majority voting,
viewing the latter as a "subterfuge" that creates illusions of control
whilst compelling minority conformity. Consensus, despite being
time-consuming, better protects minority rights and ensures genuine
agreement rather than mere compliance.

### Social Order Without State Violence

The work argues that whilst diffuse and religious sanctions can be harsh
(including ostracism, physical violence, and supernatural threats), they
remain less systematically oppressive than state tyrannies enhanced by
modern technology. Feuding systems aim to "even scores" and restore
balance rather than achieve total victory, often functioning as social
control mechanisms encouraging self-restraint.

## Critiques

Barclay acknowledges that anarchic societies are not without problems.
Informal tyrannies can emerge, particularly through "Big Man" systems
where influential individuals accumulate excessive power. Some
traditional societies also perpetuate forms of oppression including
patriarchal control and rigid social hierarchies that anarchist theory
would reject.

The author notes the historical trend toward larger, more centralised
states, suggesting that anarchic polities are becoming "a dying breed."
This supports Michels' "iron law of oligarchy," whereby organisations
tend toward authoritarianism over time, though specific conditions might
allow some groups to avoid this trajectory.

### Contemporary Relevance

The work concludes with an "anarcho-cynicalist" perspective, suggesting
that whilst centralisation continues largely unabated and "power abhors
a vacuum," humans retain some control over their destiny and can modify
social order. The struggle for liberty is characterised as perpetual,
requiring constant vigilance rather than expecting final victory.
