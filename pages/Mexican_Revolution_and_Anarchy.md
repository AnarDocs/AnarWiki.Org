On 1 July 1906, the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM, Mexican Liberal
Party) issued a platform. Contrary to what the PLM’s name suggested, the
organization held Anarchist politics opposed to the state, capitalism,
and other forms of coercive hierarchy. While the PLM’s 1906 platform did
not actually call for a radical utopia, it demanded reforms so
far-reaching for the context—during Porfirio Díaz’s dictatorship—that
their implementation arguably required a revolutionary situation. For
example, the platform insisted on a maximum eight-hour workday and
minimum salary, the restoration of ejidos (communally-held farmlands),
and public education for people under fourteen. Four years later, a
revolution did occur, and it produced a new Constitution in 1917
guaranteeing all the demands enumerated above. Remarkably, the
Constitution fully implemented twenty-three of the PLM’s fifty-two
demands, and it partially implemented another twenty-six.[^1] In total,
then, some forty-nine out of these Anarchists’ fifty-two demands in 1906
made their way, in some shape or form, into Mexico’s 1917 national
constitution.

The first social revolution since the emergence of Anarchism as a
political movement, the 1910 Mexican Revolution involved significant
Anarchist activity, led by the Anarcho-communist PLM, the
Anarcho-syndicalist House of the World Worker (COM), and the
Anarchist-influenced Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Industrial
Union of North and South America (UIANS), and the Liberation Army of the
South (ELS). The Revolution began as an uprising led by the liberal
Fransisco Madero against the dictator Porfirio Díaz. Díaz resigned and
went into exile in 1911, but the revolution continued until at least
1920, by which time it had become a civil war between multiple factions.
Mexico's 1917 Constitution was one of the major outcomes of the Mexican
Revolution.

# Anarchist precursors

Anarchists, rather than Marxists, dominated the anti-capitalist labor
movement of Mexico from the 1880s to 1920. As Barry Carr notes,
“Historians of twentieth-century Mexico generally agree that Marxism
contributed little and late to the Mexican workers' movement \[…\] The
dominant ideological strands informing Mexican worker activities in the
forty years before the 1910 Revolution were various versions of
anarchism, libertarianism, and radical liberalism.”[^2] Ángel J.
Cappelletti observes that in the 1870s “Mexican anarchists encouraged
cooperativism and collectivism, supported a struggle in the workers’ and
artisans’ organizations...and promoted the syndicalist struggle through
the proletarian press.”[^3] During this decade, Mexican Anarchism’s
leading spokesperson was José María González, who wrote: “The Social
Revolution/ What is the Object of that revolution?/ To abolish the
proletariat./ Then, cannot the government pass laws to bring about this
goal?/ The government is unable to do anything./ Why?/ Because it is the
first enslaver.”[^4]

# Mexican Liberal Party (PLM)

In 1903, the brothers Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magón fled Mexico to
the United States due to frequent arrests and police surveillance. They
published the paper Regeneracion, and in 1905, they announced the
establishment of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM). Despite its name, the
Party espoused revolutionary Anarchism. In 1905, the PLM's newspaper
Regeneracion sold 200,000 copies each edition.[^5] At an early age,
Ricardo Flores Magón read the Russian Anarchist writer Peter Kropotkin,
and he began to openly support Anarchism in 1906. Within the PLM,
Ricardo became the organization’s president, and his brother Enrique
became the treasurer. “Between 1900 and 1910, Magón and the Liberal
party were the only serious challenge to the Díaz regime and they became
a symbol of resistance,” John Hart observes.[^6]

The Party consisted of decentralized guerrilla units, each with about
fifty members on average. Some units, however, had two hundred to three
hundred members. Despite this partially decentralized structure, the
Party did not avoid the hierarchical trappings of a military
organization. Each unit elected a *jefe* and *subjefe*, who in turn
reported to clandestine *delgados*. The PLM divided Mexico into five
zones, and each zone had a *delgado*. Finally, the delgados reported to
the revolutionary *Junta*.[^7]

The PLM conducted a series of strikes and raids from 1906 to 1908, but
their most important was probably in 1911, during the Revolution’s
beginning stages, when they established military control of Baja
California for six months, “establishing a commune." “\[A\]n
internationalist and multi-racial coalition of PLM units, Anglo members
of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), ‘committed anarchists’,
‘adventurers’, and African American and indigenous fighters had
liberated Tijuana and Mexicali from Porfirian control.”[^8] Madero’s
forces ultimately crushed the PLM’s campaign, and the PLM’s influence
waned afterwards. Still, it was a major episode of temporary regional
autonomy that happened within the Revolution’s duration. Perhaps the
PLM’s most lasting influence in Mexico, though, was on the Zapatistas
and the House of the Global Worker.

The PLM's 1 July 1906 platform influenced the central demands by the
country's urban and rural labor movements. The PLM's platform issued
various fifty-two demands, including a minimum wage, a reduced work-day,
and redistribution of rural lands. As James Cockroft writes, the labor
section of the PLM platform “would be adopted in great part by the major
labor movement of the Mexican Revolution”. The Zapatistas' Plan of Ayala
“contained some fairly obvious allusions to earlier PLM rhetoric,”
including an ending—“Liberty, justice, and law”—that resembled the PLM
slogan “Reform, Justice, and Law”.[^9] In 1917, the government of
President Venustiano Carranza issued a new Constitution of Mexico, which
fully met twenty-three of the PLM platform's demands and partially met
an additional twenty-six.[^10]

# Zapatistas

The Zapatistas, a movement of rural small farmers that began in the
state of Morelos under the leadership of Emiliano Zapata, exhibited many
anarchistic qualities and drew direct inspiration from Mexican
Anarchists. John Womack writes that the Zapatistas were “ignorant of
theory but nevertheless compelled, towards the construction of an
agrarian anarcho-communism.”[^11] Actually, the Zapatistas were not
ignorant of theory but rather developed their theory in conversation
with Anarchism. Zapata adopted the Anarchist motto “Tierra y libertad”
(land and freedom), and José Muñoz Cota reported that Ricardo Flores
Magón himself suggested that slogan, through a messenger, to Zapata. The
secretary of Zapata’s army, Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama, was an Anarchist
who supported Flores Magón’s ideas and who had previously been in the
PLM.[^12] What is certain is that the Plan de Ayala adopted a number of
ideas from the PLM and “incorporated phrases” directly from the PLM’s
newspaper *Regeneración*.[^13] Some Anarchist members of House of the
World Worker went on to join the Zapatista movement, including Antonio
Diaz Soto y Gama who served as the Zapatistas' secretary, Rafael Perez
Taylor, Luis Mendez, Miguel Mendoza Lopez Schwerdtfeger, and Octavio
Jahn.[^14]

On 28 November 1911, Zapata proclaimed the Plan of Ayala, a framework
for land redistribution and local political autonomy. Ángel Cappelletti
speculates that Soto y Gama may have authored Zapata’s 11 November 1911
Plan de Ayala, a sweeping agrarian reform platform that called for the
restoration of ejidos.[^15] The historian John Hart argues that the Plan
of Ayala had roots in a long agrarian radical tradition largely shaped
by Anarchist organizers. For instance, Hart mentions Jose Maria
Gonzalez, an early organizer and spokesperson of agrarian Anarchism in
Mexico. At one point Gonzalez wrote, using quite explicitly anti-statist
language: “The Social Revolution. What is the Object of that revolution?
To abolish the proletariat. Then cannot the government pass laws to
bring about this goal. The government is unable to do anything.”[^16]
Alan Knight asserts that “Zapatismo approached the Proudhonian ideal, a
society marked not by the total dissolution of order and structure, but
by the resurgence of small, local social units (families, clans,
villages) enjoying self-government and linked in a loose, voluntary
formation.”[^17] According to Adolfo Gilly, the Plan of Ayala, while not
consciously socialist, “\[if implemented\] would have effectively
smashed the living roots of capitalism. For it would have involved
nationalization of all the property of the exploiting classes.”[^18]

The Zapatistas had two main organizations: a military called the
Liberation Army of the South, with 70,000 militants in 1915, and a
civilian organization called the Industrial Union of North and South
America.[^19] John Womack's *Zapata and the Mexican Revolution*
demonstrates that the Zapatistas organized themselves in a decentralized
manner with a minimal amount of coercive hierarchies among the men (the
region was also historically a site of patriarchal local and Catholic
traditions). Womack explains the way that Emiliano Zapata's leadership
rested on popular consensus rather than authoritarianism: “Zapata is
most prominent in these pages not because he himself begged attention
but because the villagers of Morelos put him in charge and persistently
looked to him for guidance, and because other villagers around the
Republic took him for their champion.”[^20] Within their territories,
the Zapatistas minimized the use of centralized force, preferring to
settle conflicts at the community level. Womack writes that “Zapata
never organized a state police: law enforcement, such as it was,
remained the province of village councils.”[^21]

Jason Wehling describes the military structure as “agrarian
communalist”, referring to the significant degree of autonomy that each
locally-based unit enjoyed. He explains, citing Womack and Friedrich
Katz: “While Zapata was responsible for specifying operations, the
overall structure of command was relatively decentralized. This worked
very well \[…\] The entire military organization was tied, intimately,
with the local communities. The actual guerrilla units were fairly
small, usually composed of only 200 to 300 men each. But this was the
result of where the base originated: the villages.” Wehling describes
the Zapatistas' social structure as “libertarian municipalist,”
referring to the philosophy developed by Murray Bookchin, a
Vermont-based green Anarchist. Wehling claims, “the
Libertarian-Municipalism that was instituted in the villages under
Zapatista control was very close to the Anarchist ideal.” Specifically,
towns were liberated from most aspects of state and federal authority.
The territories' General Law mandated a one-year term-limit for
political office-holder, to prevent the development of a class of
professional politicians.[^22]

# House of the World Worker (COM)

House of the World Worker (COM) was a large urban-based union founded in
1912 with strong Anarcho-syndicalist leanings. COM became “the
omnipotent labor organization in Mexico” by early 1913, according to
Hart. They led many strikes across the country, including a strike at
Mexico City's Cafe Ingles, which forced management to concede to
workers' demands. COM also organized an Escuela Racionalista and other
community schools that taught workers literacy and spread revolutionary
propaganda.[^23] At first, the union’s name was simply La Casa del
Obrero, but they added Mundial in 1913 after hearing a rousing speech by
Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama. COM took many forms of direct action: “tailors
organized a boycott of the Palacio de Hierro, and textile workers called
strikes in factories in Colmena Miraflores, and other places,” for
example.[^24]

# Anarchists' Collusion with Carranza

The COM became hugely influential especially in Mexico City, and some
scholars speculate that if they had allied with the Zapatistas, the
alliance could have shifted the Revolution in a more (libertarian)
socialist direction. Smolski et al argue, “\[T\]he failure of the
proletarians \[especially the COM\] and peasants \[especially the
Zapatistas\] to unite in Mexico led to the establishment of a caudillo
order.”[^25] Stuart Easterling also notes that such an alliance between
proletarians and peasants would have “at the minimum” weakened the
Constitutionalists’ ability to consolidate the state along highly
capitalist and authoritarian lines: “\[W\]hat if workers and their
unions had cemented an alliance with the other side, with Villa and
Zapata? It would have dealt a serious blow to Obregón’s efforts, and he
knew this. At minimum, it might have been difficult for him to maintain
his military rear guard and his supply lines while he challenged Villa.
But even more important, Obregón’s plans for national control would have
proved a difficult proposition if he had faced the active (if not armed)
opposition of the working class of the capital.”[^26]

However, the COM did not align with Zapata but instead aligned with the
Constitutionalists. They even organized “Red Battalions” that help the
government fight the Zapatistas. Easterling points out tactical reasons
COM might have made this choice. The Constitutionalists had consistently
showed some interest in urban labor issues, and the rural Zapatistas had
not. The Constitutionalists seemed to be interested in nation-wide
issues, whereas the Zapatistas were much more provincially focused. Less
significant of a factor (according to Easterling), COM’s strongly
anti-clerical outlook prejudiced the organization against the highly
religious campesinos.[^27] Hart argues that the COM's reason for siding
against the Zapatistas had to do with cultural factors. COM members
prided themselves on their urban identity and saw themselves as more
culturally advanced than the rural Zapatista farmers. Furthermore, the
COM had a purist rejection of religion and thus frowned on the
Zapatistas' Catholicism. Finally, the COM was unimpressed by Zapata and
Villa's 1914 invasion of Mexico City: “\[T\]he Casa directors witnessed
what they considered a pitiful spectacle as the Zapatista troops humbly
begged tortillas on the doorsteps of 'bourgeois homes',” writes Hart
based on interviews.[^28]

At the time, Ricardo Flores Magón denounced in the strongest possible
terms COM’s alliance with the Constitutionalists: “By taking arms
against the workers of the fields, you have taken arms against your own
interests, because the interests of the exploited are the same whether
they use the plough or the hammer. You have shot down your class
brothers, the Zapatistas and the anarchists of the Mexican Liberal
Party, with impunity, but in this way you have strengthened the enemy,
the bourgeoisie, who today are paying for your services with misery, and
when you protest, death!”[^29] From this point of view, the COM’s own
missteps may have helped seal the ultimately conservative direction of
the Revolution (not to mention the government’s ultimate repression of
the COM themselves).

In 1919, a contingent of Constitutionalists set up a meeting with
Zapata, falsely claiming a desire to defect to the Zapatistas. At the
meeting, they assassinated Zapata. The government ended up outlawing the
COM, and the Anarchist movement deteriorated after 1920.
