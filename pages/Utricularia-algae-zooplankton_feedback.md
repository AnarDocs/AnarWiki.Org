Utricularia are a genus of carnivorous marine plants covered in algae.
Zooplankton eat the algae, and the Utricularia suck in the zooplankton,
through bladder traps, and consume them. The biologist Robert Ulanowicz
describes the relationship between Utricularia, algae and zooplankton as
an example of *autocatalysis*, meaning "a particular form of positive
feedback wherein the effect of every consecutive link in the feedback
loop is positive."

- The more zooplankton that the plant consumes, the more it grows.
- The more the plant grows, the more algae-covered surface there is for
  zooplankton to eat.
- The more algae-covered surface there is, the more zooplankton there is
  for the plant to consume.[^1]
