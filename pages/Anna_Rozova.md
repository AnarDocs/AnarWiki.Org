## Biography

Anna was born in Buinsk, Simbirsk, Russia. She worked as a nurse in the
Voykov sanatorium in Yalta and was a member of the Komsomol - the
Communist Party youth organisation. Her brother Andrei was an anarchist
who was arrested several times, and Anna became disillusioned with the
Bolsheviks. She moved to Moscow in 1923 and resigned from the Komsomol.
She had announced her intentions to join the anarchists at a meeting,
and was arrested by the OGPU (secret police) on 28 February, being
sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment in the "special purpose camp" on
the Solovetsky islands in the White Sea. She went on hunger strike for
43 days in protest, but she was forced to serve her full sentence. She
was later exiled to Kem for 3 years. She was arrested again during her
exile on 18 November, 1926 for being in contact with anarchists and
being in possession of anti-Soviet poems. She was sentenced for 3 more
years in the Solovetsky camp, and at this point she had a young child.
She was released early in October 1928 and exiled to the Kansk district
in Siberia, then sent to Svobodny in the Amur region in January 1930.
She was arrested again for trying to escape from exile and imprisoned
for three years in a prison camp from 1931. This was her final sentence
and by the late 1960s she was living in Ulyanovsk.
