## Overview

Horizom Anarchism is the idea of poet and writer
<a href="Dalependell.com" class="wikilink" title="Dale Pendell">Dale
Pendell</a>, which views the current paradigms of self-centered progress
and resource exploitation to naturally fall upon itself. As a result of
this, horizon anarchists are affirmed in their projects of a
life-affirming sense of neo-activism where one's lived life itself is a
form of sowing the seeds that will ensure the eventual proliferation of
the core tenet of Anarchism : "the presence of rules, with no rulers" --
a view of society without arbitrary infantilisation. As horizon
anarchists we believe that "the Horizon will bear fruits", and thus
proceed to deal with the present reality in a view of knowing that a
system that values profits over peopl can not last, and though may take
lifetimes, the revolution will come. Thus, Horizon Anarchists do to the
core of their potential and thence pass on the torch.

## Origins

Horizon Anarchism emerged from a 2006 lecture by Dale Pendell at the
Palenque Norte gathering at
<a href="Burning_Man" class="wikilink" title="Burning Man">Burning
Man</a>. The concept developed as Pendell reflected on the challenges of
political action in the United States over the previous 30 years,
particularly its lack of joy and festive spirit. Drawing inspiration
from <a href="Barbara_Ehrenreich" class="wikilink"
title="Barbara Ehrenreich">Barbara Ehrenreich</a>'s work on
transcendence and festivals, Pendell noted how medieval European
festivals served as centers of political rebellion before being
suppressed by the rising power of the state, Protestantism, and
Enlightenment rationalism.

The philosophical foundation draws heavily from
<a href="Norman_O._Brown" class="wikilink"
title="Norman O. Brown">Norman O. Brown</a>, who in 1990 prophetically
wrote about the strengthening of Eros creating "new institutions of
individual generosity and public joy." Brown envisioned carnivalesque
extravaganzas where gift-giving could revel in its intrinsic,
self-sacrificial nature, uninhibited by resentment of the exploited and
excluded.

Pendell's concept was further influenced by
<a href="Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>'s
insight that cooperation and mutual aid were fundamental to human
evolution over 40,000 years of existence. Ancient Paleolithic burials
showing care for arthritic individuals who required years of assistance
demonstrated that humans evolved large brains specifically to care for
each other - "we're the people who take care of each other."

## Outline

Horizon Anarchism distinguishes itself from traditional anarchist
approaches through its long-term perspective and acceptance of reformist
measures as stepping stones toward the ultimate goal. Unlike some
anarchist movements that reject all governmental participation, Horizon
Anarchism embraces what Pendell calls a "thousand-year view" -
recognizing that dismantling state apparatus may take centuries but
viewing this as acceptable progress.

The framework identifies several key principles:

**Anti-Statism with Pragmatism**: While fundamentally opposed to the
state as "the greatest weapon of mass destruction," Horizon Anarchism
acknowledges the current necessity of using state mechanisms to
constrain corporate power, following
<a href="Noam_Chomsky" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a>'s analysis that the state currently serves as the only
bulwark against corporate domination.

**Cooperation Over Competition**: The philosophy emphasizes humanity's
evolved capacity for mutual aid and cooperation, viewing
competition-based systems as aberrations from our natural social
organization.

**Festival as Political Action**: Drawing from historical examples,
Horizon Anarchism sees gatherings like Burning Man as inherently
political acts that demonstrate alternative ways of organizing society
without corporate logos or hierarchical control.

**Embodied Practice**: Following the anarchist principle that "the ends
do not justify the means," Horizon Anarchism emphasizes that present
practice must embody the desired future society.

**Corporate Critique**: The philosophy identifies corporations as
"hungry ghosts" (Buddhist pretas) - entities of pure craving that can
never be satisfied, supported entirely by state power and public
subsidy.

## Tendencies

Horizon Anarchism manifests through several practical tendencies:

**Festive Resistance**: Participation in temporary autonomous zones and
festival cultures that demonstrate alternative social organization while
maintaining joy and celebration as central elements.

**Imagination Liberation**: Following
<a href="William_Blake" class="wikilink" title="William Blake">William
Blake</a>'s principle of "mental fight" as the alternative to "corporeal
war," the movement emphasizes breaking free from limiting conceptual
frameworks and experimenting with new forms of social organization.

**Gradual Dismantling**: Unlike revolutionary approaches, Horizon
Anarchism accepts the possibility of working through existing systems to
gradually reduce state power and military apparatus over generations.

**Mutual Aid Practice**: Emphasis on building cooperative networks and
support systems that demonstrate anarchist principles in daily life.

**Anti-Isolation**: Recognition that state power depends on individual
isolation, making collective gathering and community building inherently
subversive acts.

**Poetick Praxis**: A tendency to reverie, or to respond. That this is
not, not that, does not imply it is this or : (A')' =! A ; a risk, and a
gamble - to rely upon the awakening of Mind and realise the body-ness of
the body -- always here; always the link, the thread; do the cyber-real
and/or the stratosphere contain plants, trees? This, despite the
algorithmic fractals of spatial roses.

## Criticism

Critics of Horizon Anarchism may point to several potential weaknesses:

**Temporal Optimism**: The thousand-year timeline may be seen as
unrealistic given accelerating environmental and social crises that
require more immediate action.

**Reformist Compromise**: Traditional anarchists argue that working
within state systems ultimately reinforces state power rather than
dismantling it.

**Cultural Privilege**: The emphasis on festival culture and Burning Man
may reflect class and cultural privileges not available to all
populations.

**Libertarian Confusion**: The philosophy risks being conflated with
right-wing libertarianism, which seeks to dismantle social protections
while maintaining property rights and corporate power.
