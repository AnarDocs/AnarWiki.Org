# Anarchism AND Socialism: A Response to Stalin’s False Dichotomy

<span id="introduction-the-manufactured-opposition"></span>

## Introduction: The Manufactured Opposition

In 1906-07, Joseph Stalin penned ’Anarchism or Socialism?‘ - a work that
would become a template for authoritarian misrepresentation of anarchist
thought. Writing under the pressure of revolutionary upheaval, Stalin
sought to discredit anarchism not through honest engagement but through
constructing elaborate straw figures to demolish. His opening gambit
reveals the entire game:

> ’The cornerstone of anarchism is the individual, whose emancipation,
> according to its tenets, is the principal condition for the
> emancipation of the masses… The cornerstone of Marxism, however, is
> the masses, whose emancipation, according to its tenets, is the
> principal condition for the emancipation of the individual.‘

This manufactured opposition between individual and collective
liberation serves a specific purpose: positioning state socialism as the
only ’scientific‘ path whilst dismissing anarchism as petty-bourgeois
idealism. But this framing fundamentally misunderstands - or
deliberately misrepresents - anarchist philosophy.

## Part I: The Dialectical Muddle

<span id="the-false-dichotomy-of-individual-vs-collective"></span>

### The False Dichotomy of Individual vs Collective

Stalin claims that anarchists proclaim ’Everything for the individual‘
whilst Marxists champion ’Everything for the masses.‘ He insists:
’Clearly, we have here two principles, one negating the other, and not
merely disagreements on tactics.‘

This crude binary thinking reveals either profound ignorance or
calculated deception. We anarcho-communists don’t see individual and
collective liberation as opposing forces requiring one to be
subordinated to the other. Rather, we understand them as inseparable and
mutually reinforcing. The freedom of each person is not limited by, but
rather enhanced through, the freedom of all.

When Kropotkin wrote about mutual aid, he wasn’t advocating isolated
individualism but describing how cooperation and solidarity are
fundamental to both individual flourishing and collective wellbeing. We
reject both the capitalist myth of the isolated individual and the
authoritarian subjugation of persons to an abstract ’collective‘ managed
by party bureaucrats.

<span id="dialectics-without-dogma"></span>

### Dialectics Without Dogma

Stalin dedicates considerable space to defending dialectical
materialism, spending pages attacking anarchists for supposedly being
metaphysicians. He writes:

> ’Dialectics tells us that nothing in the world is eternal, everything
> in the world is transient and mutable… that is why dialectics regards
> everything critically; that is why it denies the existence of a
> once-and-for-all established truth.‘

The irony is breathtaking. His own party would establish its
interpretation of Marxism as precisely such an eternal truth, with
dissent punished as counter-revolutionary heresy. Stalin accuses
anarchists of metaphysics whilst his dialectical method somehow always
arrives at the necessity of state power, party dictatorship, and the
suppression of dissent.

Stalin claims Proudhon was a metaphysician because he believed in
’immutable justice.‘ But Proudhon’s critique of property - ’property is
theft‘ - was a material analysis of exploitation, not metaphysical
speculation. The anarchist tradition has continuously evolved through
practice and theory, from Proudhon through Bakunin, Kropotkin,
Malatesta, Goldman, and countless others who refined ideas in response
to changing conditions.

<span id="the-question-of-revolutionary-agency"></span>

### The Question of Revolutionary Agency

Stalin presents revolution as something that occurs when ’productive
forces have sufficiently matured,‘ quoting Marx: ’No social order ever
perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it
have developed.‘

This mechanical materialism treats revolution as an inevitable outcome
of economic development rather than the conscious action of people
seeking liberation. Stalin writes: ’Evolution prepares for revolution
and creates the ground for it; revolution consummates the process of
evolution and facilitates its further activity.‘

But the Paris Commune didn’t wait for productive forces to mature -
workers seized the opportunity when they had arms and organisation. The
Ukrainian Free Territory emerged not from economic inevitability but
from peasants deciding to take control of their lives. Revolutionary
Spain saw workers and peasants immediately reorganising society without
consulting historical schemas.

Stalin’s determinism serves a purpose: if revolution follows scientific
laws, then the party that understands these laws must guide the masses.
The vanguard becomes necessary not because workers choose it, but
because history demands it.

<span id="the-slander-of-scientific-method"></span>

### The Slander of Scientific Method

Throughout this section, Stalin repeatedly accuses anarchists of being
unscientific. He mocks our supposed inability to understand that ‘the
same democratic republic can be ’good’ and ‘bad’ at the same time.‘

We understand perfectly well that phenomena can have contradictory
aspects. What we reject is using this dialectical flexibility to justify
whatever the party decides. If the democratic republic is both good and
bad, then surely party dictatorship can be justified using the same
logic - it’s ’good‘ insofar as it suppresses the bourgeoisie, ’bad‘ only
in some abstract future sense that never arrives.

The anarchist approach to social transformation is deeply empirical. We
learn from actual experiments in non-hierarchical organisation, from
successes and failures in workers’ control, from practical experience.
We don’t need to genuflect before nineteenth-century texts as though
they contained eternal truths.

<span id="part-ii-the-materialist-mystification"></span>

## Part II: The Materialist Mystification

<span id="the-crude-reduction-of-anarchist-thought"></span>

### The Crude Reduction of Anarchist Thought

Stalin begins his discussion of materialism by attempting to paint
anarchists as confused idealists. He claims we don’t understand that
’social being determines consciousness.‘ He presents his famous
shoemaker parable:

> ’This proletarianised shoemaker goes on working, but finds that it is
> a very difficult matter to save money… Here our shoemaker realises
> that in order to improve his conditions he must fight the masters and
> not open a workshop of his own.‘

The story is revealing in what it omits: any mention of the worker’s own
agency, creativity, or capacity for self-organisation. The shoemaker is
portrayed as a passive vessel whose consciousness mechanically reflects
his economic position. But workers don’t simply absorb ideas based on
their conditions - they actively interpret experiences, discuss with
comrades, experiment with resistance, and develop understanding through
struggle.

Stalin writes: ’It is not the consciousness of men that determines their
being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their
consciousness.‘ We don’t dispute that material conditions shape
consciousness. What we reject is the mechanical determinism that
Marxist-Leninists use to justify their rule - the idea that workers need
an enlightened vanguard to interpret their conditions for them.

<span id="the-question-of-form-and-content"></span>

### The Question of Form and Content

Stalin argues: ‘content is impossible without form, but the point is
that since a given form lags behind its content, it never fully
corresponds to this content; and so the new content is ’obliged’ to
clothe itself for a time in the old form, and this causes a conflict
between them.‘

This abstract philosophising conceals a political agenda. Stalin uses
this form/content distinction to argue that economic development must
precede political transformation - conveniently justifying whatever
political form the party imposes as historically necessary. But the
Bolshevik state didn’t wither away as economic conditions developed; it
became more entrenched, creating a new ruling class of bureaucrats.

<span id="material-conditions-and-human-agency"></span>

### Material Conditions and Human Agency

The most pernicious aspect of Stalin’s materialism is how it erases
human agency. He states: ’we must seek the grounds for a given ideal not
in the minds of men, not in their imaginations, but in the development
of their economic conditions.‘

This isn’t materialism - it’s fatalism. Real materialism acknowledges
that whilst we don’t make history under conditions of our choosing, we
do make history. Ideas become material forces when they grip masses of
people. The belief in self-organisation can transform material reality,
as shown repeatedly in revolutionary moments.

Stalin accuses anarchists of saying ’man is what he eats‘ whilst
simultaneously claiming this is vulgar materialism. He writes: ’Don’t
you really know that physiological phenomena, such as eating, for
example, differ fundamentally from sociological phenomena?‘

But we never reduced consciousness to eating - that’s Stalin’s strawman.
What we argue is that authoritarian political forms can become obstacles
to economic liberation, that means shape ends, that you cannot build a
free society through dictatorship.

<span id="part-iii-the-dictatorship-deception"></span>

## Part III: The Dictatorship Deception

<span id="the-poisoned-well-of-scientific-socialism"></span>

### The Poisoned Well of ’Scientific‘ Socialism

Stalin’s third section reveals the authoritarian project most clearly.
He writes:

> ’The dialectical method affirms that only that class which is growing
> day by day, which always marches forward and fights unceasingly for a
> better future, can be progressive to the end.‘

This sounds revolutionary, but notice how it sets up the need for
interpreters of which class is ’growing‘ and what constitutes ’marching
forward.‘ The party positions itself as the scientific authority
determining history’s direction.

<span id="the-paris-commune-misreading-revolution"></span>

### The Paris Commune: Misreading Revolution

Stalin extensively quotes Engels: ’Do you want to know what this
dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat.‘

But Stalin fundamentally misunderstands what made the Commune
revolutionary. He focuses on it being the ’dictatorship of the
proletariat‘ whilst ignoring its anarchist features:

- Immediate recall of all delegates
- Workers’ wages for all officials
- Direct democracy replacing representative government
- Armed people replacing standing armies
- No separation between legislative and executive power

Stalin quotes Arthur Arnould describing the Commune: ’This dictatorship
lasted uninterruptedly for over two months… the people were the rulers,
the only rulers, they themselves set up their police and magistracy.‘

Yes! The people were the rulers - not a party claiming to represent
them. This is precisely what anarchists advocate, and precisely what
Stalin’s party would destroy at Kronstadt and elsewhere.

<span id="the-state-that-wont-wither"></span>

### The State That Won’t Wither

Stalin quotes Marx and Engels extensively about the state withering
away:

> ’The working class in the course of its development will substitute
> for the old bourgeois society an association which will exclude
> classes and their antagonism, and there will be no more political
> power properly so-called.‘

And Engels:

> ’The state, then, has not existed from all eternity… We are now
> rapidly approaching a stage in the development of production at which
> the existence of these classes… will become a positive hindrance to
> production. They will fall as inevitably as they arose… Along with
> them the state will inevitably fall.‘

Yet Stalin’s own practice would prove these predictions false. The
‘workers’ state‘ became a state over workers. The ’transitional period‘
became permanent. The dictatorship of the proletariat became
dictatorship of the party, then of the central committee, then of Stalin
himself.

<span id="manufacturing-anarchist-positions"></span>

### Manufacturing Anarchist Positions

Stalin repeatedly attributes positions to anarchists that we don’t hold.
He claims we believe in ’state capitalism‘ where ’each must work as much
as he likes, or as much as the state determines.‘ He says we want to
preserve ’representative government and wage-labour.‘

These accusations are particularly ironic. Stalin’s Soviet Union
established precisely what he accused us of wanting - state capitalism
with party bosses, wage labour under ’socialist‘ management, and
representative government becoming party dictatorship.

He writes that according to anarchists: ’What is the collectivism of the
Social-Democrats? Collectivism, or more correctly, state capitalism, is
based on the following principle: each must work as much as he likes, or
as much as the state determines.‘

But we anarchists advocate the abolition of wage labour entirely, not
its management by a ‘workers’ state.‘ We seek the free association of
producers, not state-directed production. Stalin attributes to us
precisely what his system would create.

<span id="the-violence-question"></span>

### The Violence Question

Stalin accuses anarchists of rejecting revolutionary violence, quoting
supposed anarchist texts claiming Marxists believe ’only by means of
ballot papers… can parties capture power.‘

This is absurd. Anarchists have consistently engaged in revolutionary
struggle. The Black Army in Ukraine fought both Whites and Reds. Spanish
anarchists fought fascism with arms. The propaganda of the deed,
whatever its strategic merits, was hardly pacifist.

What we reject isn’t revolutionary violence but the institutionalisation
of violence in the state. Stalin quotes Marx approvingly: ’The
proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all
capital from the bourgeoisie.‘

But ’political supremacy‘ exercised through state power creates new
forms of domination. The means determine the ends - authoritarian
methods create authoritarian outcomes.

<span id="beyond-the-state-socialist-betrayal"></span>

## Beyond the State Socialist Betrayal

<span id="every-workers-state-becomes-a-state-over-workers"></span>

### Every ’Worker’s State‘ Becomes a State Over Workers

Stalin proclaims: ’The dictatorship of the proletariat will be a
dictatorship of the entire proletariat as a class over the bourgeoisie
and not the domination of a few individuals over the proletariat.‘

History has thoroughly refuted this claim. Every ’dictatorship of the
proletariat‘ has become dictatorship over the proletariat:

- The Soviet Union crushed the Kronstadt sailors’ call for ’Soviets
  without Bolsheviks‘
- The Bolsheviks destroyed the factory committees that practiced
  workers’ control
- Independent unions were abolished in favour of party-controlled
  organisations
- Workers who struck were shot as counter-revolutionaries

Stalin himself would perfect this system, but its foundations were laid
by the very conception of revolutionary party dictatorship that he
advocates.

<span id="the-question-of-scale"></span>

### The Question of Scale

Stalin argues that socialism must be built on ’the broad basis of modern
large-scale industry‘ and mocks what he calls Kropotkin’s ’scattered‘
community socialism. He insists: ’we must welcome the expansion of
production and regard as the basis of future socialism not separate
towns and communities, but the entire and indivisible territory of the
whole state.‘

This conflates two separate issues: the scale of production and the
scale of political control. We don’t oppose large-scale industry - we
oppose hierarchical management of industry. Factories can be run by
workers’ councils. Railways can be coordinated through federal
agreements. The internet itself proves complex systems can function
through distributed networks rather than central control.

Stalin’s insistence on centralisation serves political purposes. By
declaring that socialism requires state-wide coordination, he justifies
party control over all aspects of life. But the Spanish collectives
showed that federal coordination could manage complex economies without
central states.

<span id="the-synthesis-anarchist-communism-as-true-socialism"></span>

## The Synthesis: Anarchist Communism as True Socialism

<span id="we-are-the-genuine-socialists"></span>

### We Are the Genuine Socialists

Stalin concludes his work claiming anarchists ’are not genuine
Socialists‘ and ’not genuine revolutionaries.‘ Let’s examine who truly
upholds socialist principles:

**Abolition of classes**: Stalin’s system created a new class division
between party bureaucrats and workers. We seek to abolish hierarchy
entirely.

**Workers’ control**: Stalin advocated party control over workers. We
demand direct workers’ control through their own organisations.

**Abolition of the state**: Stalin’s state never withered away. We work
to make it irrelevant through building alternative structures.

**From each according to ability, to each according to need**: Stalin
maintained wage labour and inequality. Spanish anarchist collectives
immediately implemented needs-based distribution.

<span id="the-living-revolutionary-tradition"></span>

### The Living Revolutionary Tradition

Wherever working people take direct control, they instinctively move
toward anarchist practices:

- The Paris Commune that Stalin himself invokes practiced direct
  democracy and recall of delegates
- Russian workers created factory committees practicing self-management
  before the Bolsheviks crushed them
- Spanish workers and peasants organised production without bosses or
  states
- Hungarian workers’ councils in 1956 rejected both capitalism and
  ’socialist‘ party rule
- The Zapatistas today practice autonomous self-governance without
  capturing state power

The revolutionary impulse is inherently anarchist - it’s only
’revolutionary‘ parties that impose hierarchy onto naturally horizontal
movements.

<span id="means-and-ends"></span>

### Means and Ends

Stalin writes: ’strikes, boycott, parliamentarism, meetings and
demonstrations are all good forms of struggle as means for preparing and
organising the proletariat. But not one of these means is capable of
abolishing existing inequality.‘

He’s right that these alone are insufficient. But his solution - party
dictatorship - doesn’t abolish inequality either. It creates new forms
of inequality between party and masses, between political directors and
directed workers.

We argue that means shape ends. Hierarchical revolutionary organisations
create hierarchical post-revolutionary societies. Authoritarian methods
of struggle produce authoritarian outcomes. You cannot create a free
society through dictatorship, just as you cannot create peace through
war or equality through hierarchy.

<span id="conclusion-anarchism-and-socialism"></span>

## Conclusion: Anarchism AND Socialism

’Anarchism or Socialism?‘ Stalin’s question assumes we must choose
between freedom and equality, between liberty and solidarity. But this
is the authoritarian mind at work, unable to imagine people organising
without masters.

We answer: **Both!**

Anarchism without socialism becomes individualist chaos or worse,
’anarcho‘-capitalism - a grotesque contradiction where private property
creates new hierarchies.

Socialism without anarchism becomes state capitalism - where party
bureaucrats become the new ruling class.

But anarchist socialism - communist anarchism - offers genuine
liberation: free individuals cooperating as equals, autonomy and
solidarity reinforcing each other, common affairs managed through
voluntary federal agreements rather than state commands.

Stalin wanted to force this false choice because his ‘socialism‘
required submission to party dictatorship. But we’ve seen where that
path leads. Every ‘workers’ state‘ has betrayed workers. Every
’transitional period‘ has become permanent. Every party claiming to
represent the proletariat has become a force above the proletariat.

The revolution isn’t a future event to be managed by revolutionary
specialists interpreting historical laws. It’s the ongoing process of
replacing domination with cooperation, hierarchy with equality,
exploitation with mutual aid. Every strike that bypasses union
bureaucrats, every factory occupied and run collectively, every
community organising mutual aid - these are moments where anarchist
socialism emerges naturally from below.

Stalin’s great fear, hidden beneath his mockery and misrepresentation,
was that workers might realise they don’t need shepherds. His entire
theoretical edifice - the dialectical materialism that always concludes
in party rule, the historical stages that always require vanguard
guidance, the dictatorship that never withers away - serves to convince
workers they need professional revolutionaries to lead them.

But we know better. The most profound revolutionary moments have always
been anarchist in practice, whatever their participants called
themselves. When workers take control, they don’t recreate the old
hierarchies with new personnel - they create new forms of organisation
based on equality and solidarity.

Both the hands of Anarchism and Socialism are needed to grasp and take
hold our freedom.

The choice isn’t between Stalin’s ’scientific socialism‘ and capitalism.
It’s between genuine liberation and new forms of domination wrapped in
revolutionary rhetoric. We choose liberation. We choose the unity of
anarchism and socialism that Stalin tried so desperately to tear apart.
