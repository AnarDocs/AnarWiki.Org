# Co-optation of Anarchist Terminology by Capitalists

## Overview

The co-optation of anarchist terminology by
<a href="Propertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-libertarian">right-libertarian</a> capitalists represents a
deliberate appropriation of anarchist language and symbolism by
proponents of free-market capitalism and private property. Beginning in
the mid-20th century, certain right-libertarian theorists began
describing their pro-capitalist philosophy as "anarchism" despite
advocating for economic systems fundamentally incompatible with
anarchist principles of opposing all forms of hierarchy and domination.

This phenomenon primarily centers on the self-described ideology of
"anarcho-capitalism," a term coined by Murray Rothbard in 1971. These
theorists claim anarchist identity while defending private property,
wage labor, landlordism, and other capitalist relations that anarchists
have consistently opposed since the emergence of anarchism as a distinct
political philosophy in the 19th century.[^1]

The appropriation extends beyond the term "anarchism" to include
"libertarian," a word coined by French anarchist Joseph Déjacque in 1857
to describe anti-authoritarian socialism, which American right-wing
proponents deliberately adopted in the 1950s as right-wing politics
became increasingly associated with authoritarianism.[^2]

## Historical Context

### Traditional Anarchist Opposition to Capitalism

Since its founding, anarchism has consistently defined itself in
opposition to both state authority and capitalist economic relations.
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, widely regarded as the first self-identified
anarchist, famously declared "property is theft" in 1840, specifically
targeting private ownership of productive resources.[^3] Mikhail Bakunin
emphasized that anarchism meant opposition to "economic privilege"
alongside political privilege.[^4] Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, and
subsequent anarchist theorists maintained this dual opposition to state
and capital as definitional to anarchism.

Anarchists argue that private property in land and productive resources
creates hierarchical relationships between property owners and workers,
between landlords and tenants, and between those with capital and those
without. These power relationships, anarchists contend, generate
domination and exploitation regardless of whether a state apparatus
enforces them.[^5]

### The American Right-Libertarian Tradition

The appropriation of anarchist terminology emerged from the American
right-libertarian movement of the mid-20th century, itself rooted in
classical liberal economic theory and opposition to New Deal social
programs. These theorists prioritized absolute property rights and free
markets while seeking to distinguish themselves from both conservative
and liberal political traditions.

Figures like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek influenced a
generation of American libertarians who increasingly questioned even
minimal state functions. This created intellectual space for theorists
to advocate complete abolition of the state while maintaining commitment
to capitalist property relations—a combination anarchists consider
contradictory.

## Notable Proponents

### Murray Rothbard

Murray Rothbard (1926-1995) stands as the central figure in the
appropriation of anarchist terminology. An economist in the Austrian
School tradition, Rothbard initially described himself as a "private
property anarchist" in 1954 before coining the term "anarcho-capitalism"
in 1971.[^6] His major work *For a New Liberty: The Libertarian
Manifesto* (1973) and *The Ethics of Liberty* (1982) systematically
argued for the elimination of the state while defending private
property, wage labor, and free-market capitalism.

Rothbard's philosophy rests on absolute property rights derived from
self-ownership and homesteading principles. He advocated for all public
services—including police, courts, and military defense—to be provided
by competing private firms in a market system. He explicitly rejected
traditional anarchist concern with economic hierarchy, arguing that
voluntary contracts between property owners and workers involve no
coercion regardless of vastly unequal bargaining positions.[^7]

Rothbard defended the right of property owners to establish any rules
within their property, including the right of parents to "sell" children
or the right of landowners to establish dictatorial authority over
anyone on their land. He dismissed worker ownership and collective
management as unnecessary restrictions on property rights. His economic
vision accepted and defended vast wealth inequality as the natural
result of market processes.[^8]

### David D. Friedman

David D. Friedman (1945-present), son of economist Milton Friedman,
developed a consequentialist defense of what he calls
"anarcho-capitalism" in his influential work *The Machinery of Freedom*
(1973). Unlike Rothbard's natural rights approach, Friedman argues for
stateless capitalism purely on efficiency grounds, claiming competitive
private defense agencies and legal systems would produce better outcomes
than government monopolies.

Friedman explicitly identifies as anarchist, stating in his book: "In
that sense I am an anarchist."[^9] However, his vision fully embraces
wage labor, landlordism, and capitalist firms operating for profit. He
envisions a society where individuals purchase protection from competing
defense companies and where all land and resources are privately owned.

His economic analysis treats labor as a commodity to be bought and sold
in markets, accepting employer-employee relationships as natural and
efficient. He shows no concern for the power dynamics between employers
and workers or between property owners and the propertyless, viewing
these relationships purely through the lens of voluntary exchange.

### Hans-Hermann Hoppe

Hans-Hermann Hoppe (1949-present), a German-born economist and
philosopher, represents a contemporary voice in right-libertarian
appropriation of anarchist language. A student of Rothbard, Hoppe
describes himself as an "anarcho-capitalist" while developing arguments
that blend Austrian economics with deeply conservative social views.

Hoppe's major work *Democracy: The God That Failed* (2001) argues that
private property-based monarchy would be superior to democracy, while
also claiming that complete elimination of the state in favor of
competing private defense agencies represents the ideal system.[^10] He
advocates for "covenant communities"—essentially private
neighborhoods—where property owners could establish and enforce any
social norms, explicitly including the exclusion or forcible removal of
people based on lifestyle choices, political views, or other
characteristics.

Hoppe's vision explicitly embraces economic hierarchy and elite rule by
property owners. He argues that those with wealth have superior time
preference and planning ability, justifying their dominance over the
propertyless. His anarchism consists solely of opposition to government
monopoly on force, while endorsing private monopolies on force within
property boundaries and accepting vast economic inequality as natural
and desirable.

## Why This Is Not Anarchism

### Anarchist Critique of "Anarcho-Capitalism"

Anarchists argue that the right-libertarian appropriation of anarchist
terminology represents a fundamental misunderstanding—or deliberate
misrepresentation—of anarchism's core principles. Anarchism has always
opposed all forms of hierarchy and domination, not merely state
authority. The economic relations defended by self-described
"anarcho-capitalists" create and maintain hierarchical power structures
incompatible with anarchist principles.

**Private Property as Hierarchy**: Anarchists distinguish between
personal possessions (items used by individuals) and private property
(ownership of productive resources, land, and housing used by others).
Private property in the latter sense creates hierarchical relationships
where property owners exercise authority over workers, tenants, and the
propertyless. A landlord-tenant relationship involves domination
regardless of whether a state enforces it—the landlord controls access
to a basic human need (shelter) and can impose conditions on tenants.
Similarly, an employer-employee relationship under capitalism involves
the employer exercising authority over workers' time, actions, and
labor.[^11]

**Wage Labor as Domination**: The wage labor system that
"anarcho-capitalists" defend requires workers to sell their labor to
property owners to survive. This creates a power imbalance where those
who own productive property exercise authority over those who must work
for wages. Anarchists have consistently identified this as a form of
domination, with Bakunin calling wage labor "wage slavery" and arguing
that genuine freedom requires workers to control their own productive
activity.[^12]

**Freedom Requires Material Equality**: Anarchists argue that formal
freedom—the absence of legal restrictions—means little without material
conditions that enable people to exercise meaningful choices. In a
system of vast economic inequality, the propertyless face coercive
pressure to accept unfavorable terms from property owners. A person who
must accept employment or starve does not enter "voluntary" contracts in
any meaningful sense. This critique appears throughout anarchist
literature from Proudhon through contemporary anarchist theorists.[^13]

**Historical Anarchist Consensus**: Every major anarchist
tendency—anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, collectivist anarchism,
and even individualist anarchism—has opposed capitalism and advocated
for worker control of production. Even individualist anarchists like
Benjamin Tucker, who supported markets and individual ownership,
explicitly opposed capitalist property rights in favor of
possession-based ownership and mutual banking systems that would
eliminate profit, rent, and interest.[^14] The anarchist tradition shows
consistent opposition to capitalism as a hierarchical system.

### Semantic Appropriation as Political Strategy

The adoption of anarchist terminology by right-libertarians served
strategic purposes in American politics. By the 1950s, American
conservatives had become associated with McCarthyism, militarism, and
social authoritarianism. Right-libertarians seeking to distinguish their
free-market advocacy from conservative authoritarianism began
appropriating left-wing terminology with anti-authoritarian
connotations.

The term "libertarian" in its original meaning referred to
anti-authoritarian socialists, coined by Joseph Déjacque in 1857 and
used throughout the 19th and 20th centuries to describe anarchists and
libertarian socialists. American right-libertarians deliberately adopted
this term in the 1950s-1960s, with some openly acknowledging they were
"stealing" it from the left.[^15]

Similarly, adopting "anarchism" allowed right-libertarians to claim a
radical anti-establishment position while defending an economic system
that anarchists view as fundamentally hierarchical. This appropriation
has created ongoing confusion, with casual observers sometimes mistaking
"anarcho-capitalism" for a legitimate anarchist tendency rather than
recognizing it as a rebranding of right-wing capitalism.

## Other Notable Proponents

Beyond the three primary figures, numerous other theorists and activists
have adopted anarchist language while defending capitalism:

- **Walter Block** - Economist who defends "voluntary slavery" contracts
  and argues for the legitimacy of any agreement between property owners
  and workers
- **Stephan Kinsella** - Intellectual property abolitionist who
  nevertheless defends all other forms of private property
- **Wendy McElroy** - Individualist who claims anarchist identity while
  defending free-market capitalism
- **Robert P. Murphy** - Economist who advocates for purely private law
  and defense agencies
- **Bryan Caplan** - Economist who combines anarchist
  self-identification with defense of unrestricted capitalism
- **Bruce Benson** - Legal theorist advocating market-based legal
  systems
- **Larken Rose** - Anti-tax activist and author who explicitly
  identifies as anarchist while defending private property and
  free-market capitalism
- **Samuel Edward Konkin III** - Founder of
  <a href="Agorism.md" class="wikilink" title="Agorism">Agorism</a>, a
  market-based theory emphasizing counter-economics and black markets as
  means to dissolve the state
- **Michael Malice** - Contemporary commentator and author who describes
  himself as anarchist while promoting individualist capitalism and
  appearing primarily in right-libertarian contexts

These figures vary in emphasis and specific positions but share the
common thread of claiming anarchist identity while defending capitalist
property relations and accepting or embracing economic hierarchy.
