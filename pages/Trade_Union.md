**Trade Unions** are organizations which (in theory) represent the
interests of
"<a   href="Working_Class.md" class="wikilink" title="workers">"workers</a> as
opposed to "<a   href="Boss.md" class="wikilink" title="bosses">"bosses</a>.

## History

Trade unions are seen by some as the successor to the
"<a   href="Guild.md" class="wikilink" title="guilds">"guilds</a> of medieval
Europe, although this is disputed. Trade unions first emerged in the
late 1700s in Northwest Europe (notably Britain) with the rise of the
industrial revolution and capitalism.

With the rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s and 1980s, many states began
to place strong legal restrictions on trade unions due them peaking at
their power, leading to several violent confrontations.

## Criticism

### Co-Opation

Many leftists have argued that trade unions, being entities clearly
visible to capitalists and the state, are vulnerable to

system and the entities that destroy radical movements.

### Workerism

Trade unions have been accused by some as
"<a   href="Workerism.md" class="wikilink" title="workerist">"workerist</a>,
being unable to account for people who do not work (ie the unemployed,
homemakers, children, teenagers, students, the elderly, the disabled and
prisoners, who make up around 40% of the population of most western
countries).
