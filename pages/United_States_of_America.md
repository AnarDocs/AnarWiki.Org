Empire</a>. Progressive forces for wealth and land reform were rapidly
put down, and neighbouring indigenous nations were conquered in a slow
process of manipulation, war and genocide until the entire continent was
conquered.

Black people and women remained in a condition of servitude whilst
limited democratic rights for white men were established by several
armed insurrections. The American Civil War abolished most of the feudal
and slaveowning elements of the economy (with some notable exceptions)
and the economy became increasingly dominated by capitalism and
corporations.
