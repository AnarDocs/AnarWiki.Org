# Libertarian Marxism

## Overview

**Libertarian Marxism** encompasses economic and political philosophies
that emphasize the anti-authoritarian and libertarian aspects of
<a href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Emerging
in opposition to <a href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a> and reformist
<a href="social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a>, libertarian Marxism draws
heavily from
<a href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and
<a href="Friedrich_Engels.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>' later works, particularly
the *Grundrisse* and *The Civil War in France*, which emphasize the
<a href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a>'s ability to forge its own destiny without a
<a href="vanguard_party.md" class="wikilink"
title="vanguard party">vanguard party</a>.[^1]

Along with
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>,
libertarian Marxism constitutes one of the main currents of
<a href="libertarian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarian socialism">libertarian socialism</a>. It includes
tendencies such as

<a href="workerism.md" class="wikilink" title="workerism">workerism</a>.
These movements have significantly influenced both post-left and social
anarchists.[^2]

## Origins

### Early Developments

Marxism began developing libertarian strands after specific historical
circumstances. One early expression appeared in
<a href="William_Morris.md" class="wikilink" title="William Morris">William
Morris</a> and the
<a href="Socialist_Party_of_Great_Britain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist Party of Great Britain">Socialist Party of Great
Britain</a> (SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with growing
concern at the bureaucratization and de-radicalization of international
socialism.[^3]

In December 1884, William Morris established the
<a href="Socialist_League.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist League">Socialist League</a>, encouraged by Friedrich
Engels and
<a href="Eleanor_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Eleanor Marx">Eleanor
Marx</a>. From 1887,
<a href="anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
began to outnumber Marxists in the organization. The 3rd Annual
Conference in London on 29 May 1887 marked a decisive shift, with
delegates voting for an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring
abstention from parliamentary action.[^4]

Morris ultimately sided with the anti-parliamentarians, causing the
Socialist League to lose Engels' support and prompting Eleanor Marx and
<a href="Edward_Aveling.md" class="wikilink" title="Edward Aveling">Edward
Aveling</a> to depart and form the Bloomsbury Socialist Society.[^5]

### The Paris Commune and Marx's Revision

<a href="Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Marx">Marx</a>'s address *The
Civil War in France* (1871), written for the
<a href="First_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a> two days after the
crushing of the
<a href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a>, represents a crucial libertarian text. Writing in an
International where
<a href="Bakunin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> held
extensive influence, Marx revised passages from the 1848
*<a href="Communist_Manifesto.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a>*.[^6]

The *Manifesto* had outlined a proletarian revolution by stages, with
the first stage being conquest of political power, through which
instruments of production would gradually be centralized in State hands.
Only after class antagonisms disappeared would production center in the
hands of "associated individuals" rather than the State.[^7]

<a href="Bakunin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a> had
criticized this two-stage approach since 1848, warning that once the
State installed itself as sole landowner, it would also become the only
capitalist, banker, and director of all national work. He predicted this
would create a powerful, highly centralized State with "hired engineers"
and "disciplined armies of rural workers."[^8]

In their 24 June 1872 preface to a new *Manifesto* edition, Marx and
Engels acknowledged that "in many respects" they would give "different
wording" to the 1848 text, citing "the practical experience gained first
in the February Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune."
They concluded that "the working class cannot simply lay hold of the
ready-made State machinery and wield it for its own purposes."[^9]

However, <a href="Bakunin.md" class="wikilink" title="Bakunin">Bakunin</a>
remained skeptical of this conversion, suggesting Marx had been forced
by circumstances to adopt positions he didn't truly hold. After Marx's
death, Engels largely reverted to the earlier statist positions of the
*Manifesto*.[^10]

## 20th Century Development

### Revolutionary Upheavals

The most significant ruptures occurred during and after
<a href="World_War_I.md" class="wikilink" title="World War I">World War
I</a>. Disillusioned with social democratic capitulation, excited by the
emergence of <a href="workers&#39;_councils.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a>, and increasingly
distanced from
<a href="Leninism.md" class="wikilink" title="Leninism">Leninism</a>, many
communists rejected socialist parties and placed faith in the masses
instead.
<a href="Rosa_Luxemburg.md" class="wikilink" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa
Luxemburg</a>'s workerism and spontaneism exemplified positions taken by
the
far-left—<a href="Anton_Pannekoek.md" class="wikilink" title="Anton Pannekoek">Anton
Pannekoek</a>,
<a href="Roland_Holst.md" class="wikilink" title="Roland Holst">Roland
Holst</a> and
<a href="Herman_Gorter.md" class="wikilink" title="Herman Gorter">Herman
Gorter</a> in the Netherlands,
<a href="Sylvia_Pankhurst.md" class="wikilink"
title="Sylvia Pankhurst">Sylvia Pankhurst</a> in Britain,
<a href="Gramsci.md" class="wikilink" title="Gramsci">Gramsci</a> in Italy,
and <a href="Lukács.md" class="wikilink" title="Lukács">Lukács</a> in
Hungary.[^11]

For these socialists, the
<a href="dictatorship_of_the_proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">dictatorship of the
proletariat</a> was to be the dictatorship of a class, "not of a party
or of a clique." However, tension between anti-vanguardism and
vanguardism frequently resolved in two opposed ways: drift toward the
party (exemplified by Gramsci and Lukács) or movement toward complete
proletarian spontaneity (the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined
toward complete eradication of the party form).[^12]

### Left Opposition to Bolshevism

In the emerging Soviet state, left-wing uprisings against the
<a href="Bolsheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>
included rebellions led by
<a href="Socialist_Revolutionaries.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist Revolutionaries">Socialist Revolutionaries</a>,
<a href="Left_Socialist_Revolutionaries.md" class="wikilink"
title="Left Socialist Revolutionaries">Left Socialist
Revolutionaries</a>,
<a href="Mensheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Mensheviks">Mensheviks</a>,
and
<a href="anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>.
These uprisings started in 1918 and continued through the
<a href="Russian_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> until 1922. The
Bolsheviks increasingly suppressed these groups with force.[^13]

The <a href="POUM.md" class="wikilink" title="POUM">POUM</a> is viewed as
libertarian Marxist due to its anti-Soviet stance during the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>.[^14]

### Theoretical Developments

For many libertarian socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist
orthodoxy necessitated a theoretical break. The
<a href="Bordigists.md" class="wikilink" title="Bordigists">Bordigists</a>
and SPGB championed super-Marxian theoretical intransigence. Others made
a return "behind Marx" to the anti-positivist program of German
idealism.[^15]

<a href="Karl_Korsch.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Korsch">Karl
Korsch</a> remained a libertarian socialist throughout much of his life
due to persistent theoretical openness. Korsch rejected the eternal and
static, obsessed with the essential role of practice in theory's truth.
For Korsch, no theory could escape history—not even Marxism. He credited
the stimulus for Marx's *Capital* to the movement of oppressed
classes.[^16]

In rejecting both
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and the State, libertarian socialists aligned with
<a href="anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>
in opposition to both capitalist
<a href="representative_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a> and
authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and Marxists share
an ultimate goal of a <a href="stateless_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="stateless society">stateless society</a>, anarchists criticize
most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase using the State.
Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as autonomism and
council communism have historically been intertwined with the anarchist
movement.[^17]

### Post-World War II

In the mid-20th century, some libertarian socialist groups emerged from
disagreements with
<a href="Trotskyism.md" class="wikilink" title="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a>.
The French group <a href="Socialisme_ou_Barbarie.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialisme ou Barbarie">Socialisme ou Barbarie</a> emerged from
the <a href="Fourth_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fourth International">Fourth International</a> in 1948, when
<a href="Cornelius_Castoriadis.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cornelius Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a> and
<a href="Claude_Lefort.md" class="wikilink" title="Claude Lefort">Claude
Lefort</a> experienced their "final disenchantment with Trotskyism." The
group's journal began appearing in March 1949. Castoriadis later stated
the main audience was "groups of the old, radical left:
<a href="Bordigists.md" class="wikilink" title="Bordigists">Bordigists</a>,
council communists, some anarchists and some offspring of the German
'left' of the 1920s."[^18]

In the United Kingdom, the group
<a href="Solidarity_(UK).md" class="wikilink"
title="Solidarity">Solidarity</a> was founded in 1960 by expelled
members of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. It was strongly
influenced by Socialisme ou Barbarie, particularly Castoriadis, whose
essays were among Solidarity's many pamphlets. The intellectual leader
was <a href="Chris_Pallis.md" class="wikilink" title="Chris Pallis">Chris
Pallis</a> (who wrote as <a href="Maurice_Brinton.md" class="wikilink"
title="Maurice Brinton">Maurice Brinton</a>).[^19]

The emergence of the
<a href="New_Left.md" class="wikilink" title="New Left">New Left</a> in the
1950s and 1960s led to revival of interest in libertarian socialism. The
New Left's critique of the Old Left's authoritarianism was associated
with strong interest in personal liberty and
<a href="autonomy.md" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>,
leading to rediscovery of older socialist traditions like
<a href="left_communism.md" class="wikilink" title="left communism">left
communism</a>, council communism, and the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a>. The New Left also led to anarchism's revival.[^20]

In 1969, French platformist anarcho-communist
<a href="Daniel_Guérin.md" class="wikilink" title="Daniel Guérin">Daniel
Guérin</a> published an essay "Libertarian Marxism?" dealing with the
Marx-Bakunin debate. He suggested that "libertarian marxism rejects
determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will,
intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the
masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings
of the 'elites'; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise,
provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a
heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards
itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown."[^21]

## Notable Tendencies

### Council Communism

<a href="Council_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Council communism">Council communism</a> originated in Germany
and the Netherlands in the 1920s, with the
<a href="Communist_Workers_Party_of_Germany.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Workers Party of Germany">Communist Workers Party of
Germany</a> (KAPD) as its primary organization. The central argument,
contrasting with <a href="social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a> and Leninist communism, is
that <a href="workers&#39;_councils.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a> arising in factories
and municipalities are the natural and legitimate form of working class
organization and governmental power—opposed to reformist and Bolshevik
stress on vanguard parties, parliaments, or the State.[^22]

The core principle holds that the State and economy should be managed by
workers' councils composed of delegates elected at workplaces and
recallable at any moment. Council communists oppose state-run
"bureaucratic socialism" and the idea of a "revolutionary party,"
believing party-led revolution necessarily produces party dictatorship.
They support <a href="workers&#39;_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; democracy">workers' democracy</a> through federation
of workers' councils.[^23]

Council communists held a critique of the
<a href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">Soviet
Union</a> as a capitalist state, believing the Bolshevik revolution
became bourgeois when party bureaucracy replaced feudal aristocracy.
They argued that because capitalist relations still existed—workers had
no say in running the economy—the Soviet Union ended as a
<a href="state_capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalist">state capitalist</a> country, with the State
replacing individual capitalists.[^24]

Key theorists included
<a href="Anton_Pannekoek.md" class="wikilink" title="Anton Pannekoek">Anton
Pannekoek</a>,
<a href="Otto_Rühle.md" class="wikilink" title="Otto Rühle">Otto Rühle</a>,
and
<a href="Herman_Gorter.md" class="wikilink" title="Herman Gorter">Herman
Gorter</a>.[^25]

### De Leonism

<a href="De_Leonism.md" class="wikilink" title="De Leonism">De Leonism</a>,
occasionally called Marxism–De Leonism, is a form of syndicalist Marxism
developed by
<a href="Daniel_De_Leon.md" class="wikilink" title="Daniel De Leon">Daniel
De Leon</a>, an early leader of the
<a href="Socialist_Labor_Party_of_America.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialist Labor Party of America">Socialist Labor Party of
America</a>. According to De Leonist theory, militant
<a href="industrial_unions.md" class="wikilink"
title="industrial unions">industrial unions</a> are the vehicle of
<a href="class_struggle.md" class="wikilink" title="class struggle">class
struggle</a>. Industrial unions serving proletarian interests will bring
about change needed to establish a socialist system. This differs from
some <a href="anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> currents in that De
Leonist thinking maintains a revolutionary political party is also
necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political field.[^26]

De Leonism predates Leninism—its principles developed in the early
1890s, before Lenin's 1902 *What Is To Be Done?*. The highly
decentralized and democratic nature of proposed De Leonist government
contrasts with <a href="democratic_centralism.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic centralism">democratic centralism</a> of
Marxism–Leninism. De Leonist success depends on achieving majority
support among people both in workplaces and at polls, contrasting with
Leninist notions of a small vanguard party leading the working
class.[^27]

### Left Communism

<a href="Left_communism.md" class="wikilink" title="Left communism">Left
communism</a> describes the range of communist viewpoints held by the
communist left, which criticizes Bolshevik political ideas from a
position asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than
Leninism held by the Communist International after its first
congress.[^28]

Although
<a href="Rosa_Luxemburg.md" class="wikilink" title="Rosa Luxemburg">Rosa
Luxemburg</a> lived before left communism became a distinct tendency,
she heavily influenced most left communists politically and
theoretically. Proponents have included
<a href="Amadeo_Bordiga.md" class="wikilink" title="Amadeo Bordiga">Amadeo
Bordiga</a>, Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek, Otto Rühle,
<a href="Karl_Korsch.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Korsch">Karl
Korsch</a>, Sylvia Pankhurst, and
<a href="Paul_Mattick.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Mattick">Paul
Mattick</a>.[^29]

Prominent left communist groups today include the
<a href="International_Communist_Current.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Communist Current">International Communist
Current</a> and the
<a href="International_Bureau_for_the_Revolutionary_Party.md"
class="wikilink"
title="International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party">International
Bureau for the Revolutionary Party</a>. Different factions from the old
Bordigist <a href="International_Communist_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Communist Party">International Communist Party</a>
are also considered left communist organizations.[^30]

### Socialisme ou Barbarie

<a href="Socialisme_ou_Barbarie.md" class="wikilink"
title="Socialisme ou Barbarie">Socialisme ou Barbarie</a> ("Socialism or
Barbarism") was a French radical libertarian socialist group of the
post-World War II period, named after a phrase Rosa Luxemburg used in
her 1916 essay *The Junius Pamphlet*. It existed from 1948 until 1965,
with <a href="Cornelius_Castoriadis.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cornelius Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a> as the animating
personality.[^31]

The group was composed of both intellectuals and workers and agreed that
main enemies of society were bureaucracies governing modern capitalism.
They documented and analyzed struggle against that bureaucracy in their
journal. The thirteenth issue (January–March 1954) was devoted to the
East German revolt of June 1953 and strikes among French workers that
summer. Following the belief that working class daily struggles
represented socialism's real content, intellectuals encouraged workers
to report on every aspect of working lives.[^32]

### Situationist International

The <a href="Situationist_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationist International">Situationist International</a> (SI)
was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957,
reaching peak influence during the unprecedented general wildcat strikes
of <a href="May_1968.md" class="wikilink" title="May 1968">May 1968</a> in
France.[^33]

With ideas rooted in Marxism and 20th century European artistic
<a href="avant-garde.md" class="wikilink"
title="avant-garde">avant-gardes</a>, they advocated experiences of life
alternative to those admitted by capitalist order, for fulfillment of
human primitive desires and pursuing superior passional quality. They
suggested and experimented with construction of situations—setting up
environments favorable for fulfilling such desires. They developed
experimental fields like <a href="unitary_urbanism.md" class="wikilink"
title="unitary urbanism">unitary urbanism</a> and
<a href="psychogeography.md" class="wikilink"
title="psychogeography">psychogeography</a>.[^34]

Their theoretical work peaked with
<a href="Guy_Debord.md" class="wikilink" title="Guy Debord">Guy Debord</a>'s
highly influential book
*<a href="The_Society_of_the_Spectacle.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Society of the Spectacle">The Society of the Spectacle</a>*.
Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like mass media and
advertising play a central role in advanced capitalist society, showing
fake reality to mask real capitalist degradation of human life. The SI
supported the May 1968 revolts, asking workers to occupy factories and
run them with <a href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> through workers' councils
composed of instantly revocable delegates.[^35]

After publishing analysis of May 1968 revolts in the magazine's last
issue, the SI dissolved in 1972.[^36]

### Autonomism

<a href="Autonomism.md" class="wikilink" title="Autonomism">Autonomism</a>
refers to left-wing political and social movements and theories close to
the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system, it first
emerged in Italy in the 1960s from workerist (*operaismo*) communism.
Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after
influence from the Situationists, failure of Italian far-left movements
in the 1970s, and emergence of important theorists including
<a href="Antonio_Negri.md" class="wikilink" title="Antonio Negri">Antonio
Negri</a>,
<a href="Mario_Tronti.md" class="wikilink" title="Mario Tronti">Mario
Tronti</a>, and
<a href="Paolo_Virno.md" class="wikilink" title="Paolo Virno">Paolo
Virno</a>.[^37]

Through translations by Danilo Montaldi and others, Italian autonomists
drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the
Johnson–Forest Tendency and in France by Socialisme ou Barbarie.[^38]

Autonomism influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide
<a href="social_centre.md" class="wikilink" title="social centre">social
centre</a> movement, and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a
lesser extent English-speaking countries. Those describing themselves as
autonomists now vary from Marxists to post-structuralists and
anarchists. The autonomist Marxist and autonomen movements provided
inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English-speaking
countries, particularly among anarchists.[^39]

### Communization

<a href="Communization.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communization">Communization</a> mainly refers to contemporary
communist theory mixing insurrectionist anarchism, communist ultra-left,
post-autonomists, anti-political currents, groups like the
<a href="Invisible_Committee.md" class="wikilink"
title="Invisible Committee">Invisible Committee</a>, and more explicitly
"communizing" currents such as
<a href="Théorie_Communiste.md" class="wikilink"
title="Théorie Communiste">Théorie Communiste</a> and
<a href="Endnotes.md" class="wikilink" title="Endnotes">Endnotes</a>.[^40]

The term's association with a self-identified "ultra-left" was cemented
in France in the 1970s, describing not a transition to higher communism
phase, but a vision of communist revolution itself. The 1975 pamphlet *A
World Without Money* states that "insurrection and communisation are
intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and
then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social
reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation
itself."[^41]

In the late 1990s, the French post-situationist group
<a href="Tiqqun.md" class="wikilink" title="Tiqqun">Tiqqun</a> developed a
close but not identical sense of "communization," emphasizing communism
as an immediate process rather than far-off goal, identifiable with
activities from squatting and setting up communes to simply
"sharing"—typically understood as "pre-revolutionary."[^42]

## Relationship to Anarchism

Libertarian Marxism has maintained a complex relationship with
anarchism. As anarchist
<a href="Wayne_Price.md" class="wikilink" title="Wayne Price">Wayne
Price</a> argues, while libertarian Marxism shares anarchism's
anti-authoritarian orientation and emphasis on working class
self-activity, it retains fundamental weaknesses of Marxism,
particularly a mechanistic view of historical development that assumes
the working class will ultimately "do things right" without need for
strategic organization.[^43]

Many anarchists look favorably on libertarian Marxism varieties.
<a href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> quotes council communist Anton Pannekoek and concludes, "In
fact, radical Marxism merges with anarchist currents." However, some
Marxists reject the connection—Antonio Negri declares in *Empire*, "We
are not anarchists but communists."[^44]

What anarchists find most positive about libertarian Marxism is belief
in working class self-activity, rejection of elite party rule, and focus
on workers' and popular councils formed in revolutionary upheavals.
These should unite as new power, replacing old state forms. Rather than
focusing on politics at tops of big bureaucratic unions, libertarian
Marxists look at shop floor struggles, showing how workers' initiative
affects production day to day.[^45]

However, libertarian Marxism shares weaknesses with much anarchism:
insufficient emphasis on revolutionary organization, strategic
inflexibility (particularly regarding working inside unions), and
inability to fully transcend Marxism's automatic view of history. The
council communists' rejection of party organization and automatic
assumption that workers would triumph led to passive attitudes toward
strategy and organization.[^46]

Despite these criticisms, Price acknowledges much in Marxism can be
mined by anarchists, particularly showing connection between
capitalism's functioning and development of a working class capable of
self-activity, moving toward creating revolutionary socialist society.
However, he concludes that socialists believing in liberation are better
off being anarchists.[^47]

## Criticism

### From Anarchists

Anarchist critics note that libertarian Marxism, while rejecting party
dictatorship, often retains problematic assumptions from orthodox
Marxism. <a href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> criticized
<a href="Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>'s
similar tendencies toward "mechanistic fatalism" and "excessive
optimism" about historical development—the same weaknesses present in
libertarian Marxism.[^49]

Wayne Price argues that libertarian Marxists are "traumatized by
Leninism" to the point of rejecting almost all revolutionary
organization, making it nearly impossible to understand why they
organize at all. Their belief that workers will ultimately succeed leads
to passivity regarding strategy and organization.[^50]

The libertarian Marxist attempt to escape Marxist "automaticity"—the
view that history inevitably progresses toward socialism—has not been
fully successful because this is not a misinterpretation but a central
part of Marx's Marxism. While there are real tendencies in capitalism
pushing toward socialist freedom (especially working class struggle),
there are counter-tendencies, and there is no automaticity or
inevitability about socialist revolution.[^51]

### From Orthodox Marxists

Orthodox Marxists, particularly Leninists, have consistently attacked
libertarian Marxism.
<a href="Lenin.md" class="wikilink" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>'s
*<a href="Left-Wing_Communism:_An_Infantile_Disorder.md" class="wikilink"
title="Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder">Left-Wing Communism:
An Infantile Disorder</a>* (1920) directly attacked left communists and
council communists, dismissing their positions as immature and harmful
to the revolutionary movement.[^52]

Leninist critics argue that rejection of the vanguard party leaves the
working class vulnerable to bourgeois ideology and unable to effectively
seize state power. They view libertarian Marxist emphasis on spontaneity
and workers' councils as utopian, arguing that without centralized party
leadership, revolutionary movements will inevitably fail.[^53]

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

The current worldwide revival of anarchism is premised partly on
Marxism's decline. Yet libertarian Marxism remains a strand to which
anarchists often feel close. Its libertarian-democratic, humanist, and
anti-statist qualities permit anarchists to use valuable aspects of
Marxism, such as economic analysis or theory of class struggle.[^54]

During the Great Depression and Cold War, when anarchists were few,
autonomous Marxists kept alive ideas of worker self-activity. They
maintained revolutionary opposition to
<a href="Stalinism.md" class="wikilink" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and
Western capitalism. They correctly analyzed Stalinism as
<a href="state_capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a> rather than some society
moving toward socialism. They predicted the post-World War II capitalist
boom would eventually end—as it did in the 1960s.[^55]

Contemporary movements influenced by libertarian Marxism include the
<a href="alter-globalization_movement.md" class="wikilink"

<a href="occupy_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="occupy movement">occupy movement</a>, and various
<a href="autonomous_social_centers.md" class="wikilink"
title="autonomous social centers">autonomous social centers</a>. The
revival of interest in workers' councils,
<a href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>,
and <a href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">prefigurative politics</a> owes much to
libertarian Marxist traditions.[^56]

However, as the memory of state-capitalist Communism fades, Marxism
continues attracting the left due to its extensive body of theory and
history in great revolutions from 1848 onward. Many anarchists seeking
theoretical depth look to libertarian Marxism as potentially consistent
with valuable anarchist principles—though fundamental tensions
remain.[^57]
