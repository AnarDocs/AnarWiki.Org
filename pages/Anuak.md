> If the Tiv and Lugbara award certain powers to a man without making
> him a king, the Anuak of the southern Sudan perhaps institute the
> status of king with its symbolic trappings but stripped of its powers.
> These horticultural people live in villages each of which has a
> headman who holds a 'court' and keeps sacred emblems of the village
> such as drums and beads. He is approached by others with signs of
> respect such as obeisance and the use of a special vocabulary.
> Although his house is no better than anyone else's, the fence posts
> are decorated with the skulls of animals killed to provide for the
> feasts he offers his people. While he has the trappings of kingship,
> the headman has in fact little power and is largely at the mercy of
> fellow villagers. As long as he can provide feasts he has good
> standing and his villagers will see to it that everyone shows the
> proper respect to the headman in his 'court'. He is, with the help of
> other third parties, able to persuade both the killer of a fellow
> villager to make compensation and the victim's kin to accept it.

> Anuak, however, do not believe a man should hold the headship for very
> long and, definitely, one who can no longer properly feast his
> followers deserves no support. He will then find his followers
> deserting him. A major faction opposing the headman and no longer
> respecting him will arise and install a rival who must be the son of
> some previous headman. Such an event leads to fighting in which the
> old headman may be deposed. Despite the quarrelling and intrigue which
> surrounds the headman office, it does operate as a unifying force in
> village affairs, which are otherwise defined by a segmentary lineage
> form of organisation similar to that already discussed. Although
> different factions may appear in a village, they are not revolutionary
> ones: no one seeks to abolish the position of headman.
>
> In south-eastern Anuak headmen are drawn only from a 'noble' clan,
> which apparently comes from outside the Anuak country. Necklaces,
> spears, stools and drums are emblems of the office and there is much
> struggle, intrigue and fighting to obtain possession of them. The
> holder has, as elsewhere in Anuakland, little authority in his own
> village, but if he can mobilise an armed force he could sometimes
> extend his influence and even gain a usually tenuous control over
> neighbouring villages.
>
> Thus, among the Anuak, we see the beginnings of a centralisation of
> authority, based initially upon a ceremonial and symbolic role and
> expanding in the south-east into a recognisable predatory form of
> organisation.
