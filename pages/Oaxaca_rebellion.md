> The rebellion in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca offer another
> example of popular decision-making. In 2006, people took over Oaxaca
> City and much of the state. The population of Oaxaca is over half
> indigenous, and the struggles there against colonialism and capitalism
> go back five hundred years. In June 2006, 70,000 striking teachers
> gathered in Oaxaca de Juarez, the capital, to press their demands for
> a living wage and better facilities for the students. On June 14, the
> police attacked the teacher’s encampment, but the teachers fought
> back, forcing the police out of the center of the city, taking over
> government buildings and evicting politicians, and setting up
> barricades to keep them out. Oaxaca City was self-organized and
> autonomous for five months, until federal troops were sent in.
>
> After they forced the police out of the capital city, the striking
> teachers were joined by students and other workers, and together they
> formed the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca (Popular Assembly
> of the Peoples of Oaxaca). The APPO became a coordinating body for the
> social movements of Oaxaca, effectively organizing social life and
> popular resistance for several months in the vacuum created by the
> collapse of state control. It brought together delegates from unions,
> non-governmental organizations, social organizations, and cooperatives
> across the state, seeking to make decisions in the spirit of
> indigenous practices of consensus — although most assemblies made
> decisions with a majority vote. APPO founders rejected electoral
> politics and called for people throughout the state to organize their
> own assemblies at every level.[^1] Recognizing the role of political
> parties in co-opting popular movements, the APPO banned them from
> participating.
>
> According to one activist who helped to found the APPO:
>
> > So the APPO was formed to address the abuses and create an
> > alternative. It was to be a space for discussion, reflection,
> > analysis, and action. We recognized that it shouldn’t be just one
> > organization, but rather a blanket coordinating body for many
> > different groups. That is, not one ideology would prevail; we would
> > focus on finding the common ground among diverse social actors.
> > Students, teachers, anarchists, Marxists, churchgoers — everyone was
> > invited.
> >
> > The APPO was born without a formal structure, but soon developed
> > impressive organizational capacity. Decisions in the APPO are made
> > by consensus within the general assembly, which was privileged as a
> > decision-making body. In the first few weeks of our existence we
> > created the APPO State Council. The council was originally composed
> > of 260 people — approximately ten representatives from each of
> > Oaxaca’s seven regions and representatives from Oaxaca’s urban
> > neighborhoods and municipalities.
> >
> > The Provisional Coordination was created to facilitate the operation
> > of the APPO through different commissions. A variety of commissions
> > were established: judicial, finance, communications, human rights,
> > gender equity, defense of natural resources, and many more.
> > Proposals are generated in smaller assemblies of each sector of the
> > APPO and then brought to the general assembly where they are debated
> > further or ratified.[^2]

> Time and again, spontaneous popular assemblies such as the one created
> in Oaxaca have proved capable of making sound decisions and
> coordinating the activities of an entire population. Naturally, they
> also attract people who want to take over social movements and people
> who consider themselves natural leaders. In many revolutions, what
> begins as a horizontal, libertarian rebellion becomes authoritarian as
> political parties or self-appointed leaders co-opt and shut down
> popular decision-making structures. Highly visible participants in
> popular assemblies can also be pushed towards conservatism by
> government repression, since they are the most visible targets.

> This is one way to interpret dynamics that developed in the APPO after
> the federal invasion of Oaxaca in late October, 2006. As the
> repression intensified, some of the more vocal participants in the
> assembly began calling for moderation, to the dismay of the segments
> of the movement that were still in the streets. Many APPO members and
> movement participants complain that the group was taken over by
> Stalinists and other parasites who use popular movements as tools for
> their political ambitions. And though the APPO had always taken a
> stand against political parties, the self-appointed leadership took
> advantage of the difficult situation to call for participation in the
> upcoming elections as the only pragmatic course of action.
>
> Many people felt betrayed. Support for collaboration was far from
> universal within APPO; it was controversial even within the APPO
> Council, the provisional decision-making group that was emerging as a
> leadership body. Some people within the APPO created other formations
> to disseminate anarchist, indigenist, or other anti-authoritarian
> perspectives, and many just went on with their work and ignored the
> calls to flock to the voting booths. In the end, the
> anti-authoritarian ethic that constituted the backbone of the movement
> and the basis of its formal structures proved stronger. The vast
> majority of Oaxacans boycotted the elections, and the PRI, the
> conservative party that already held power, dominated among the few
> people who came out to cast ballots. The attempt to transform the
> powerful, liberatory social movements of Oaxaca into a bid for
> political power was an absolute failure.
>
> A smaller Oaxacan city, Zaachila (pop. 25,000), can provide a closer
> look at horizontal decision-making. For years, groups had been working
> together against local forms of exploitation; among other efforts,
> they had managed to defeat the plan to construct a Coca Cola plant
> which would have consumed much of the available drinking water. When
> the rebellion erupted in Oaxaca City, a majority of the residents
> decided to take action. They convoked Zaachila’s first popular
> assembly with the ringing of the bells, calling everyone together, to
> share the news of the police attack in Oaxaca City and to decide what
> to do in their own town. More meetings and actions followed:
>
> > Men, women, children, and city council members joined together to
> > take over the municipal building. A lot of the building was locked
> > and we only used the hallways and the offices that were open. We
> > stayed in the municipal building night and day, taking care of
> > everything. And that’s how the neighborhood assemblies were born.
> > We’d say, “It’s the neighborhood of La Soledad’s turn and tomorrow
> > it’s up to San Jacinto.” That’s how the neighborhood assemblies were
> > first used, and then later they turned into decision-making bodies,
> > which is where we are now.
> >
> > The seizing of the municipal building was totally spontaneous. The
> > activists from before played a role and initially directed things,
> > but the popular assembly structure was developed little by little...
> >
> > Neighborhood assemblies, comprised of a rotating body of five
> > people, were also formed in each section of town and together they
> > would form the permanent popular assembly, the People’s Council of
> > Zaachila. The people from neighborhood assemblies may not be
> > activists at all, but little by little, as they follow their
> > obligation to bring information back and forth from the Council,
> > they develop their capacity for leadership. All the agreements made
> > in the Council are studied by these five people and then brought
> > back to the neighborhoods for review. These assemblies are
> > completely open; anyone can attend and have their voice heard.
> > Decisions always go to a general vote, and all the adults present
> > can vote. For example, if some people think a bridge needs to be
> > built, and others think we need to focus on improving electricity,
> > we vote on what the priority should be. The simple majority wins,
> > fifty-percent plus one.[^3]
>
> The townsfolk kicked out the mayor while maintaining public services,
> and also established a community radio station. The city served as a
> model for dozens of other municipalities throughout the state that
> soon proclaimed their autonomy.
>
> Years before these events in Zaachila, another group was organizing
> autonomous villages in the state of Oaxaca. As many as twenty-six
> rural communities affiliated with the CIPO-RFM (Council of Indigenous
> Peoples of Oaxaca — Ricardo Flores Magon), an organization that
> identifies with southern Mexico’s tradition of indigenous and
> anarchist resistance; the name references an indigenous anarchist
> influential in the Mexican Revolution. Insofar as they can, living
> under an oppressive regime, the CIPO communities assert their autonomy
> and help one another to meet their needs, ending private property and
> working the land communally. Typically, when a village expressed
> interest in joining the group, someone from the CIPO would come and
> explain how they worked, and let the villagers decide whether or not
> they wanted to join. The government frequently denied resources to
> CIPO villages, hoping to starve them out, but it is no surprise that
> many people thought they could live more richly as masters of their
> own lives, even if it meant greater material poverty.
