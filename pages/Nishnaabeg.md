The Nishnaabeg (or Anishaabeg), meaning "the people," refers to an
indigenous nation encompassing the Ojibwe, Odawa, Potawatomi,
Mississauga, Saulteaux, and Omàmìwinini. At different points in history,
the peoples of this nation have formed confederacies.[^1] They reside in
the lands today colonized by the "United States" and "Canada."

# Culture

Nishnaabeg tradition centers around a set of ethics, values and
practices called Bimaadiziwin, "living the good life." The culture
balances "strong individual autonomy and freedom" with the "needs of the
collective" and with "the natural world."[^2]

In Nishnaabeg tradition, children's education is self-directed, and
children are encouraged to learn what the land and animals teach them.
For example, a legend tells of a girl named Kwezen who watched a red
squirrel nibbling on a tree. Kwezens decided to drill a hole and drink
the sap herself. She showed the sap to her mother, who showed it to the
broader community. Ever since, the community has collected sap.
According to Leanne Simpson, Kwezens "already understands the importance
of observation and learning from our animal teachers."[^3] In this
culture, individuals "carry the responsibility for generating meaning
within their own lives."[^4]

Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg culture considers children to be "full citizens
with the same rights and responsibilities as adults," according to
Leanne Betasamosake Simpson.[^5]

Nishnaabeg traditions did not have a strict gender binary.[^6] The
Ojibwe had words for people who were assigned one gender at birth but
adopted the traits of the other gender. Someone who was assigned
maleness but chose to be a woman was called *ikwekaazo* (one who
endeavors to be like a woman), and someone who was assigned femaleness
but cohse to be a man was called *ininiikaazo* (one who endeavors to be
like a man). According to Nishnaabeg historian Anton Treuer, "Both were
considered to be strong spiritually, and they were always honored,
especially during ceremonies."[^7]

Potawatomi culture encourages sharing and portrays a monster named
Windigo who "suffers from the illness of taking too much and sharing too
little."[^8]

70% of the Potawatomi language consists of verbs, comprising what Robin
Wall Kimmerer calls a "grammar of animacy." Rather than speaking of
other beings or features as an "it," one typically speaks in terms of
processes. For example, a bay is expressed with a verb meaning "to be a
bay" (*wiikwegamaa*).[^9]

# Decisions

From the village to tribal levels, the Potawatomi historically made
decisions by consensus at public assemblies.

Leanne Betasamoksake Simpson writes, "Authoritarian power—aggressive
power that comes from coercion and hierarchy—wasn’t a part of the fabric
of Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg philosophy or governance, and so it wasn't a
part of our families."[^10] Simspon elaborates, "Stable governing
structures emerged when necessary and dissolved when no longer needed.
Leaders were also recognized (not self-appointed) and then disengaged
when no longer needed."[^11]

Further analysis is given by *Sprout Distro*:

# Economy

Custom said that individuals "could only take as much as they needed,
that they must share everything, following Nishnaabeg redistribution of
wealth customs, and no part of the animal could be wasted."[^13]

# Environment

Nishnaabeg custom says that when making a decision, a community must
consider its impact on plants and animals and on the next seven
generations of humans.[^14]

The precolonial Nishnaabeg made treaties with surrounding animal
nations. For example, they agreed with the fish nations that humans
would only fish at certain times of the year and at certain places. They
would only catch as much as they needed to eat. Treaties with other
animal nations said that humans would preserve forests and that human
hunters will not let meat go to waste. A general agreement with the
animal nations formed, according to tradition, a time long ago after
animals left the territory in protest of humans wasting meat and
disrespecting animals. The animal nations formed a council and the chief
deer put forth a request to the Nishaabeg, "Honour and respect our lives
and our beings, in life and in death. Cease doing what offends our
spirits. Do not waste our flesh. Preserve fields and forests for our
homes." The Nishnabeeg agreed, and the animals returned to the
land.[^15]

# Neighboring Societies

In precolonial times, the Nishnabeeg signed a treaty with the
"<a   href="Haudenosaunee.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haudenosaunee">"Haudenosaunee</a> called Gdoo-naaganinaa, meaning
"Our dish." The treaty recognized the fact that the two parties ate from
a shared "dish" since they shared hunting areas and overlapping plant
and animal species depended on the health of both parties' lands. The
treaty said that neither party could abuse the landbase, and Nishnabeeg
and Haudennosaunne delegates were required to regularly gather for
meetings and rituals.[^16]
