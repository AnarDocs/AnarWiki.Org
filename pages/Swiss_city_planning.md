> Ioan Bowen Rees, in the course of his valuable book *Government by
> Community*, compares the timid recommendations of the Skeffington
> Report on public participation in planning with current practice in
> Switzerland: 'It was with the public that the Swiss began, with the
> Parish Meeting, as it were, passing its own planning statute and
> approving its own development plan.' The person who is intoxicated by
> large-scale thinking asks how planning could operate under these
> conditions. Well, Mr Bowen Rees emphasises, 'No community in
> Switzerland is insignifi­cant. This means that a small commune can -
> and sometimes does hold up a motorway. And also that a small commune
> can - and some­ times does - save itself from economic stagnation by
> its own efforts. And why not? The result is neither poverty nor chaos.
