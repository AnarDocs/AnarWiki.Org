# Joseph Stalin

**Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin**, born **Ioseb Besarionis dze
Jughashvili**, was a Georgian revolutionary who rose to absolute power
in the Soviet Union through political manoeuvring and mass violence.
From the anarchist perspective, Stalin represents the ultimate
validation of <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>'s warnings about
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and state
socialism: that the pursuit of state power inevitably leads to a new
form of class domination, where a bureaucratic ruling class replaces the
old capitalist class while workers remain exploited.

Stalin's regime transformed the Soviet Union into what many anarchist
and libertarian socialist theorists have identified as a form of
<a href="state_capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a> or
"<a href="red_fascism" class="wikilink" title="red fascism">red
fascism</a>" - a totalitarian system that retained all the hierarchies
and exploitation anarchists oppose while claiming to pursue workers'
liberation. His legacy demonstrates the fundamental incompatibility
between genuine human freedom and centralized state power.

## Early Life and Revolutionary Activity

Born in the Georgian town of Gori to a cobbler father who descended into
alcoholism and abuse, Stalin's early life was marked by violence and
poverty.[^1] After contracting smallpox which left him permanently
scarred, he enrolled in religious school where he became a high
achiever. However, his exposure to Marx's Communist Manifesto led him
down the path of Marxist revolutionary activity. He was expelled in
1899, officially for missing exams though he claimed it was for Marxist
propaganda.

Stalin worked as an organizer for the
<a href="Bolsheviks" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>,
becoming an associate of <a href="Vladimir_Lenin" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>. His revolutionary work
included organizing bank robberies and other expropriations to fund the
Bolshevik cause - activities that demonstrated the authoritarian and
violent methods that would characterize his later rule. He was
repeatedly exiled to Siberia but continued returning to revolutionary
activity.

## Rise to Power Through State Capture

Following the February Revolution of 1917 that overthrew the Tsar,
Stalin returned to Petrograd and worked to consolidate Bolshevik
control. He helped organize the July Days uprising and served as acting
leader while Lenin was in hiding. The October Revolution saw the
Bolsheviks seize state power in what anarchists have long argued was not
a workers' revolution but a party coup that established a new form of
domination.

After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin engaged in a power struggle that
demonstrated the inevitable outcome of revolutionary movements that
prioritize capturing state power. He systematically eliminated rivals,
most notably
<a href="Leon_Trotsky" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a>, through exile and eventual assassination. Lenin himself had
expressed concerns about Stalin in what became known as "Lenin's
testament," suggesting Stalin should be removed for being "too rude" and
lacking appropriate qualities for leadership.[^2]

By the late 1920s, Stalin had consolidated absolute power, creating a
personality cult and totalitarian system that anarchists view as the
predictable result of attempting to achieve socialism through state
mechanisms.

## State Capitalism and the Bureaucratic Class

From an anarchist analysis, Stalin's Soviet Union exemplified
<a href="state_capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="state capitalism">state capitalism</a> rather than any form of
genuine socialism. As anarchist theorist
<a href="Volin" class="wikilink" title="Volin">Volin</a> noted, the USSR
represented "an example of integral state capitalism" and he correctly
identified it as a form of "red fascism."[^3]

The transformation was analyzed by various theorists who confirmed
anarchist predictions:

Bruno Rizzi described how the bureaucracy became the new exploiting
class: "The bourgeoisie is no longer the exploiting class that receives
the surplus value, but it is the bureaucracy which is granted this
honour."[^4]

Similarly, Milovan Djilas wrote in "New Class" that "There is no doubt
that a national communist bureaucracy aspires to more complete authority
for itself."[^5]

CLR James provided a thorough analysis identifying four key
characteristics that revealed the Soviet Union as a fascist state under
Stalin:

- Wage-labour remained the foundation of exploitation despite nominal
  state ownership
- The bureaucracy functioned as a new ruling class, controlling
  production and extracting surplus value
- Central planning served bureaucratic power rather than workers' needs
- Class struggle continued, with workers exploited by the state
  apparatus[^6]

Even capitalist theorist Ayn Rand recognized the similarities, noting
that fascism and state socialism both negate individual rights and
deliver citizens into the power of an omnipotent government, differing
only in superficial details and slogans.[^7]

## The Holodomor and Engineered Famine

One of Stalin's most horrific crimes was the
<a href="Holodomor" class="wikilink" title="Holodomor">Holodomor</a>,
the deliberate starvation of millions in Ukraine and other regions
during 1932-1933. From the anarchist perspective, this demonstrates both
the capacity for mass murder inherent in centralized state power and the
specific genocidal policies Stalin employed against populations he
viewed as threats to his authority.

Stalin declared kulaks (a category that expanded to include essentially
any peasant with property or who resisted collectivization) as enemies
of the state. The forced collectivization and grain requisition policies
led to mass starvation, killing between 4.3 to 9.1 million people across
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the North Caucasus.[^8]

In Ukraine specifically, between 1.8 to 4.8 million died.[^9] In
Kazakhstan, 1.5 to 2.3 million perished - over one-third of the
population.[^10]

Stalin personally signed orders on January 30, 1933 to blockade
Ukrainian citizens and those in the heavily Ukrainian Kuban region from
fleeing their starving villages.[^11] This was not bureaucratic
incompetence but deliberate policy. The Soviet leadership expressed
clear anti-Ukrainian sentiment, with General Vsevolod Balyts'kyi warning
of Ukrainian nationalist uprising and labeling resisters as "class
enemies."[^12]

The famine coincided with intensified
<a href="Russification" class="wikilink"
title="Russification">Russification</a> policies and the destruction of
Ukrainian cultural institutions, indicating genocidal intent alongside
the exploitation of the peasantry for rapid industrialization. The
United Nations issued a joint resolution in 2003, signed by 26
countries, declaring the famine a deliberate political act.[^13]

## The Great Purge and Mass Terror

Stalin's paranoia and drive for absolute control manifested in the Great
Purge of 1936-1938, where he systematically eliminated anyone who might
pose a threat to his power. This included old Bolsheviks, military
officers, intellectuals, and millions of ordinary people denounced for
fabricated crimes.

The actual number executed during the Great Purge was 681,692
people,[^14] though apologists have attempted to minimize this figure.
Stalin personally signed 357 execution warrants authorizing the
execution of 40,000 individuals, with 90% confirmed executed.[^15]

Historian Oleg V. Khlevniuk demonstrated that "theories about the
elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central
control over the course of mass repression, and about the role of
regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by
the historical record."[^16] This was centralized, deliberate terror
directed from the top.

## The Gulag System

The <a href="gulag" class="wikilink" title="gulag">gulag</a> labour camp
system represented the institutionalization of slavery under the Soviet
state. Between 1929 and 1953, approximately 1.6 million people died in
the gulags,[^17] though some estimates reach as high as 6 million.[^18]

The gulags were not merely prisons for serious criminals, as apologists
claim, but instruments of political repression where people could be
sent for the most minor offenses or no offense at all. The conditions
were deliberately brutal, with forced labour, inadequate food, and
extreme cold used as tools of control and punishment.

From an anarchist perspective, the gulag system exemplifies how state
power inevitably requires mass imprisonment and forced labour to
maintain itself. The Soviet state needed these camps not just to
eliminate dissent but as a source of slave labour for industrialization
projects.

## Ethnic Cleansing and Deportations

Stalin engaged in systematic ethnic cleansing, deporting entire
populations based on ethnicity in what constituted genocidal policies.
Between 790,000 and 1.5 million people died as a result of these
deportations.[^19][^20]

Targeted groups included:

- Koreans - forcibly moved from the Russian Far East to Kazakhstan
- Crimean Tatars - recognized as genocide by Ukraine and the European
  Parliament
- Chechens and Ingush - recognized as genocide by the European
  Parliament, with up to 60% perishing
- Volga Germans - deported to Siberia
- Poles, Greeks, Kalmyks, Karachays, Tatars, and numerous other ethnic
  groups

In the deportation of Chechens, anyone unable to withstand the journey -
the sick, elderly, pregnant women - was shot on the spot. In Haibah, 700
people were burned alive on orders of NKVD generals. Food rations were
deliberately poisoned.[^21]

## The Katyn Massacre

In 1940, Stalin authorized the execution of approximately 22,000 Polish
military officers and intellectuals captured after the Soviet invasion
of eastern Poland. This order, created at the request of secret police
chief Lavrentiy Beria, specifically targeted "nationalists and
counterrevolutionaries."[^22]

NKVD chief executioner Vasili Blokhin personally shot 7,000 prisoners.
Stalin personally signed the execution orders.[^23] Documents released
after the Soviet Union's dissolution confirm Stalin's direct
involvement.

When Nazi forces discovered the mass graves, they used them as
anti-Soviet propaganda. Rather than admit responsibility, Stalin
appointed a commission that blamed the Nazis - a lie maintained until
the 1990s.

## Collaboration with Nazism

Despite later positioning himself as the great anti-fascist, Stalin's
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Hitler in 1939 revealed his willingness to
collaborate with fascism when it suited his imperial ambitions. The pact
included secret protocols dividing Europe into spheres of influence
between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.[^24]

Stalin ordered his subordinates to "purge the ministry of Jews"[^25]
before signing the agreement. The pact enabled:

- Joint invasion and partition of Poland
- Soviet occupation of the Baltic states
- Soviet invasion of Finland
- Soviet takeover of Bessarabia

During this period, Stalin handed over German communist exiles to
Hitler, who sent them to concentration camps.[^26] Communist parties in
Nazi-occupied Europe were ordered to cooperate with the occupation until
Hitler broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941.

This demonstrates that Stalin's opposition to fascism was purely
tactical, not principled. When convenient, he eagerly collaborated with
the Nazi regime.

## Comparison with Fascism

Many theorists across the political spectrum have identified fundamental
similarities between Stalinism and fascism. As the article "USSR was
fascist under Stalinism" argues, classical fascism emerged from
revisionist Marxism, specifically Sorelian syndicalism, and shares key
characteristics with Stalinism:

- Totalitarian single-party rule
- Personality cult around the supreme leader
- Aggressive nationalism over internationalism
- State control of the economy (state capitalism vs state corporatism)
- Mass deportations and ethnic cleansing
- Systematic use of terror and secret police
- Subordination of all society to state power

Historian CLR James concluded that "If the relations of production in
Russia are capitalist, then the state is Fascist."[^27]

Even <a href="Benito_Mussolini" class="wikilink"
title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, founder of fascism,
praised Stalin and the Soviet Union as a great example of fascism.[^28]
Mao Zedong later characterized the Soviet Union under Brezhnev
(continuing Stalinist policies) as "a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, a
dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie, a dictatorship of the German
fascist type, a dictatorship of the Hitler type."[^29]

The term "red fascism" used by anarchists and some other anti-Stalinists
accurately captures this reality. Kurt Schumacher, first opposition
leader in West Germany after WWII, referred to pro-Soviet communists as
"red-painted fascists" or "red-lacquered Nazis."[^30]

## Systematic Oppression

Beyond the mass killings, Stalin's regime institutionalized oppression
across multiple axes:

**Racism and Xenophobia**: Stalin targeted ethnic minorities throughout
the USSR, from Koreans and Chinese to Greeks, Persians, and numerous
others. The NKVD conducted "national operations" that were explicitly
ethnic in character, including the Polish Operation that led to
execution of 111,901 Poles, with Stalin personally commenting "Very
good! Keep on digging up and cleaning out this Polish filth."[^31]

**Antisemitism**: Despite early Soviet opposition to antisemitism,
Stalin harbored antisemitic views throughout his life. The USSR used the
epithet "rootless cosmopolitan" to target Jews, accusing them of
"American imperialism" and "grovelling before the West." The 1952 Night
of the Murdered Poets saw Stalin order the killing of the most prominent
Yiddish writers. The "Doctors' plot" of 1953 was an explicitly
antisemitic campaign based on belief in a "Jewish world
conspiracy."[^32]

**Homophobia**: Stalin re-criminalized homosexuality in 1933, sending
victims to gulags where they faced systematic abuse from guards. This
marked a reversal of early Soviet policy and revealed Stalin's social
conservatism masquerading as revolutionary politics.[^33]

**Sexism**: While the Bolsheviks initially sought to transform family
structures, Stalinism reverted to traditional patriarchal roles,
confining women to binary gender roles and subordination to men in the
domestic sphere.

## Total Death Toll

Estimating the total deaths caused by Stalin's regime remains difficult
due to incomplete records, but the scale is enormous. A conservative
accounting includes:

- Famine/Holodomor: 4.3 to 9.1 million
- Soviet famine of 1946-47: 0.5 to 1.5 million
- Gulag system: 1.05 to 6 million
- German POWs: 381,067 to 1 million
- Great Purge: 681,692 to 1 million
- Population transfers/deportations: 790,000 to 1.5 million
- Occupation of Poland: 150,000 to 500,000
- Women raped to death in occupied Germany: 240,000
- NKVD prisoner massacres: 100,000
- Various other atrocities

**Total: Approximately 9.5 to 21 million deaths**[^34]

Most historians place the figure between 6-9 million for the minimum and
around 15 million as a reasonable estimate.[^35] This does not include
combat deaths in World War II or deaths inflicted outside Soviet
borders.

## The Anarchist Analysis

From the anarchist perspective, Stalin's regime validates fundamental
anarchist critiques of Marxism and state socialism:

**Bakunin's Prophecy**: <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> warned that Marxist pursuit
of state power would create a new ruling class. He predicted that a
"people's state" would be a "barracks regime" where workers exchange one
form of domination for another. Stalin's bureaucratic dictatorship
proved this prediction accurate.

**The State as Instrument of Class Rule**: Anarchists argue that the
state is inherently a tool of class domination. Stalin demonstrated that
changing the nominal ownership of property to "the people" changes
nothing if power remains centralized in state hands. The bureaucratic
class simply replaced the capitalist class as exploiters.

**Authoritarianism Breeds Authoritarianism**: The Bolshevik willingness
to use authoritarian means - censorship, secret police, political
prisoners - from the beginning of their rule created the instruments
Stalin used for mass terror.
<a href="Volin" class="wikilink" title="Volin">Volin</a> and other
anarchists warned about this trajectory as early as 1917-1921.

**Hierarchy Cannot Be Reformed**: Stalin showed that you cannot create
an egalitarian society through hierarchical means. The Communist Party's
monopoly on power, the centralized command economy, and the
subordination of all social organizations to state control created new
hierarchies rather than abolishing them.

**The Problem of Transition**: Lenin's concept of the "dictatorship of
the proletariat" as a transitional stage proved disastrous. Rather than
the state "withering away," it became more powerful and more oppressive.
Power, once concentrated, seeks only its own perpetuation.

## The Myth of Soviet Socialism

Stalin's USSR was not socialist in any meaningful sense that aligns with
working-class emancipation:

- Workers had no control over their workplaces
- Trade unions were state-controlled instruments of management
- All independent worker organizations were banned
- Strikes were illegal
- Wages were set by bureaucratic decree
- Production served state goals, not worker needs
- Inequality between bureaucrats and workers was vast

As Alexander Berkman wrote about the early Soviet Union, before Stalin
but describing trends he accelerated: "The Revolution is the people in
action. The people, liberated from the shackles of oppression and
exploitation, building a new life. Building it not on paper, not by
'decrees'... but by their own efforts, by their own direct action. But
for this they must be free. The Revolution must be free."[^36]

Stalin's system was the opposite of this vision - it was tyranny
claiming the name of liberation.

## Lessons for Anarchists

Stalin's legacy reinforces several core anarchist principles:

**Reject State Power**: No revolutionary movement should aim to capture
state power. The state must be abolished, not redirected to new
purposes.

**Beware Vanguardism**: The Leninist concept of a revolutionary vanguard
party leading the masses created the structure Stalin used to
consolidate personal dictatorship. Workers must organize themselves
horizontally.

**Decentralization and Federation**: Only through decentralized,
federated structures with revocable delegates can power be prevented
from concentrating in new ruling classes.

**Immediate Freedom**: The means must match the ends. Authoritarian
methods cannot create a free society. The revolution must embody the
principles of the society it seeks to create.

**Economic Democracy**: Genuine socialism requires workers' control of
production through democratic assemblies and councils, not state
ownership managed by bureaucrats.

## Stalin Apologetics

Despite overwhelming evidence of Stalin's crimes, various forms of
Stalin apologetics persist, ranging from outright denial to
justification of atrocities as necessary for industrialization or
defeating fascism. These apologists, often called "tankies," employ
tactics similar to Holocaust deniers:

- Denying well-documented atrocities like the Holodomor
- Minimizing death tolls despite archival evidence
- Claiming victims "deserved it" as class enemies
- Attributing all crimes to subordinates acting without Stalin's
  knowledge
- Dismissing evidence as Western propaganda
- Blaming the NKVD while ignoring Stalin's direct orders

From an anarchist perspective, these apologetics reveal the
authoritarian mindset that elevates ideology and state power above human
life. They demonstrate how authoritarian communism shares with fascism a
willingness to sacrifice millions of people for abstract goals
determined by a supreme leader.

## Legacy and Modern Relevance

Stalin's crimes have been recognized by most serious historians, with
the Soviet archives opened after 1991 providing documentation that
confirms the scale of atrocities. The European Parliament, United
Nations, and various countries have recognized events like the Holodomor
as genocide.

However, Stalin retains disturbing popularity in Russia and some other
former Soviet states, where he is viewed through nationalist nostalgia
rather than historical accuracy.
<a href="Vladimir_Putin" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> has rehabilitated Stalin's
image, describing him as an "effective manager" and ordering textbooks
to minimize discussion of his crimes.[^37]

For anarchists, Stalin remains the paramount historical example of why
state socialism leads to catastrophe. His regime killed more people than
most capitalist states managed in the same period, while claiming to act
in the name of workers' liberation. This is the ultimate betrayal - not
just the failure to achieve liberation, but the perpetration of mass
murder while wearing the mask of revolutionary progress.

The lesson is clear: there is no road to freedom through state power.
Any movement that concentrates authority in a centralized apparatus,
that suppresses dissent in the name of revolutionary discipline, that
elevates party or leader above the autonomous action of workers
themselves, risks reproducing the dynamics that led to Stalinism.

True liberation requires the abolition of all hierarchies - economic,
political, and social. It requires building new forms of organization
based on voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and direct democracy. It
requires rejecting the Bolshevik model entirely and instead learning
from the anarchist alternatives: the free soviets before Bolshevik
domination, the Makhnovist movement in Ukraine, the Spanish collectives
of 1936, and contemporary experiments in horizontal organization.

Stalin's shadow still falls across the left. Anarchists must continue to
oppose both his legacy and any political tendency that excuses,
minimizes, or denies his crimes.
