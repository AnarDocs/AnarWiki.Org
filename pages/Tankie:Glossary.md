are distinct from other communists due to their hardline, even
uncritical support for the actions and policies of authoritarian
countries such as

"<a   href="Russia.md" class="wikilink" title="Russia">"Russia</a>, or
"<a   href="Iran.md" class="wikilink" title="Iran">"Iran</a>. In fact, the name
"Tankie" derives from their uncritical support of tank-centric
interventions in respect of domestic and foreign problems when used by
those countries.

## Symbols and numbers

### 🇨🇳 🇰🇵 🇻🇳 🇨🇺 🇱🇦

Tankies will often display (some or all of) the emojis of the five
so-called "actually existing socialist" states
("<a   href="China.md" class="wikilink" title="China">"China</a>,
"<a   href="North_Korea.md" class="wikilink" title="North Korea">"North
Korea</a>,
"<a   href="Vietnam.md" class="wikilink" title="Vietnam">"Vietnam</a>,
"<a   href="Cuba.md" class="wikilink" title="Cuba">"Cuba</a>, and
"<a   href="Laos.md" class="wikilink" title="Laos">"Laos</a>) on their
"<a   href="social_media.md" class="wikilink" title="social media">"social
media</a> descriptions. This serves to help tankies hastily identify one
another.[^2][^3]

### 🦍☀️

Tankies (mostly
"<a   href="Patsoc.md" class="wikilink" title="Patsocs">"Patsocs</a> in this
case) will often use the "🦍☀️" emojis (usually spammed) to help
coordinate attacks against their online enemies. Despite initial
appearances, this "gorilla-sun" emoji combination likely represents more
sinister concepts, such as *machismo* and
"<a   href="anti-intellectualism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-intellectualism">"anti-intellectualism</a>.

### 1989

Tankies will, in the event of unrest in China, evoke memories of the
1989 events at "<a   href="Tiananmen_Square.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tiananmen Square">"Tiananmen Square</a> in order to demonize
anybody who disagrees with the chauvinistic and Capitalist policies of
the Chinese government as capitulating to "Western/Imperialist/State
Department propaganda", as they consider the Tiananmen Square incident
itself to be a "Western-backed color revolution".[^4][^5]

Tankies have labeled events such as the 2019 Hong Kong protests and the
2022 COVID-19 protests in China as being "imperialist
"<a   href="color_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="color revolution">"color revolutions</a>" despite their often
worker-supported nature.[^6]

### 2036

The year in which "<a   href="MAGA_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="certain American tankies">"certain American tankies</a> hope to
successfully infiltrate and reconstitute the
"<a   href="Communist_Party_USA.md" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party USA">"Communist Party USA</a> in accordance to
their chauvinistic ideology and win the 2036 presidential election.[^7]

### 800,000,000

Tankies, when attempting to
"<a   href="Useful_idiot.md" class="wikilink" title="defend">"defend</a>
""<a   href="bullshit.md" class="wikilink" title="Chinese socialism">"Chinese
socialism</a>", will often attempt to claim that the modern Chinese
government has successfully lifted "800 million" out of poverty.
However, this figure is dubious, given the fact that the Chinese
government has a much lower definition of what income is below the
poverty line, along with other considerations such as a lack of
informational reliability.[^8][^9]

### 95%

As a means to terminate "<a   href="critical_thinking.md" class="wikilink"
title="critical thinking">"critical thinking</a> about "socialist" China,
tankies will often dismiss any criticism of the Chinese economy and
government by citing the fact that the CCP officially has an approval
rating of 95%.[^10] How such a high approval rating is attainable
despite the Chinese "Communist" Party and government being controlled by
oligarchs and otherwise plutocratic, labor protections being minimal,
government repression being high, and so forth is extremely unlikely.

## Terms

**Note:** Some terms have been indirectly translated from Chinese and
may be inaccurate.

### Actually existing socialism

Actually existing socialism,[^11] commonly known as "AES", this term is
used by tankies to refer to what most commonly includes China,
"<a   href="Cuba.md" class="wikilink" title="Cuba">"Cuba</a>,
"<a   href="North_Korea.md" class="wikilink" title="North Korea">"North
Korea</a>, "<a   href="Laos.md" class="wikilink" title="Laos">"Laos</a>, and
"<a   href="Vietnam.md" class="wikilink" title="Vietnam">"Vietnam</a> (and
optionally some more, like
"<a   href="Venezuela.md" class="wikilink" title="Venezuela">"Venezuela</a> or
"<a   href="Nicaragua.md" class="wikilink" title="Nicaragua">"Nicaragua</a>).[^12]
Tankies make heavy use of this term in order to deflect any sort of
criticism of these (what are in reality largely state-capitalist)
countries by other
communists/"<a   href="socialists.md" class="wikilink" title="socialists">"socialists</a>;
most supporters of "AES" blindly declare critics
""<a   href="CIA.md" class="wikilink" title="CIA">"CIA</a> shills", "abandoners
of socialism",
""<a   href="Western_world.md" class="wikilink" title="Western">"Western</a>
"<a   href="chauvinist.md" class="wikilink" title="chauvinist">"chauvinists</a>/"<a   href="Scotsman_fallacy.md" class="wikilink" title="fake left">"fake
left</a>", etc.

### Anarkiddies

The term anarkiddies is used to make fun of
"<a   href="anarchists.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>,[^13]
"<a   href="Anarcho-communism.md" class="wikilink" title="ancoms">"ancoms</a>,
and "<a   href="Anarchism#Anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="ansyns">"ansyns</a>[^14] for not supporting
"<a   href="authoritarian.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">"authoritarian</a> regimes such as the
"<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">"Soviet
Union</a>, "<a   href="Russia.md" class="wikilink" title="Russia">"Russia</a>,
"<a   href="China.md" class="wikilink" title="China">"China</a>,
"<a   href="Iran.md" class="wikilink" title="Iran">"Iran</a>,
"<a   href="North_Korea.md" class="wikilink" title="North Korea">"North
Korea</a>, and
"<a   href="Venezuela.md" class="wikilink" title="Venezuela">"Venezuela</a>.
They might just resort to calling them
"<a   href="liberals.md" class="wikilink" title="liberals">"liberals</a>. This
can be a form of "<a   href="Guilt_by_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="guilt by association">"guilt by association</a>. However, it can
be considered a leftist slang term for crazy
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>.

### Anti-imperialism

*Main article: "<a   href="Imperialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Imperialism">"Imperialism</a>*

Tankies use the term "anti-imperialist" largely to describe countries
that do anything even vaguely opposed to the
"<a   href="USA.md" class="wikilink" title="USA">"USA</a>, and
"<a   href="NATO.md" class="wikilink" title="NATO">"NATO</a> in general. Not to
be confused with genuine anti-imperialist movements.[^15]

### Anti-revisionism

*Main article: "<a   href="Historical_revisionism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Historical revisionism">"Historical revisionism</a>*

Anti-revisionism is used basically, a
"<a   href="euphemism.md" class="wikilink" title="euphemism">"euphemism</a> for
"<a   href="Stalin_apologetics.md" class="wikilink"
title="Stalin apologetics">"Stalin apologetics</a>, similar to how
"<a   href="white_nationalists.md" class="wikilink"
title="white nationalists">"white nationalists</a> call themselves
""<a   href="race_realists.md" class="wikilink" title="race realists">"race
realists</a>" and
"<a   href="TERFs.md" class="wikilink" title="TERFs">"TERFs</a> insist on being
called "gender critical". The term originally referred to opposition
towards "<a   href="Nikita_Khrushchev.md" class="wikilink"
title="Nikita Khrushchev">"Nikita Khrushchev</a>'s reforms within the
Soviet Union after Stalin's death.

The term, however, is most infamous as the endonym used by
"<a   href="Enver_Hoxha.md" class="wikilink" title="Hoxhaists">"Hoxhaists</a>
and "<a   href="Maoism.md" class="wikilink" title="Maoists">"Maoists</a>, who
support Stalin but do not support modern countries such as China.[^16]

### *Baizuo*

Chinese: 白左, literally "white left". The term is meant to insult
leftists in Western countries who care about non-economic topics,
especially ""<a   href="identity_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="identity politics">"identity politics</a>". Although tankies may
use the phrase to insult detractors who care about human rights, the
term actually seems to see widest use among
"<a   href="Donald_Trump.md" class="wikilink" title="Donald Trump">"Donald
Trump</a> fans (both in America *and* in China).[^17][^18]

### Color revolution

A color revolution historically refers to the wave of anti-communist
popular uprisings in the late 1980s that saw the toppling of the
"<a   href="Warsaw_Pact.md" class="wikilink" title="Warsaw Pact">"Warsaw
Pact</a> governments or, in the case of
"<a   href="Tiananmen_Square_Massacre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Tiananmen Square">"Tiananmen Square</a>, an attempted popular
uprising that was brutally crushed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Tankies use it to allege that popular uprisings "seemingly" led by the
"<a   href="proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="proletariat">"proletariat</a> in countries that they like are
actually "<a   href="false_flag_operation.md" class="wikilink"
title="false flag operation">"false flag operations</a> coordinated by
"imperialist interests." Popular uprisings that have been deemed "color
revolutions" by tankies include the
"<a   href="Ukraine#Euromaidan,_Crimean_crisis,_and_War_in_Donbas.md"
class="wikilink" title="Euromaidan">"Euromaidan</a> and the
"<a   href="One_country,_two_systems#One_country,_Xi&#39;s_system.md"
class="wikilink" title="2019–2020 Hong Kong protests">"2019–2020 Hong
Kong protests</a>.

### Critical support

In typical socialist parlance, this means to criticize a person, group,
or government while standing with them at the end of the day, based on
one's personal overall calculus of the benefits/harms caused by doing
so. In tankie parlance, it could mean this, but more often than not it
means gesturing vaguely at possibly-nonexistent (or excessively
marginal/hypothetical) "criticisms" they pertain to the person, group,
or government; it often functions as a "handwave" in this way. This
vulgarized use of the phrase became so cliché that the term "critical
support for X" became something of an in-joke within online socialist
circles. Sometimes one may be left wondering whether its users have
misunderstood the *critical* part to mean "critical" in the sense of
"important", rather than "having criticisms of" the subject. The concept
can even go so far as support for anti-communist
"<a   href="monarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="monarchism">"monarchism</a>,
as with Stalin's support for the Emir of
"<a   href="Afghanistan.md" class="wikilink"
title="Afghanistan">"Afghanistan</a> in 1924.[^19][^20]

### Decadence

""<a   href="Degenerate.md" class="wikilink" title="Degeneracy">"Degeneracy</a>",
but with a coat of red paint. Sometimes prefixed with
""<a   href="Bourgeois.md" class="wikilink" title="Bourgeois">"Bourgeois</a>",
especially when
"<a   href="LGBTQ+.md" class="wikilink" title="LGBTQ+">"LGBTQ+</a>
(particularly "<a   href="transgender.md" class="wikilink"
title="transgender">"transgender</a>)
"<a   href="rights.md" class="wikilink" title="rights">"rights</a> are
involved.

### Fascist enabler

*Main article:
"<a   href="Fascism.md" class="wikilink" title="Fascism">"Fascism</a>*

While originally used to refer to centrists who acted as
"<a   href="useful_idiot.md" class="wikilink" title="useful idiot">"useful
idiots</a> to fascists as a result of things like the
"<a   href="balance_fallacy.md" class="wikilink"
title="balance fallacy">"balance fallacy</a>, tankies abuse it to refer
to anyone who disagrees with anything done by a regime calling itself
communist.
"<a   href="Ironically.md" class="wikilink" title="Ironically">"Ironically</a>,
Stalin himself can be considered an enabler of fascism due to the
"<a   href="Stalin_apologetics#Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact.md" class="wikilink"
title="Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact">"Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>.

### Liberal

Though originally used as short-hand for
"<a   href="Neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Neoliberalism">"Neoliberalism</a>, tankies often use the term
"liberal" nowadays as a catch-all insult directed at anyone on the left
they perceive as not being far-left or
"<a   href="authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">"authoritarian</a> enough, including
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">"anarchists</a>
and ""<a   href="Social_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="succdems">"succdems</a>". Might also sometimes apply to right-wing
ideologies such as "<a   href="Classical_Liberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="classical liberalism">"classical liberalism</a>,
"<a   href="conservatism.md" class="wikilink"
title="conservatism">"conservatism</a> (which conservatives don't like
being called), "<a   href="libertarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="libertarianism">"libertarianism</a> (includes
left-libertarianism), and
"<a   href="Ancap.md" class="wikilink" title="ancaps">"ancaps</a>. Most tankies
spend more time complaining about "liberals" than they do fascists.

### Multipolarity

Multipolarity is geopolitical concept in which there is a lack of a
single, unipolar hegemon which exerts influence globally. Tankies
believe that by supporting Russia's and China's <s>imperialist</s>
"anti-imperialist" actions, the
"<a   href="American.md" class="wikilink" title="American">"American</a> and
"<a   href="European_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="European">"European</a>
"unipolar" order will be destroyed.[^21]

### Mecha tankie

A mecha tankie is a socially conservative "communist" who supports
American nationalism and
"<a   href="Donald_Trump.md" class="wikilink" title="Donald Trump">"Donald
Trump</a> as well as
"<a   href="Kim_Jong_Un.md" class="wikilink" title="Kim Jong Un">"Kim Jong
Un</a>.[^22] See also:
"<a   href="MAGA_communism.md" class="wikilink" title="MAGA communism">"MAGA
communism</a>

### Nazbol

*Main article: "<a   href="National_Bolshevism.md" class="wikilink"
title="National Bolshevism">"National Bolshevism</a>*

An "<a   href="Ultranationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="ultranationalist">"ultranationalist</a> tankie, or alternatively a
tankie who is open about being a fascist. The concept originated with
the Red Army defectors to Nazi Germany, the Russian Liberation Army. The
term still survives today in one of Russia's opposition parties, the
National Bolshevik Party (Russian: Национал-большевистская партия,
abbreviated as Нацбол, English: Nazbol)[^23] though it really isn't a
coherent ideology. Nazbols may also be referred to as "red-browns",
which can also describe an alliance between fascists and tankies.

### Popular front

"We define a 'People's Front' or 'Popular Front' as an alliance on
specific issues, and the alliance is not necessarily based on class
character. This is opposed to a 'United Front,' which is a more stable
and permanent coalition of united working class orgs. It can be other
communists, labor activists, liberals, Democrats, and other progressive
groups." — comradecalzone[^24]

An effort by communists to organise any non-communists, ostensibly for a
particular campaign.

### Re-education

Brainwashing of so-called "enemies of the revolution".

### Red fascism

Red fascism is a snarl word used by some democratic socialists and
social anarchists equating Marxist-Leninism and its variants with
fascism. See social fascism for the exact opposite.

### Socialism in one country

Socialism in one country was a strategy of the
"<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">"Soviet
Union</a> after the initial failures to bring communism to
"<a   href="Germany.md" class="wikilink" title="Germany">"Germany</a> and
"<a   href="Hungary.md" class="wikilink" title="Hungary">"Hungary</a>, a
retreat from internationalism to "<a   href="nationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="nationalism">"nationalism</a>.

### Trotskyist

*Main article:
"<a   href="Trotskyism.md" class="wikilink" title="Trotskyism">"Trotskyism</a>*

Any opponents (sometimes left-wingers) perceived as covert and deserving
of enmity, contempt, disrespect, or persecution. Not necessarily
supporters of Trotsky.[^25]

### Ultra

An "ultra-left" is a leftist whom tankies and
"<a   href="Dengist.md" class="wikilink" title="Dengist">"Dengists</a> view as
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">"dogmatic</a> or
uncompromising (that is, those who don't uncritically support Russia and
China),[^26] despite the fact that most Western supporters of the CCP
are themselves usually extremely dogmatic. This term often refers to
"<a   href="Left_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="left-communists">"left-communists</a> or Gonzaloists and is
usually used against communists who don't support any of real-life
socialist states (or at least what tankies view as being "socialist
states").

### Vatnik

*Main article:
"<a   href="Vatnik.md" class="wikilink" title="Vatnik">"Vatnik</a>*

A similar but distinct category from *tankie*. It refers to impoverished
Russian jingoists who believe state propaganda. Some "vatniks" may be
tankies and vice versa, but they are not synonyms. See:
"<a   href="ruscism.md" class="wikilink" title="ruscism">"ruscism</a>.

### Western media

Tankies consider Western-owned media unreliable, so they will often
dismiss anything from them off-hand as "Western propaganda".[^27] That
doesn't stop them from consuming blatant government propaganda like
"<a   href="Russia_Today.md" class="wikilink" title="Russia Today">"Russia
Today</a>, CGTN, and Global Times.

### Westoid

An insulting term for Westerners,[^28] particularly people from the
United States. The "e" is often replaced with an asterisk.

### Yoghurts

Yoghurts refers to Uighur
"<a   href="Muslims.md" class="wikilink" title="Muslims">"Muslims</a>; it is a
portmanteau of the words "Uighur" and "yurt" (a traditional dwelling of
Uighur and other central Asian peoples). The term was coined to mock the
pronunciation of "Uighur" and to claim they are Western
"<a   href="victim_blaming.md" class="wikilink"
title="imperialists">"imperialists</a>,[^29][^30][^31][^32] a form of
"<a   href="genocide_denial.md" class="wikilink"
title="genocide denial">"genocide denial</a>.
