Participatory forces, notably the Parisian sections and the *enragés*,
played an important role in the French Revolution (1789) that overthrew
the French monarch and reshaped world politics. According to Immanuel
Wallerstein, the French Revolution made the desirability of social
change and popular sovereignty a part of global common sense.[^1]

The *enragés* (rabids), popular intellectuals of the small-propertied
class called the *sans-culottes* ("without culottes" - culottes were
knee-breaches worn by aristocrats), argued that the French Revolution
was actually comprised of three revolutions. The *first revolution*
began in 1789 and describes the overthrow of the king and abolition of
feudalism. The *second revolution* began in 1792 and describes the
establishment of the National Convention, a supposedly radical
legislature designed to supersede the moderate Legislative Assembly. The
*third revolution*, called for by the *enragés* themselves in 1793,
unsuccessfully attempted to replace the National Convention with a
direct democratic form of governance.[^2] Women among the sans-culottes
formed the Club of Revolutionary Republican Women Citizens. Leaders
included Claire Lacombe and Pauline Léon.[^3]

The limits of the French Revolution can be seen in its relation to the
"<a   href="Anarchy_in_the_Haitian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Haitian Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>. Although, by 1792,
Parisian masses did support Haitian independence[^4], the norm was not
always for revolutionaries to support liberation of the French colony
and its slaves.[^5]

# Parisian sections

In preparation of the 1789 Estates General meeting, the king set up
*sectional assemblies*, local gatherings across France that chose
delegates to select representatives for the Third Estate. Long after
they had served their initial purposes, many assemblies continued
meeting.

The sectional assemblies began governing local affairs in Paris and
other large cities. Paris's 48 sections extended participation to all
male adults, and in some cases to women. By 1972-3, the Parisian
sections assumed responsibility for policing, finance, defense and
supplies. Each section sent six delegates to the confederal Commune
governing Paris.[^6] Peter Kropotkin writes, “the Commune of Paris was
not to be a governed State, but a people governing itself directly —
when possible — without intermediaries, without masters”.[^7]

Each section organized through committees which Bookchin groups into
three categories. Civil committees handled food supply, finance, and
record-keeping. Vigilance committees handled security. And ad hoc
committees addressed needs such as finding work for the unemployed,
collecting gunpowder, planning outdoor suppers, and mobilizing recruits
for the war.[^8]

# Third Revolution

The *enragés* were popular speakers and writers who articulated ideas of
the *sans-culottes*. Jean Francois Varlet, one of the *enragés*,
advocated direct democracy across France, in which sectional assemblies
would send recallable delegates to coordinate national affairs.[^9]

On March 10 1793, Varlet and other *enragés* staged a failed
insurrection against the Convention. A few days later, Varlet spoke
before the middle-class Jacobin Club and called for a larger
insurrection, a “third revolution” for direct sectional democracy and
against the moderate Girondins who controlled the Convention. Following
this call to arms, delegates of the sections met at Eveche on 2 April
1793, and on 28 May, they appointed Committee of Six to plan the
uprising. On the night of May 30, the Eveche assembly announced Paris
was in a state of insurrection against the Girondins.[^10]

Together, the Jacobins and *enragés* succeeded in forcing the Girondins
from power. 80,000 armed people surrounded the Convention and took
over.<ref>Chris Harman, *A People's History of the World: From the Stone
Age to the New Millennium* (London: Verso, 2008), 292.<ref>

By August, however, the Jacobins turned against the enragés. Taking
state power for themselves, the Jacobins implemented a regime of terror
against their political opponents.[^11] The Jacobins' leader Maximilien
de Robespierre insisted on replacing Christianity with a new state
religion called the Cult of the Supreme Being. They disbanded opposing
groups including, on 30 October 1793, the Club of Revolutionary
Republican Women.[^12]

During this reign of terror, with Robespierre as head of state, the
Jacobins formally executed some 16,594 people by the guillotine. This
does not include those of their victims who died in prison or were
beaten in the streets. The vast majority of those guillotined were from
the lower-classes. Only 14 percent were from the clergy or aristocracy,
the rest from the "Third Estate" that the revolution was supposed to
defend. Robespierre justified the repression, saying "The revolutionary
government has nothing in common with anarchy. On the contrary, its goal
is to suppress it in order to ensure and solidify the reign of
law."[^13]

Varlet denounced the Jacobins' rule as "a disgusting dictatorship" and
denounced the Jacobins' concept of revolutionary government:

> "What a social monstrosity, what a masterpiece of Machiavellianism is
> this revolution­ary government! To any rational being, government and
> revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its
> constituted authorities in perpetual insurrection against itself,
> which would be absurd."[^14]

# Thermidor

The Jacobins implemented their own calendar with months like
"Thermidor," and on the 9th of Thermidor, which was 27 July 1794,
counter-revolutionaries succeeded in ousting the Jacobins. Robespierre
was executed by the guillotine.[^15]

Some accounts say the "revolution was over after Thermidor 1794,"[^16],
whereas others suggest that "there was a *continuity in the Revolution*
beyond 9 Thermidor."[^17] In any case, the revolution never recovered,
and the revolution was indisputably over after Napoleon Bonaparte took
over France as dictator in 1799.
