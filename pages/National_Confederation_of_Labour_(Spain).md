## History

### Founding

The CNT was founded in 1910 as a combination of the growth of
anarcho-syndicalism in Spain and many workers hostility to the socialist
UGT union. It was planned to be founded in 1909, but pushed back the
conference in response to massacres.

### Spanish Civil War

The CNT oversaw the collectivization of farmland, factories, railways,
docks, trams and the organisation of various militias.

### Repression and Survival

After the Spanish Civil War, the CNT was outlawed and its assets
expropriated by the new government. Roughly

Anarcho-syndicalism was nearly destroyed as a political force, but
remained somewhat popular with non-fascist catholics.[^1]
