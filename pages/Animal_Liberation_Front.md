The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is an international, non-hierarchical
movement of underground, autonomous groups taking direct action to free
nonhuman animals from exploitation. The ALF formed in England in 1976.
ALF cells have sometimes identified themselves as anarchist, for
instance signing their name with a circle around the A. The ALF has been
a prime target of government repression, even though the movement has
never injured or killed a single human being.[^1] *Wikipedia* estimates
that there are ALF cells active in more than 40 countries.[^2]

The ALF follow these guidelines:

- To liberate animals from places of abuse, i.e., laboratories, factory
  farms, fur farms, etc., and place them in good homes where they may
  live out their natural lives, free from suffering.
- To inflict economic damage to those who profit from the misery and
  exploitation of animals.
- To reveal the horror and atrocities committed against animals behind
  locked doors, by performing direct actions and liberations.
- To take all necessary precautions against harming any animal, human
  and non-human.
- Any group of people who are vegetarians or vegans and who carry out
  actions according to these guidelines have the right to regard
  themselves as part of the Animal Liberation Front.[^3]

According to the ALF Primer, "The ALF is non-hierarchical in its
structure, which allows for only those people involved directly in the
action to control their own destiny."[^4]

The FBI said in 2005 that the ALF, the
<a href="Earth_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a>, and
<a href="Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty" class="wikilink"
title="Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty">Stop Huntingdon Animal
Cruelty</a> were the top domestic terrorism threats in the United
States.[^5]

# Origins

In 1972, members of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in England formed the
direct action group Band of Mercy, named after an animal rights group
established in 1824. The twentieth-century iteration, led by Ronnie Lee
and Cliff Goodman engaged in hunt sabotage and destroyed animal testing
facilities. Lee and Goodman were arrested in 1974, and each served a
year out of a three-year sentence, before being released on parole. In
1975, Lee formed a new group called the Animal Liberation Front.[^6]

According to Ingrid Newkirk's *Free the Animals*, the first American ALF
cell formed when a Maryland-based woman--whom Newkirk calls "Valarie,"
changing names and details to protect people's identities--went to
England to take a two-week activist boot camp with Ronnie Lee. "Valarie"
came back and organized an ALF cell, whose first action involved the
rescue of thirty-four cats from a research lab at Howard University in
December 1982.[^7] The *Washington Post* reported, "A group calling
itself the Animal Liberation Front staged a Christmas Day raid on the
Howard University Medical School laboratory and made off with between
two and three dozen cats used in experiments, according to an ALF
spokeswoman who says she flew in from Florida for the event."[^8]

Some scholars say the Ameican ALF had earlier origins. Dr. Steve Best
notes:

> The facts of how the ALF started in the US are somewhat sketchy.
> According to Freeman Wicklund and Kim Stallwood (see this volume), the
> first ALF action in the US happened in 1977, when activists released
> two dolphins from a research facility in Hawaii.23 Others identify the
> origin of the ALF in the raids that took place on March 14, 1979, at
> the New York University Medical Center, where activists disguised as
> lab workers liberated one cat, two dogs, and two guinea pigs.[^9]

# Operation Bite Back

In the 1990s, the ALF's Western Wildlife Unit, a cell that included the
now well-known advocate Rod Coronado, launched a series of devastating
attacks on the fur industry, in the process liberating minks, coyotes
and mice. In May 1991, about 7 members of the ALF cell attacked the
Oregon State University's Experimental Fur Animal Research Station, the
United States' largest fur research facility. Three people entered
through the laboratory's bathroom window and proceeded to pour out test
tubes, smash laboratory equipment and flood research papers and files.
Meanwhile, other members used bolt cutters to enter a mink feed barn,
moved the mink cages out of the way, and left an incendiary device that
destroyed the barn and the equipment inside it. The attack destroyed 70
years of research, and just six months later the facility permanently
shut down. On June 15, the cell burned down the warehouse of the
Northwest Fur Breeders' Cooperative, causing \$500,000 to 750,000 in
damage.[^10]

Then, on August 21, in an action they called "The Night of Stars
Falling," 7 cell members trashed the Washington State University
Experimental Fur Farm, causing \$50,000 in damage and freeing 7 coyotes,
6 mink and 10 mice. The group split into 3 teams. The first team crawled
through ceiling crawl space to enter the office of researcher Joe
Gorham, who was out of town receiving the Department of Agriculture's
"Researcher of the Year" award. The team proceeded to smash Gorham's
computer equipment and pour muriatic acid over all of his files. The
second team cut their way into the mink barns and put the minks into a
wire cage in order to release them later. Third, a cell member cut
through the fences containing the coyotes. Coronado describes what
happened next:

> While most of the coyotes fled the area immediately, others could be
> heard in the distance, howling from the dark shadows of the wild as we
> had heard them before. Meanwhile, one coyote hung back attempting to
> sneak past the liberator to the last cage. The warrior then noticed
> the last caged coyote to be a young female who eyed the hesitant
> coyote with anticipation. As the liberator swung open the last cage,
> the two coyotes bolted off together into the darkness as stars shot
> across the sky in a magical brilliance. Tears soaked the liberator's
> face mask as they realized the love these last two coyotes had for one
> another, so strong that one refused to leave this hell until the other
> was also free.[^11]

In late 1991 or early 1992, 3 cell members burned down the Malecky Mink
Ranch and freed the minks inside. On February 28, 1992, the cell started
a fire at Michigan State University's Anthony Hall, destroying 32 years
of fur farming research and releasing 2 minks. On October 24, they freed
33 coyotes from a Department of Agriculture fur research facility and
caused \$150,000 in damage. The Talon Conspiracy, an animal
liberationist website, presents a supportive but less romantic account
of the action based on a journalistic book by Dean Kuipers: " In
reality, the coyotes were highly domesticated and territorial. After
being released many of them attacked each other, and required veterinary
attention. One was shot, and another killed in the fighting. All
survivors were recaptured, and the damage done to the research was
minimal."[^12]

Coronado was captured in 1994. He plead guilty to two charges, but he
refused to testify against anyone else. He was sentenced to 57 months in
prison and ordered to pay \$2.5 million in restitution to the "victims"
of his actions.[^13]

# Collaboration with Earth Liberation Front

On a number of occasions, ALF cells have collaborated with cells of the
<a href="Earth_Liberation_Front" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a>.

In 1996, ALF and ELF members jointly torched a U.S. Forest Service truck
in Oregon. Later that year, ALF and ELF cells set fire to Oregon's U.S.
Forest Service Oakridge Ranger Station, causing \$5.3 million in damage.
In 1997, ALF and ELF members in Utah cost the Agricultural Fur Breeders
Co-Op about \$1 million in damage when they destroyed the offices and
four trucks. On 21 July 1997, the ALF and ELF used napalm to destroy the
Cavel West horse slaughtering plant. In 2001, the ALF and ELF jointly
burned down a McDonalds restaurant in Tucson, Arizona, causing half a
million dollars in damage.[^14] The collaboration has continued over
subsequent decades. For example, Chilean ELF and ALF cells in 2018
spray-painted a Chilean police boat and launched banner drops and noise
bombs against the dairy and hydroelectric industries.[^15]

# Impact

The Animal Liberation Press Office provides the following answer to the
question "What gains has the ALF brought about?".

> From dozens of raided mink farms that never re-opened, to the Oregon
> horse slaughterhouse that burned to the ground and then went out of
> business, to the vivisectors whose laboratories were shut down after
> their heinous experiments were exposed, the ALF has a long history of
> success. Hundreds of other businesses have incurred increased costs

> other, cheaper ways to do business. In the words of those who abuse

Exploiters of non-human animals have been clear about the damage the ALF
has done to their projects.

> “Because of terrorist \[sic\] acts by animal activists,” says Susan
> Paris, president of the pro-vivisection group Americans for Medical
> Progress, “crucial research projects have been delayed or scrapped.
> More and more of the scarce dollars available to research are spent on
> heightened security and higher insurance rates. Promising young sci-
> entists are rejecting careers in research. Top-notch researchers are
> get- ting out of the field.” Similarly, a report to the United States
> Congress on “Animal Enterprise Terrorism” states: “Where the direct,
> collateral, and indirect effects of incidents are factored together,
> the ALF’s professed tactic of ‘economic sabotage’ can be considered
> successful, and its objectives, at least toward the victimized
> facility, fulfilled.”[^17]
