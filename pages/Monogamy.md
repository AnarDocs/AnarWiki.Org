# Monogamy

**Monogamy** (from Greek *monos*, alone, and *gamos*, marriage) refers
to the state of being married or united to a single person, applying to
both sexes. In contemporary usage, it describes exclusive romantic and
sexual relationships between two people. From an
<a href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
perspective, monogamy represents a complex intersection of personal
relationships, <a href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>
intervention, religious authority, and social coercion that demands
critical examination.

## Historical Context

### Religious Origins

Ancient polytheistic societies such as Greece and Rome attributed only
relative importance to monogamy, primarily favoring the male element of
relationships. In Rome, concubinage outside marriage enjoyed legal
status, and the gods of Olympus frequently violated matrimonial
contracts, making it difficult for their followers to take monogamy
seriously as an absolute principle.[^1]

<a href="Christianity.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, as a monotheistic religion,
elevated monogamy to a religious and social ideal. According to
Christian doctrine, the husband should love his wife as Christ loves the
Church, with children resulting from conjugal union forming a miniature
reproduction of the Christian community. This religious framework
transformed marriage into a sacrament with eternal implications.[^2]

### Legal Codification

The Christian conception of marriage became deeply embedded in civil
law. In 19th century France, for example, the Civil Code required wives
to obey their husbands and follow them wherever they chose to reside.
Court judgments granted husbands the right to compel wives by force to
live with them, while fathers retained extensive authority over
children, including the right to have children under sixteen detained
for up to one month.[^3]

<a href="Jesus.md" class="wikilink" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> himself
reinforced Mosaic prohibitions against divorce and adultery, declaring
that whoever divorces and remarries commits adultery. This religious
foundation provided the basis for legal and social structures that would
persist into modern times.[^4]

## Diversity of Anarchist Perspectives

Anarchist views on monogamy vary considerably, reflecting anarchism's
fundamental commitment to individual autonomy and rejection of imposed
standards. While many anarchists critique compulsory monogamy as a
system, there is significant debate about whether freely chosen monogamy
is compatible with anarchist principles.

### Pro-Monogamy and Choice-Based Positions

Many anarchists argue that monogamy, when freely chosen rather than
socially or legally coerced, is entirely compatible with anarchist
principles. From this perspective, the problem is not monogamy itself
but rather compulsory monogamy and state/religious interference in
personal relationships.

Some anarchists view monogamy as a valid personal choice that can be
practiced anarchistically. As one anarchist perspective notes, "i don't
think monogamy is inherently incompatible with anarchism, but monogamy
as an institution (along with most other institutions) is incompatible
with anarchism."[^5] This distinction emphasizes that the issue lies
with institutionalized, compulsory monogamy rather than voluntary
monogamous practice.

Others argue that relationships should be determined by those involved
rather than prescribed by ideology: "It is a personal choice based on
mutual agreement, and has nothing to do with broader concepts of
freedom."[^6] From this view, anarchism's rejection of hierarchy does
not require rejection of negotiated exclusivity between consenting
individuals.

Some anarchists emphasize that emotional realities matter: "I think for
many people they need some level of 'monogamy' if for no other reason
than to keep their sanity." This acknowledges that for some individuals,
monogamous arrangements may better serve their emotional wellbeing and
autonomy than non-monogamous alternatives.[^7]

A pragmatic perspective notes that both monogamy and non-monogamy exist
on continua with various relationship structures falling between
extremes: "In reality there are all kinds of gray areas in between
monogamy and 'free love.'"[^8] This recognizes diversity of relationship
practices that may incorporate elements of both exclusivity and
openness.

Some anarchists argue that critiques of monogamy can themselves become
authoritarian: "Personally, I find the (left)anarchist critique of
monogamy to be often as normative and proscriptive as traditional views
on monogamy, just in the opposite direction."[^9] This cautions against
replacing one orthodoxy with another.

The fundamental anarchist principle, from this perspective, is that
"people should choose whatever relationship dynamics work for them,
without coercion, and with the understanding that those dynamics can
change."[^10] This emphasizes ongoing consent, communication, and
freedom to renegotiate rather than adherence to any particular
relationship structure.

#### Biological and Evolutionary Perspectives

Some anarchists who defend voluntary monogamy point to biological
research suggesting that pair-bonding may serve important evolutionary
functions related to parental care and child development. Human infants
require extended developmental periods and substantial parental
investment due to larger brain development and longer maturation.[^11]
From this perspective, freely chosen monogamous pair-bonds may represent
one valid strategy among many for organizing child-rearing and mutual
support, particularly when such arrangements arise from genuine mutual
desire rather than legal or social coercion.

Research on pair-bonding behavior has shown connections to
neurochemicals such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine, suggesting
that for some individuals, exclusive pair-bonding may align with their
neurological and emotional makeup.[^12] This does not justify imposing
monogamy on others, but it may explain why some people genuinely prefer
monogamous arrangements when free to choose. The key distinction remains
between recognizing individual variation in bonding preferences versus
enforcing a single relationship structure through institutional power.

Some feminist anarchists note that in certain historical contexts, women
have advocated for monogamous norms as protection against abandonment
and to secure male investment in child-rearing, though this must be
understood within broader contexts of economic dependence created by
patriarchal property relations. The anarchist response is not to mandate
any particular arrangement, but to create economic conditions where
people can freely choose their relationship structures without coercion
from economic necessity or social pressure.

### The Institutionalization Problem

Even anarchists who practice or defend monogamy often distinguish
between voluntary monogamous practice and institutionalized compulsory
monogamy. The institution of monogamy, enforced through law, religion,
and social pressure, is seen as fundamentally different from freely
chosen exclusive relationships.

One anarchist notes the contradiction: "In some ways, a lot of
anarchists are hypocritical when it comes to monogamy. They might engage
in a dyadic relationship while supposedly denouncing its
institutionalized manifestation."[^13] This highlights tension between
personal practice and political critique.

The key distinction often drawn is between relationships based on mutual
desire versus those maintained through external enforcement: "Wanting to
be with one person more than anyone else is not the same as societal,
legal, religious, and moral enforcement of being only with that one
person."[^14]

### Redefining Infidelity and Adultery

Anarchist perspectives challenge conventional understandings of
infidelity and adultery, with some arguing that sexual non-exclusivity
need not constitute betrayal or wrongdoing. Some anarchists contend that
what mainstream society labels "cheating" only makes sense within a
framework where partners are treated as property, with "cheating"
representing theft of resources that "belong" to another person.[^15]
From this view, the entire concept of adultery depends on predetermined
rules and entitlements that anarchists reject.

Others take a more pragmatic stance, suggesting that adultery—while
breaking agreements—may represent a "blind, desperate lunge for the
extended community that we once had, from the cage of the contractual
relationship."[^16] CrimethInc. argues that the adulterer "acts, as we
do, out of a passion burning unquenchably for a new world," and suggests
that rather than being condemned, adultery reveals the inadequacy of
compulsory monogamy itself.[^17]

However, other anarchists maintain that breaking explicit agreements
within relationships, regardless of their content, represents a
violation of consent and mutual respect. From this perspective, the
issue is not whether non-exclusivity is acceptable, but whether it is
negotiated honestly and consensually. The fundamental anarchist
principle remains that relationship agreements should be made freely
between participants, with ongoing communication and the ability to
renegotiate, rather than imposed by social convention—but once made,
such agreements deserve respect until explicitly changed through mutual
discussion.

## Anarchist Critiques

### Early Anarchist Feminism

At the turn of the 20th century, anarchist feminists in the United
States and United Kingdom challenged the role of state apparatus,
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
and
<a href="patriarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
in coercing women into marriage and compulsory monogamy.
<a href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> wrote in 1907 that
men and women should arrange their lives to remain free beings in all
regards, with limits of abstinence or indulgence fixed by individuals
alone, recognizing that what is normal for one may be excess for
another.[^18]

<a href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> and other anarchist thinkers similarly critiqued compulsory
monogamy as intertwined with religious authority, property relations,
and women's subordination.[^19]

### Monogamism as System

Contemporary anarchist analysis identifies **Monogamism** as a
comprehensive system that permeates daily life and privileges certain
intimate relationships over others. This system is characterized by the
"relationship escalator" leading from dating to exclusivity, marriage,
and cohabitation, structuring society around monogamous relationships
with high social, legal, and material costs for those who challenge or
refuse it.[^20]

Monogamism functions through multiple mechanisms:

**Legal privileges**: Marriage grants over 1,000 legal benefits
including citizenship rights, healthcare access, tax reductions,
decision-making authority, and protection from testifying against
spouses. Many jurisdictions limit unrelated occupants who can share
housing, restricting communal living arrangements. Some states maintain
laws criminalizing adultery or requiring proof of fault for
divorce.[^21]

**Property relations**: Marital and family status control housing access
and eligibility for state assistance. Property and financial laws
systematically privilege married individuals, creating coercive
incentives toward marriage and disincentives for dissolution.[^22]

**Violence justification**: Monogamist ideology provides legal basis for
justifying violence. Spousal rape is treated less seriously than other
sexual violence in many jurisdictions. Jealous partners who commit
assault or murder may receive reduced charges when victims were
"cheating," extending the logic that partners are entitled to control
each other's bodies and relationships.[^23]

### The Couple Form

Anarchist feminists have identified the **couple form** as a fundamental
mechanism of oppression under patriarchy and capitalism. The couple
functions as the threshold through which women gain personhood and
social visibility, with women becoming known primarily through their
relationships to men rather than their own contributions.[^24]

The couple form mediates women's relationships to themselves and other
women, requiring constant production of desirability and worthiness of
male desire. This creates isolation and alienation, with romantic
relationships serving as supposed remedies for problems they themselves
generate. As <a href="Valerie_Solanas.md" class="wikilink"
title="Valerie Solanas">Valerie Solanas</a> observed, male-dominated
society consists merely of isolated family units, with men seeking to
isolate women from other men and from life itself.[^25]

The logic of the couple has replaced religious authority with romantic
ideology, creating an absolute position where partners become everything
to each other. This territorialization of desire prevents the
circulation of erotic and emotional energy that might enable genuine
liberation.[^26]

### Property and Coercion

Anarchist analysis reveals how monogamy frames relationship partners as
property. Under this framework, people "owe" or are "entitled to"
certain levels of emotional support, attention, resources, and sexual
access to each other's bodies. These obligations and entitlements make
genuine <a href="consent.md" class="wikilink" title="consent">consent</a>
impossible, even before considering how desires themselves are
constructed through social pressures and expectations.[^27]

Restricting behavior toward other people ensures that partners'
"resources" will not be diverted from their "legitimate owner." This
creates artificial scarcity of intimacy while preventing people from
seeking intimacy through other avenues, directly devaluing non-romantic
forms of connection. The isolation resulting from this system makes
people overly dependent on single relationships for fulfillment of basic
social needs.[^28]

## Philosophical Arguments

### The Friendship Analogy

Anarchist philosopher Harry Chalmers presents a thought experiment:
imagine partners agreeing neither is allowed additional friends, with
violation resulting in withdrawal of love and relationship termination.
Most would recognize this as morally troubling, as friendships are
important human goods and partners should want each other to have such
goods in their lives rather than imposing costs when they pursue
them.[^29]

Sexual and romantic relationships constitute similarly important human
goods contributing to wellbeing through pleasure, emotional support,
closeness, self-discovery, and countless everyday joys. The question
becomes: why not be happy when partners find additional partners, just
as we are happy when they find additional friends? Is disallowing
additional partners any better than disallowing additional friends?[^30]

### Failed Defenses of Monogamy

Chalmers systematically examines common justifications for monogamy:

**Specialness**: The claim that monogamy makes relationships "special"
fails because having additional friends does not make particular
friendships less special, nor do parents with multiple children have
less special relationships with each child. If "special" means
"exclusive," this is trivially true but meaningless. If "special" means
"highly valuable," exclusivity does not necessarily create value.[^31]

**Sexual health**: While important, sexual health concerns fail to
justify comprehensive monogamous restrictions. Contraception and safer
sex methods dramatically reduce risks, and the defense does not justify
restrictions on non-sexual intimacy. Risk assessments should be
case-by-case rather than categorical prohibitions.[^32]

**Children**: No evidence supports the assumption that children develop
better when perceiving parents as monogamous. Children primarily need
love, support, acceptance, and understanding, which parents need not be
monogamous to provide. Additional partners may enhance rather than
diminish children's care. Furthermore, children regularly experience
valued figures departing their lives without this being considered
reason to avoid such relationships.[^33]

**Practicality**: Limited time and energy do not justify restricting
relationships to one, any more than such limitations justify restricting
friendships to one. The argument that romantic relationships are
uniquely emotionally exhausting relies on monogamous assumptions that
partners must meet all personal needs, creating artificially stringent
standards.[^34]

**Jealousy**: Jealousy stems from irrational fears and false
assumptions, particularly fear of losing partners to others and the
belief that interest in others indicates dissatisfaction. Monogamy
capitulates to jealousy rather than addressing underlying insecurity,
and actually perpetuates jealousy by creating competitive dynamics where
partners forgo other options. Abandoning monogamy removes much of
jealousy's foundation.[^35]

## Compulsory Monogamy

### State Control of Intimacy

Drawing on
<a href="Adrienne_Rich.md" class="wikilink" title="Adrienne Rich">Adrienne
Rich</a>'s concept of compulsory heterosexuality, anarchists identify
**compulsory monogamy** as a system using subtle and overt repression to
control flows of emotional and erotic energy. The state, understood as a
process of capturing flows of populations, commodities, commerce, money,
and capital, similarly captures flows of eroticism, desire, and
emotion.[^36]

This state operates through "overcoding"—authoritative imposition of
supposedly true or real ways of making sense of life, erasing
alternative possibilities. Medical authority diagnoses "lesbianism,"
legal authority defines legitimate relationships, and social authority
dictates proper expressions of desire. What was different becomes merely
variation of state-sanctioned norms.[^37]

### Borders Versus Boundaries

Anarchist analysis distinguishes between **borders** and **boundaries**:

Borders are constructed as unquestionably right, denying historicity or
specificity, ignoring expressions of needs, desires, and emotions. They
claim hardness of walls and unquestionable authority of law, demanding
respect while dividing desirables from undesirables.[^38]

Boundaries are what is right at particular times for particular people
in particular situations. They suggest softness and gentleness offering
security without control, with fluidity and openness to change.
Boundaries invite rather than demand respect, recognizing diversity of
desires. They can be negotiated through ongoing open communication based
on dignity of listening to each other.[^39]

Monogamous relationships practicing nomadic boundaries involve
continuous discussion, definition, and refinement, always open to
change. Participants create space for negotiation rather than assuming
predetermined rules, with arrangements varying widely regarding
pornography, discussion of attractions, and agreements about intimacy
outside relationships.[^40]

### Capitalism and Monogamy

Growing up under
<a href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
teaches that anything of value exists in limited supply, encouraging
people to stake claims before being left with nothing. This scarcity
mentality extends into romantic life, where people measure commitment
and affection by how much others sacrifice, unable to imagine that love
and pleasure multiply when shared.[^41]

When "good marriages take work," relationships become governed by
scarcity, threat, and programmed prohibitions—the same mechanisms as
capitalist economy. When desire is organized contractually with fidelity
extracted like labor from employees, marriage becomes a domestic factory
policed through rigid discipline designed to chain people to machinery
of responsible reproduction.[^42]

The nuclear family serves capitalism by isolating people in small
consumer units, with advertising defining which gifts represent
affection, which vacations promise connection, which homes or cars make
people desirable partners. Success under monogamism requires possessing
a good partner, opening paths to higher social status and opportunity.
The couple itself is marketed as proposition of ownership—a person who
is exclusively yours and meets all needs.[^43]

## Intersectionality

### Multiple Systems of Oppression

Monogamism intersects with numerous systems of power:

**Capitalism**: Nuclear families function as consumer units with
generational wealth hoarded within family structures. Economic
dependence restricts who people can relate to and how they meet
needs.[^44]

**Patriarchy and Gender**: Women and femmes bear majority of domestic
and child-rearing responsibilities even in ostensibly equal
relationships. Desirability links to gender performance, restricting
freedom of expression. Many people seeking gender-affirming care fear
partners "losing attraction."[^45]

**Racism and White Supremacy**: Most couples are not mixed-race. When
resources are hoarded within couple units and nuclear families, this
affects cross-racial bonding and resource distribution. Settler-colonial
ideas of family limit expansive conceptions of kinship and
community.[^46]

**Ableism**: Single partners are expected to provide all care during
sickness or injury. People with chronic illness face pressure to please
primary caregivers to receive needed care. Privatized care work makes
inadequate or harmful care difficult to identify. People commonly face
divorce upon becoming sick or disabled.[^47]

**Amatonormativity**: People must participate in complex social rituals
around romantic dating to meet basic needs. Resources and opportunities
are denied to those pursuing intimacy in ways stigmatized under
monogamy. Attractiveness and desirability shape webs of material
support.[^48]

### Queer Relationships

Monogamist ideology penetrates queer relationships through
homonormativity and assimilationist politics. Rather than subverting
heterosexual social relations, assimilationist approaches fight for
rights to fit into couple form—to marry, to create nuclear families
capable of protecting property relations. Categorizations and role-play
in homosexual relationships often perpetuate heterosexual norms and
phallocratic authority.[^49]

Even polyamory, when it merely multiplies couple-form without
challenging underlying property relations and control mechanisms,
represents assimilation rather than liberation. The appropriation of
queerplatonic relationships into "queerplatonic partners" neutralizes
revolutionary potential by fitting non-normative relationships back into
partner models that reinforce amatonormativity.[^50]

## Anarchist Individualist Perspective

### Individual Autonomy

Anarchist individualists approach monogamy from a perspective
fundamentally different from both current society and traditional
morality. Considering the individual as the fundamental cell of social
environment rather than family or couple, they relativize sexual life to
individuals considered apart from cohabitation, limitation to
sentimental or sexual expansion, feelings of affective or corporal
property, and hindrance to search for desires or sensations.[^51]

The question becomes whether monogamy, even practiced temporarily,
restricts personal freedom in the sexual domain, favors possibilities of
experience and individual initiative in all domains, and functions as
good conductor of sociability. Through cohabitation and fidelity or
exclusivism, couple elements often come to resemble each other morally
and physically, representing a loss of individual faculty to reason,
search, appreciate, and choose.[^52]

### Critique of Restriction

Monogamy constantly tends to sacrifice one couple element to the other.
One element abstains from certain contracts because clauses displease
the other; they forbid themselves certain travels, attempts, or
aspirations; they renounce frequenting certain people—all because these
risk disturbing harmony without which monogamy becomes impracticable.
Thus monogamy implies abstention, restriction, repression, and
resignation.[^53]

Simultaneous association with several individualities can only benefit
the ego, functioning like voyage of discovery where encountering customs
other than those familiar, treading other soils, contemplating other
panoramas, and assimilating new dialects inevitably enriches the
explorer. Intimate knowledge of several others can bring forth new
aspects of personality that would otherwise remain buried and
sterile.[^54]

### Economic Associations

Anarchist individualists recognize that current economic conditions make
it difficult for women to manage independently. However, economic
association between people—whether based on ideological affinity,
community of ethical views, affectionate attachment, or other
factors—need not imply restriction on capacity for trial, hindrance to
seizing opportunities, or monopolizing exclusivism.[^55]

It cannot occur to anarchist individualists to propose contracts
restricting individual amplification or limiting fields of experience,
even when bringing resources indispensable to household functioning.
Economic or ideological associations should not prohibit members from
maintaining affective relations with people outside the association,
except when fearing intrusion of archist elements, suspects, or danger
to the whole.[^56]

## Polyamory and Its Limits

### Polyamory as Incomplete Solution

While polyamory rejects superficial manifestations of
monogamy—specifically one-on-one exclusivity—it typically fails to
reject what makes monogamy coercive. Polyamory usually changes terms
under which relationship partners can behave while remaining each
other's "property," maintaining frameworks approaching people's bodies
and emotional energy as legitimate property of others.[^57]

Under hierarchical polyamory, primary partners still belong to each
other with specific rules governing sharing of access to resources and
bodies—when, how, and under what circumstances access is "allowed," what
partners are "allowed" to tell or withhold, and whether partners have
"veto power" over interactions with others. These structures aim to
protect primary relationships from threats and preserve their primary
status.[^58]

Non-hierarchical polyamory explicitly rejects formulations of
relationship partners as property, yet typically accepts and welcomes
social structures centering and privileging romantic and sexual
relationships. It takes reformist approach to monogamous structures,
aiming to broaden them just enough to allow multiple romantic-sexual
partnerships or partnerships involving more than two people. It remains
assimilationist by nature, not aiming for radical changes or abolition
of monogamous structures.[^59]

### Polynormativity

Just as mainstream society presents monogamy as default or only way of
relating, polyamorous spaces often treat non-monogamy as personal choice
or relationship style rather than political position. This makes it
harder to recognize how prevalence and systemic power of monogamy
influence choices, and that people opposing monogamy cannot choose
whether they are exposed to or governed by others' rule-based
relationships.[^60]

Even in spaces claiming to accept non-monogamy, monogamist agreements
are prioritized and upheld. Guides on polyamorous dating advise asking
about hierarchy, rules with existing partners, and whether people are
"cheating." When conflict arises between pro-monogamy and anti-monogamy
perspectives, ethical rightness of choosing monogamy is assumed. Many in
non-monogamous relationships feel compelled to adopt labels like
"ethical non-monogamy," implicitly accepting framing of non-monogamy as
presumptively unethical.[^61]

### Evolutionary and Historical Perspectives on Non-Monogamy

Biological and anthropological research reveals that strict sexual
monogamy is relatively rare across both human history and the animal
kingdom. While over 90% of bird species form socially monogamous pairs,
studies consistently show that "on average, 30% or more of the baby
birds in any nest \[are\] sired by someone other than the resident
male."[^62] Even species that appear socially monogamous frequently
engage in extra-pair copulations, leading some researchers to describe
human mating patterns as "monogamy plagued by adultery."[^63]

Anthropological evidence suggests that the modern concept of lifelong
monogamy has been in place for only the last 10,000 years, coinciding
with the Neolithic agricultural revolution and the advent of property
ownership and inheritance.[^64] Genetic studies indicate that a greater
proportion of men began contributing to the gene pool between
5,000-10,000 years ago, suggesting that reproductive patterns became
more varied during this period rather than more restrictive.[^65]

According to the Ethnographic Atlas, of 1,231 societies studied
worldwide, only 186 were monogamous, while 453 had occasional polygyny
and 588 had more frequent polygyny.[^66] This does not account for the
actual prevalence of monogamy within nominally polygamous societies, but
it demonstrates that compulsory monogamy as a universal norm is a
relatively recent cultural development rather than a human universal.

The practice of serial monogamy—sequential exclusive relationships—has
been common throughout human history and may represent a middle ground
between strict lifelong monogamy and simultaneous multiple partnerships.
Divorce and remarriage, when easily accessible, have consistently
resulted in serial monogamy patterns across cultures.[^67] Some
anarchists view serial monogamy as a compromise that acknowledges both
the desire for intimate exclusive bonds and the reality that people and
relationships change over time, though others critique it as maintaining
possessive frameworks while simply extending them across multiple
sequential relationships.

From an anarchist perspective, these findings neither mandate nor
prohibit any particular relationship structure. Rather, they demonstrate
that human intimate relationships have taken diverse forms throughout
history and across cultures, undermining claims that any single
relationship model represents "natural" or "traditional" human behavior.
This evidence supports the anarchist position that relationship
structures should be freely chosen and negotiated rather than enforced
through law, religion, or social pressure.

## Anti-Monogamy as Practice

### Beyond Personal Choice

The neoliberal ideal that people freely choose what "works for them"
ignores broader political context and interpersonal consequences of
supposedly "personal" decisions. By denying existence of coercive
structures, this approach stifles ability to identify and mitigate harms
done while making these choices. In practice, super-majority "choose"
monogamy under great institutionalized and interpersonal pressure, while
attempts to analyze these pressures or critique harms are dismissed as
campaigns against freedom.[^68]

Neoliberalism has privatized intimate relationships themselves. When
frustration is expressed about partner relationships, common response is
"what they do is their business"—even when negatively affecting entire
community fabric. This denial of inherent political interconnectedness
of intimate relationships facilitates abuse and division between couple
members and between couples and communities.[^69]

Applying neoliberal logic of personal choice to monogamy parallels
absurd claims about capitalism or policing being matters of individual
preference. Just as there is no ethical consumption under capitalism,
there is no ethical relating under monogamism. This does not mean
alternatives cannot be built, even if best current possibilities
resemble temporary autonomous zones. Individual choices are not
magically apolitical when concerning personal relationships.[^70]

### Practical Alternatives

Anarchist feminists recommend various forms of struggle against
couple-form, coinciding with broader movements toward abolition of women
as class:

**Rejecting romantic narratives**: Recognize romance is not avenue for
liberation. Divest from romantic relationships as means of accessing
better world, understanding their economies and conventions as part of
continuing disaster of current lives.[^71]

**Expanding definitions of intimacy**: Make anything into sex,
recognizing bodies are rich and varied in parts and sensations. Move
away from genital organization of sexuality toward many ecstasies yet to
be felt.[^72]

**Couple-busting**: As Solanas described, barge into mixed couples
wherever they are and bust them up. Challenge mediating role of men in
relationships between women.[^73]

**Redefining social organization**: Have seminars, reading groups,
political parties, street gangs, or rock gardens more satisfying than
two people in bed. Love in ways that annihilate outworn, neurotic, and
egoistic categories of subject and object.[^74]

**Autonomous spaces**: Construct autonomous feminist spaces where women
produce their own action and discourse. Prevent single relationships
from alienating people from processes contributing to liberation and
abolition of capitalism and patriarchy.[^75]

**De-centering couples**: Once couples are completely de-centered and
society reorganized around other things, friendships will rise to fill
more primary roles in people's lives. With more intimacy from friendship
and more substantive community connections, people will not be so
isolated and deprived of emotional connection.[^76]

## Revolutionary Vision

### Historical Movement

Abolition of boyfriend and husband forms part of historical movement
superseding capitalism and patriarchy. As
<a href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">communism</a>
generalizes free access to goods, transforms space available for living,
and realizes human community, it destroys foundations and economic
functions of family while eliminating need for refuge within community.
As historically bounded relation, internal contradictions of couple-form
will arrive at conclusion, and love will no longer know territoriality
of promises, gender, or subject.[^77]

The question is not whether individual people should be monogamous, but
how systems of monogamism structure possibilities, distribute resources,
and shape desires. Critiquing monogamism is necessary focal point of
building communities that challenge these harms, complementary to
anarchist practice against other systems of power.[^78]

### Liberatory Possibilities

Anti-monogamy is not wish for utopian anti-monogamous monoculture where
all interpersonal relationships look the same, but recognition that
current choices are restricted by monogamism. In line with anarchist
principles, anti-monogamy seeks different conditions. Given realities of
monogamist world, those opposing it must remain open to building
affinity and collaborating with people harmed by monogamism—which
includes everyone, even those currently participating in rule-based
relationships.[^79]

In world where dominance and coercion of monogamism are thoroughly
dismantled, descriptors like "monogamy," "dating," or "partners" may no
longer be meaningful ways to describe relationships. The goal is not
different names for dominating and controlling each other, nor reforming
these practices, but building relationships without ownership and
exclusivity.[^80]

Liberation will only come with radical cooperation. The idea that choice
to support or oppose monogamy should be based on personal preference or
innate identity rather than political analysis is neoliberal myth
stifling dissent and preventing change. Anti-monogamy, like
anti-capitalism, anti-statism, anti-racism, anti-sexism, and
anti-ableism, represents commitment to building communities that
challenge normative expectations around affinity building, care work,
touch, pleasure, gender, ability, and everything keeping people from
living free, autonomous lives.[^81]
