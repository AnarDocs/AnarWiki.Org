**Propertarianism** is a political philosophy that reduces all questions
of law and ethics to <a href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">private property</a> rights. Despite some of
its advocates calling themselves "anarchists" or "libertarians", the
anarchist movement does not recognize propertarianism as a form of
anarchism, viewing it instead as a variant of
<a href="classical_liberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="classical liberalism">classical liberalism</a>,
<a href="neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>, and
<a href="right-wing_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="right-wing politics">right-wing politics</a> that is
fundamentally incompatible with anarchist principles.

## Overview

Propertarianism advocates the elimination of the state in favor of
absolute private property rights enforced by private agencies, or
alternatively supports a minimal "night-watchman state" limited to
protecting property and contracts. The philosophy emerged primarily in
mid-20th century America, developed by economists like
<a href="Murray_Rothbard.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> and
<a href="Robert_Nozick.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Nozick">Robert
Nozick</a>, drawing from the <a href="Austrian_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> of economics and classical
liberal theory rather than anarchist traditions.[^1]

The term "propertarian" itself appears to have been coined by Edward
Cain in 1963, who wrote: "Since their use of the word 'liberty' refers
almost exclusively to property, it would be helpful if we had some other
word, such as 'propertarian,' to describe them."[^2]

## Terminology and Co-option

Historically, the term "libertarian" was coined in the 1890s in France
by anarchist
<a href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">Élisée
Reclus</a> as a substitute for "anarchist" when that term was banned by
the government.[^3] For over a century, "libertarian" was synonymous
with anarchism and libertarian socialism.[^4]

However, in the mid-20th century, right-wing advocates of capitalism in
the United States began appropriating the term. Murray Rothbard himself
acknowledged this co-option, boasting of the "capture \[of the term
libertarian\] from the enemy" after perceiving that statists had
captured the term "liberal."[^5]

Anarchist Murray Bookchin denounced this appropriation:

> We have permitted cynical political reactionaries and the spokesmen of
> large corporations to pre-empt these basic libertarian American
> ideals... We have even permitted these reactionaries to stake out a
> claim to the word libertarian, a word, in fact, that was literally
> devised in the 1890s in France by Élisée Reclus as a substitute for
> the word anarchist, which the government had rendered an illegal
> expression for identifying one's views. The propertarians, in effect –
> acolytes of Ayn Rand, the earth mother of greed, egotism, and the
> virtues of property – have appropriated expressions and traditions
> that should have been expressed by radicals.[^6]

## Why Anarchists Reject Propertarianism

### Incompatibility with Anarchist Principles

The anarchist movement overwhelmingly rejects propertarianism as a form
of anarchism. Anarchist historian Peter Marshall states that "few
anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist
camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social
justice. Their self-interested, calculating market men would be
incapable of practising voluntary co-operation and mutual aid.
Anarcho-capitalists, even if they do reject the State, might therefore
best be called right-wing libertarians rather than anarchists."[^7]

Anarchist theorist Albert Meltzer argued: "The philosophy of
'anarcho-capitalism' dreamed up by the 'libertarian' New Right, has
nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement
proper."[^8]

### Support for Capitalism and Hierarchy

While anarchism is fundamentally
<a href="anti-capitalist.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> and opposes all forms of
hierarchy and domination, propertarianism explicitly supports capitalist
property relations,
<a href="wage_labour.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labour">wage
labour</a>, and economic hierarchy. Anarchists argue that capitalism
inherently creates hierarchical power relations between employers and
workers, landlords and tenants, and those who own the means of
production versus those who must sell their labour to survive.

As *An Anarchist FAQ* explains: "Within Libertarianism, Rothbard
represents a minority perspective that actually argues for the total
elimination of the state. However, Rothbard's claim as an anarchist is
quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public
state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person
supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing
these services from capitalist vendors."[^9]

### Property vs. Freedom

Critics point out that propertarianism does not treat freedom as an
independent value, but reduces it entirely to property rights. Iain
McKay writes: "Looking at Rothbard's definition of 'liberty'... freedom
is actually no longer considered to be a fundamental, independent
concept. Instead, freedom is a derivative of something more fundamental,
namely the 'legitimate rights' of an individual, which are identified as
property rights... This suggests an alternative name for the right
Libertarian, namely 'Propertarian.'"[^10]

Scholar Matt Zwolinski has argued that those influenced by Rothbard
could be called "propertarians" because "the concept that really plays a
central role in their research is property rather than liberty."[^11]

### Academic Consensus

Scholars of anarchism increasingly recognize the incompatibility between
anarchism and propertarianism. Benjamin Franks notes that "Increasingly,
academic analysis has followed activist currents in rejecting the view
that anarcho-capitalism has anything to do with social anarchism."[^12]

Saul Newman states: "It is important to distinguish between anarchism
and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by
the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism)."[^13]

## Historical Development

### Origins

Propertarianism emerged in the United States during the mid-20th
century, primarily through the work of Murray Rothbard. Rothbard
combined elements from the <a href="Austrian_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Austrian School">Austrian School</a> of economics (particularly
<a href="Ludwig_von_Mises.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ludwig von Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a> and
<a href="Friedrich_Hayek.md" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>), aspects of 19th-century
<a href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> (while
rejecting their <a href="labour_theory_of_value.md" class="wikilink"
title="labour theory of value">labour theory of value</a> and
anti-capitalism), and classical liberal political theory.[^14]

The term "anarcho-capitalism" was coined by Karl Hess in 1969, though
Rothbard is credited with developing and popularizing the ideology.[^15]

### Connection to the New Right and Paleoconservatism

By the 1990s, Rothbard had aligned propertarianism with the
<a href="paleoconservative.md" class="wikilink"
title="paleoconservative">paleoconservative</a> movement, advocating an
"outreach to rednecks" and citing figures like David Duke and Joseph
McCarthy as models.[^16] This alliance attracted criticism for flirting
with racism and social reaction.

Propertarianism is often associated with the
<a href="New_Right.md" class="wikilink" title="New Right">New Right</a>,
combining extreme <a href="laissez-faire.md" class="wikilink"
title="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> economics with social
conservatism.[^17]

## Key Figures

### Murray Rothbard

Murray Rothbard (1926-1995) was the primary architect of propertarian
ideology, synthesizing Austrian economics with a rejection of the state.
Despite claiming the mantle of anarchism, his work focused on
establishing absolute private property rights rather than opposing
hierarchy or domination. Late in his career, he moved increasingly
toward alliance with cultural conservatives and paleoconservatives.

### Robert Nozick

Robert Nozick (1938-2002) advocated "minarchism" - a minimal
"night-watchman state" limited to protecting property rights and
enforcing contracts. His book *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (1974) argued
against wealth redistribution and for absolute property rights. Notably,
Nozick later expressed serious misgivings about these views.

### Hans-Hermann Hoppe

Hans-Hermann Hoppe has advocated for "physically removing" political
dissidents and LGBTQ people from propertarian communities, and has
argued for restrictive immigration policies. His views represent the
authoritarian tendencies that can emerge from propertarian ideology
despite its anti-state rhetoric.

## Core Tenets

### Absolute Private Property

Propertarians advocate for absolute private property rights without the
<a href="Lockean_proviso.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lockean proviso">Lockean proviso</a> (which required leaving
"enough and as good" for others). They support the privatization of all
resources, including land, water, air, and all means of production.
Original appropriation through "homesteading" grants permanent,
unconditional ownership regardless of continued use.

#### Locke's Labour Theory

Despite their disagreement with Locke on property coming with some
responsibilities, Propertarians still justify private property through
<a href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>'s
concept of 'improvement' - that land becomes rightfully owned when
someone improves it through labour. This philosophy suffers multiple
flaws:

**Wrong Labour Credited**: Lords didn't clear forests, build irrigation
or harvest crops - peasants, servants and wage labourers performed
actual improvements. If improvement through work creates legitimate
ownership, workers who built infrastructure should own it, not distant
investors who supplied capital.

**Colonial Assumptions**: The theory presupposes uncultivated land was
'unused' or 'wasted,' a fundamentally colonial perspective erasing
indigenous relationships with land. Indigenous peoples maintained
complex, sustainable relationships with territories preserving
biodiversity and ecological balance across generations, but these
practices were dismissed as 'non-use' to justify appropriation.

### Self-Ownership

Propertarians ground their philosophy in the concept of
<a href="Self-Ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-ownership">self-ownership</a> - the claim that individuals
have property rights in their own persons. This principle, derived from
<a href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>,
asserts that people "own themselves" like objects, and therefore own
their labor and whatever it produces.

**Anarchist Critique**: Anarchists reject self-ownership as
fundamentally incoherent. We do not "own" ourselves - **we ARE
ourselves**. The concept treats humans as commodities and imposes market
logic onto human existence, creating a false dichotomy between being
owned by others (slavery) and owning oneself, ignoring that freedom
means neither owning nor being owned.

The principle suffers fatal contradictions: if you own yourself, who is
the "self" that owns, and who is the "self" that is owned? This circular
reasoning cannot establish property rights because ownership presupposes
a theory of property. Furthermore, it ignores that everything making us
human - language, culture, knowledge - is inherently collective, not the
product of isolated individuals.

### Non-Aggression Principle

Propertarians claim to follow a
"<a href="Non-Aggression_Principle.md" class="wikilink"
title="non-aggression principle">non-aggression principle</a>" (NAP),
but define "aggression" solely as violation of private property rights.
Critics point out this allows for massive economic coercion and power
imbalances while protecting these as "voluntary" market relationships.

This principle suffers fundamental contradictions:

**Selective Application**: The Non-Aggression Principle conveniently
begins after the most massive property theft in history - colonial
appropriation of indigenous lands - was already complete. When pressed
about indigenous dispossession, Propertarians offer awkward silence or
convoluted justifications about 'inefficient' land use.

**Protection of Theft**: The principle serves as a one-way ratchet,
legitimising historical conquest whilst forbidding correction of its
outcomes. It protects existing distribution of wealth and power from
redistribution whilst doing nothing to address original injustice.

**Violence Inherent in Property**: Claiming property rights requires
ongoing violence against those who would use resources for survival. The
Non-Aggression Principle actually aggresses against the dispossessed by
maintaining artificial scarcity through force.

### Wage Labour

Unlike anarchists who view
<a href="wage_labour.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labour">wage
labour</a> as exploitative and incompatible with freedom, propertarians
defend the employer-employee relationship as a legitimate voluntary
contract, ignoring the coercive nature of economic necessity.

### Rejection of Positive Rights

Propertarians recognize only <a href="negative_rights.md" class="wikilink"
title="negative rights">negative rights</a> (freedom from interference
with property) and reject <a href="positive_rights.md" class="wikilink"
title="positive rights">positive rights</a> (such as rights to food,
shelter, healthcare, or education) as illegitimate impositions on
property owners.

## Anarchist Critique

### Capitalism Requires the State

Anarchists argue that capitalism cannot exist without state violence to
enforce property claims and suppress resistance. Brian Morris notes that
propertarians "simply replaced the state with private security firms,
and can hardly be described as anarchists as the term is normally
understood."[^18]

### Economic Coercion

While propertarians claim their system is "voluntary," anarchists point
out that when individuals must sell their labour to survive, and when
property owners control access to resources necessary for life, these
are fundamentally coercive relationships. Peter Sabatini notes that
propertarianism "allows countless private states" where "those with more
capital will inevitably have greater coercive force at their
disposal."[^19]

### Contradiction with Anarchist History

Anarchism has always been part of the socialist and anti-capitalist
movement. As Noam Chomsky explains: "The term libertarian as used in the
US means something quite different from what it meant historically and
still means in the rest of the world. Historically, the libertarian
movement has been the anti-statist wing of the socialist movement."[^20]

### Rejection by the Movement

Anarchist organizations, federations, and movements worldwide do not
recognize propertarianism as anarchism. The International of Anarchist
Federations, various anarchist federations, and anarchist scholars
consistently exclude propertarianism from anarchism.

## Relationship to Other Ideologies

Propertarianism is more accurately classified alongside:

- <a href="Classical_liberalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Classical liberalism">Classical liberalism</a>
- <a href="Neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Neoliberalism">Neoliberalism</a>
- <a href="Economic_liberalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Economic liberalism">Economic liberalism</a>
- <a href="Minarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Minarchism">Minarchism</a>
- The
  <a href="New_Right.md" class="wikilink" title="New Right">New Right</a>
- <a href="Paleoconservatism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Paleoconservatism">Paleoconservatism</a> (in some variants)

It shares with these ideologies a commitment to capitalism, private
property, and market fundamentalism, while rejecting the egalitarian and
anti-hierarchical principles central to anarchism.
