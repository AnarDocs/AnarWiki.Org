## Background

After the "<a   href="Tunisian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="2011 Revolution">"2011 Revolution</a>, Tunisia was widely seen as
the only democratic success story in the
"<a   href="Arab_Spring.md" class="wikilink" title="Arab Spring.">"Arab
Spring.</a> However, the country has subsequently had nine governments,
none of which were able to tackle the country's growing economic
problems. On the 1st of January, 2018, the government raised taxes on
petrol, phones, housing, internet usage, food and makeup. Several
leftist political parties announced the organisations of protests on
January 14th, the anniversary of the revolution.

## Events

What actually happened during the protests is unclear besides the
burning down of a regional national security headquarters near the
"<a   href="Algeria.md" class="wikilink" title="Algerian">"Algerian</a> border,
50 police were injured, 237 people were arrested and 2,100 soldiers were
deployed to protect key institutions.

## Results

The protests led to a repeal of the new taxes and the blaming of the
protests on
