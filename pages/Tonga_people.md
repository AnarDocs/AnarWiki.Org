An agricultural and matrilineal people in present-day Zambia, the Tonga
are a stateless and decentralized society. Joking relationships and
marriages across clans help keep peace and order throughout the
different villages.

There appears to have been slavery among the precolonial and colonial
Tonga. Tim Matthews writes:

> "Slavery, pawnship, or clientage, as it is sometimes called, probably
> existed among the Tonga as it did among many other Central African
> peoples long before the stimulus of external trade. There were many
> complex patterns of enslavement and conventions about slavery in Tonga
> society. People were enslaved for serious offences or as a result of
> impoverishment due to famine. Slaves could also be given to settle a
> blood debt. The existence of the institution, however, does not
> necessarily imply that slaves had special economic roles. Tonga slaves
> were in fact simply absorbed into their owner's lineages and
> homesteads, where their labors paralleled everyone else's."[^1]

Harold Barclay, in the section below, also speaks of gender inequality
among the Tonga.

> no leaders. From the Tonga point of view, however, they are held
> together by a mystical bond with the ancestral ghosts. Their function

> A Tonga also belongs to a matrilineal group within the clan. This is
> also a dispersed population, but more localised than the clan
> membership. Thus, a given village will tend to have a high proportion
> of members of one kin group. The Tonga system should not be seen as a
> matrilineal counterpart of the patrilineal segmentary system we
> encountered among the other African peoples. The Tonga are not much
> interested in genealogical reckoning. There is no internal
> segmentation or differentiation between the children of one woman
> within the group and those of another. It is also not at all difficult
> to become absorbed into a matrilineal group, although, theoretically,
> membership is based on verifiable descent through the female line. The
> group also has corporate characteristics. That is, members are jointly
> responsible for providing bride wealth for their members and for
> defending their own in feuds. At the same time they share bride wealth
> received for married daughters and are responsible for taking
> collective vengeance when one of their number has been murdered,
> robbed or injured. Inheritance is also governed by matrilineal group
> membership and there are mutual ritual obligations associated with it
> as well.

> Each Tonga is involved in a complex pattern of relationships and

> becomes an honorary member of one's father's matrilineal clan. Every
> household is in some . important way a matter of concern not only to
> the husband's matrilineal group, but also to the matrilineal groups of
> his wife, his father and his wife's father.
>
> We have also said that each Clan is exogamous, but there are other
> marital regulations which have the effect of requiring that marriages
> be contracted with a wide variety of different groups, thus cementing
> alliances with a maximum number.
>
> The neighbourhood in which one lives places on one still further
> obligations with yet other, unrelated people. Neighbourhoods control
> land use and exploitation of hunting, fishing and other resources.
> They obligate residents to a system of mutual aid in a wide variety of
> activities. Each neighbourhood has its own shrine and constitutes a
> local 'church'. In connection with this church the entire
> neighbourhood becomes a congregation for mourning the death of fellow
> residents, praying for rain and good crops, purifying the land after
> homicides and celebrating harvests.
>
> Aside from residential and kin ties, the Tonga have an amorphous age
> grouping system which serves to strengthen intragenerational ties
> within a neighbourhood. A man may also loan some of his cattle out to
> others. This establishes new social ties; it also helps minimise the
> number of stock he might lose from an epidemic or raid. Finally, there
> are brotherhood pacts which guarantee peaceful movement, especially
> for trading activity between and among different contracting
> neighbourhoods.

> Villages and neighbourhoods both have headmen and the neighbourhood
