# Anti-Authoritarian International

## Overview

The **Anti-Authoritarian International** (also known as the **Anarchist
International of St. Imier**) was an international workers' organization
formed in 1872 following the split in the First International between
anarchists and Marxists. Founded at the St. Imier Congress on September
15-16, 1872, it represented the continuation of the International
Workingmen's Association (IWA) along federalist and anti-authoritarian
principles after Karl Marx's faction had effectively seized control of
the original organization.

The Anti-Authoritarian International lasted until 1877 and is considered
the founding moment of the organized anarchist movement. Its principles
and legacy continue to inspire anarchists worldwide, as demonstrated by
major commemorative gatherings held in St. Imier in 2012 and 2023.

## Historical Background

### The Split in the First International

By 1872, the International Workingmen's Association had become divided
between several ideological currents:

- **Marxist faction**: Advocated forming political parties to compete in
  elections and seize state power
- **Blanquist faction**: Supported conspiratorial seizure of dictatorial
  state power
- **Proudhonist current**: Favored worker-owned cooperatives within
  market structures
- **Bakuninist/Anti-authoritarian faction**: Promoted revolutionary
  tactics against both capitalism and the state through horizontal
  organization

Following the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871, tensions
escalated over whether the proletariat should create its own state
(Marx's position) or continue making autonomous commune attempts
(Bakunin's position).

### The Hague Congress Manipulation

At the September 2-7, 1872 Hague Congress, Marx and Engels engineered a
power grab through several manipulative tactics:

1.  **Credential manipulation**: Used General Council authority to
    control delegate credentials
2.  **Exclusion of opposition**: Italian sections boycotted entirely due
    to the rigged process
3.  **Forced expulsions**: Expelled Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume
    on trumped-up charges
4.  **Power transfer**: Moved the General Council to New York City to
    prevent anti-authoritarian control

A minority of 16 delegates (Spanish, Belgian, Dutch, Swiss, and some
American and French) had signed a Minority Declaration opposing these
authoritarian measures before the vote.

### Formation of the Anti-Authoritarian International

Just eight days after the Hague Congress, on September 15, 1872,
delegates representing Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, and the United
States gathered in the small Swiss village of St. Imier to reconstitute
the International along anti-authoritarian lines.

## The St. Imier Congress (1872)

- Tomás González Morago

**French and American sections:**

- Jean-Louis Pindy
- Camille Camet
- Gustave Lefrançais

### Key Resolutions

The Congress passed four unanimous resolutions on September 16, 1872:

#### First Resolution: Rejection of Authoritarianism

Declared that the Hague Congress majority's sole intent was to make the
International more authoritarian and resolved to reject its resolutions
and new General Council's authority.

#### Second Resolution: The St. Imier Pact

Established a "pact of friendship, solidarity, and mutual defense"
joining all interested federations against authoritarian interests. This
pact stated:

> "The federations will maintain regular communication with each other.
> When any of the federations is attacked in its freedom by the majority
> of a general congress or by the government of the Federal Council, all
> the other federations and sections will declare themselves in
> solidarity with it."

#### Third Resolution: Anti-Political Power Principle

Made the revolutionary declaration that became central to anarchist
theory:

> "The destruction of all political power is the first duty of the
> proletariat"

This resolution rejected any political organization, even temporary, as
"even more dangerous than contemporary governments" and advocated for
uncompromising international solidarity between proletarians.

#### Fourth Resolution: Organizational Principles

Established that "nobody has the right to deprive autonomous federations
and sections of their incontrovertible right to decide for themselves
and to follow whatever line of political conduct they deem best."

### Organizational Structure

The reconstituted International adopted a federalist structure with:

- Full autonomy for sections and federations
- Rejection of centralized authority
- Administrative coordination only, shifting annually between regions
- Decision-making by mandate from member federations
- No binding votes on questions of principle

## Subsequent Congresses and Development

### Geneva Congress (1873)

The first full congress of the reconstituted International included
delegates from England, France, Spain, Italy, Holland, Belgium, and
Switzerland. Key developments:

- Established rotating federal bureau for administration only
- Continued debates between anarchists and those favoring electoral
  participation
- John Hales and Johann Georg Eccarius (former Marx associates)
  participated
- American Federal Council expressed support for anti-authoritarian
  principles

### Brussels Congress (1874)

Significant debates occurred over:

- **Public services**: César De Paepe argued for worker-controlled state
  services, opposed by Schwitzguébel and others who insisted on
  federalist alternatives
- **Political strategy**: Majority maintained anti-parliamentary
  position
- **Trade union organization**: Emphasis on revolutionary unionism over
  reformist demands

### Bern Congress (1876)

- Continued rejection of statist solutions to public services
- Errico Malatesta openly embraced "anarchist" label and complete state
  abolition
- Debates between established federalist approach and emerging trends

### Verviers Congress (1877)

The final congress showed:

- **Ideological evolution**: First debates between collectivist
  anarchism and emerging anarcho-communism
- **Tactical radicalization**: Adoption of "propaganda of the deed"
  influenced by Russian populism
- **International isolation**: Formal end of the Anti-Authoritarian
  International

## Legacy and Impact

### Theoretical Contributions

The St. Imier Congress established several foundational anarchist
principles:

1.  **Anti-statism**: Rejection of all political power as inherently
    corrupting
2.  **Federalism**: Horizontal organization based on free association
3.  **Revolutionary syndicalism**: Worker organization as means and end
    of liberation
4.  **Internationalism**: Solidarity transcending national boundaries
5.  **Direct action**: Strikes and autonomous organizing over electoral
    politics

### Historical Significance

Contrary to Marxist historical narratives, the Anti-Authoritarian
International represented the majority continuation of the original IWA
rather than a minority split. As historian G.M. Steklov documented,
Marx's New York-based "International" became "barely perceptible to an
outsider" and experienced only "long-drawn-out death agony."

The Anti-Authoritarian International attracted:

- Italian, Spanish, Belgian, American, French and Swiss federations
- Most Dutch branches (3 of 4)
- English Federation rejection of Hague decisions
- Support statements from numerous other sections

### Influence on Later Movements

The St. Imier principles directly influenced:

- **Revolutionary syndicalism** of the 1890s-1920s
- **Anarcho-syndicalist internationals** like the International Workers'
  Association (1922-)
- **Contemporary anarchist federations** including the International of
  Anarchist Federations (1968-)

## Modern Commemorations

### 2012 Saint-Imier Gathering

The first major modern commemoration drew approximately 4,000
participants, featuring:

- Strong international representation, especially from Latin America
- Formal participation by anarchist organizations and federations
- Debates over program curation versus open participation
- Controversies over meat consumption and political strategies

### 2023 Anarchy Gathering

The 150th anniversary commemoration (delayed from 2022 due to COVID-19)
attracted an estimated 5,000 participants from around the world:

#### Organization and Structure

- **Open programming**: Anyone could propose workshops through online
  platform
- **Decentralized coordination**: 10-person organizing team with minimal
  authority
- **Free participation**: Voluntary donations only, no fees
- **Horizontal logistics**: Volunteer-run food kitchens serving 5,000+
  daily meals

#### Programming Scope

- Over 400 workshops, presentations, and conferences
- 48 concerts and 36 film screenings
- 11 theater performances and 7 exhibitions
- Book fair with nearly 100 anarchist publishers
- 12 venues across the village plus street activities

#### Contemporary Themes

Workshops addressed current anarchist concerns:

- Anti-militarism and responses to war in Ukraine
- Climate change and ecological destruction
- Anti-fascist organizing and strategy
- Feminist and queer liberation struggles
- Immigration and border abolition
- Revolutionary unionism and workplace organizing

#### International Participation

Despite Eurocentric attendance patterns, significant contributions came
from:

- Brazilian, Chilean, and Peruvian anarchists
- Iranian and Turkish resistance movements
- Philippine liberation struggles
- Eastern European anti-authoritarian groups

#### Controversies and Debates

The 2023 gathering saw several significant conflicts:

**Ukraine War Divisions**: Sharp disagreements between anti-militarists
opposing all war participation and those supporting Ukrainian
anti-authoritarian fighters, leading to disrupted panels and accusations
of censorship.

**COVID-19 Approaches**: Tensions between "conspiracy theory"
perspectives on pandemic responses and mainstream anarchist positions on
public health.

**Anti-racism Conflicts**: Physical attacks on French Anarchist
Federation materials deemed "Islamophobic," raising questions about
legitimate criticism versus authoritarian censorship methods.

**Organizational Tensions**: Debates over balancing open participation
with maintaining anarchist political coherence.

## Analysis and Contemporary Relevance

### Organizational Lessons

The St. Imier tradition demonstrates both possibilities and tensions in
anarchist organizing:

**Strengths:**

- Successful horizontal coordination of thousands of participants
- Effective mutual aid and resource distribution
- Preservation of autonomous organizing principles
- International networking and solidarity building[^1]

**Challenges:**

- Balancing openness with political coherence
- Managing conflicts without formal authority structures
- Ensuring representative international participation
- Maintaining focus on revolutionary goals versus festival
  atmosphere[^2]

### Political Significance

The St. Imier legacy remains relevant for contemporary anarchists
facing:

- **State authoritarianism**: Rising autocratic governments worldwide
- **Capitalist crisis**: Economic inequality and ecological destruction
- **War and militarism**: Debates over revolutionary responses to
  international conflicts
- **Movement building**: Tensions between formal organization and
  spontaneous action

### Continuing Debates

Modern anarchists continue wrestling with questions first raised at St.
Imier:

- Role of formal organization versus informal networks
- Relationship between local autonomy and international coordination
- Strategies for revolutionary change in contemporary contexts
- Balance between ideological coherence and inclusive participation[^3]

## Conclusion

The Anti-Authoritarian International and the St. Imier Congress
represent a foundational moment in anarchist history, establishing
principles of horizontal organization, anti-statism, and international
solidarity that continue to influence revolutionary movements today.[^4]
The modern commemorative gatherings demonstrate both the enduring appeal
of these ideas and the ongoing challenges of putting them into practice
on a large scale.

Rather than representing a historical curiosity, the St. Imier tradition
offers contemporary anarchists a model for international coordination
that respects local autonomy while building global solidarity. The
debates and conflicts that emerged in both the 1870s and recent
gatherings reflect the creative tensions inherent in revolutionary
organizing: between structure and spontaneity, between ideological
clarity and inclusive participation, between local needs and
international goals.[^5]

The legacy of St. Imier reminds us that anarchism emerged not as an
abstract philosophy but as a practical response to authoritarian
socialism and capitalist exploitation. Its continued relevance lies not
in rigid adherence to 19th-century formulations but in the ongoing
application of anti-authoritarian principles to contemporary struggles
for human liberation.[^6]
