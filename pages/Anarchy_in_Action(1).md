# Anarchy in Action

***Anarchy in Action*** is a seminal work by
"<a   href="Colin_Ward.md" class="wikilink" title="Colin Ward">"Colin Ward</a>
that explores
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
thought and practice through the lens of everyday human experience.
Originally published by "<a   href="Allen_&amp;_Unwin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Allen &amp; Unwin">"Allen &amp; Unwin</a> in 1973, the book was
subsequently published in America and translated into Dutch, Italian,
Spanish and Japanese.[^1] A second edition was published by
"<a   href="Freedom_Press.md" class="wikilink" title="Freedom Press">"Freedom
Press</a> in 2008.[^2]

Ward explained in the book's introduction that it was "simply an
extended, updating footnote to
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink"

## Overview

*Anarchy in Action* differs considerably from other introductions to
anarchism by concentrating on the possibility of an anarchism rooted in
everyday experience rather than being necessarily linked to industrial
and political struggles. Ward presents anarchism not as a utopian vision
for a future society, but as a theory of organisation already present
within existing social structures.

The book's central argument is articulated in Ward's famous quotation:
"an anarchist society, a society which organizes itself without
authority, is always in existence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried
under the weight of the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> and
its "<a   href="bureaucracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucracy">"bureaucracy</a>,
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
and its
"<a   href="Capitalism#Criticism.md" class="wikilink" title="waste">"waste</a>,
"<a   href="Social_privilege.md" class="wikilink"
title="privilege">"privilege</a> and its injustices,
"<a   href="nationalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="nationalism">"nationalism</a> and its suicidal loyalties,
religious differences and their superstitious separatism."[^4]

Ward based his analysis on evidence from

## Key Concepts

### The Theory of Spontaneous Order

Ward develops the theory that people, when faced with common needs, will
spontaneously evolve order through trial and error, improvisation, and
experimentation. This creates a more durable and needs-responsive order
than any externally imposed authority. Examples include
self-organisation in revolutionary situations such as the
"<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">"Paris
Commune</a>, the early "<a   href="French_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution">"French Revolution</a>,
"<a   href="Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956.md" class="wikilink"
title="Hungary 1956">"Hungary 1956</a>, and
"<a   href="Prague_Spring.md" class="wikilink"
title="Czechoslovakia 1968">"Czechoslovakia 1968</a>, as well as ad hoc
organisations formed after natural disasters.

A significant historical example cited is the 1946 widespread occupation
of army camps by 40,000 homeless people in England and Wales, who
organised communal services and federated for protection. Ward also
references the "<a   href="Peckham_Health_Centre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Peckham Health Centre">"Peckham Health Centre</a> as a deliberate
experiment where the absence of rules and leaders led to spontaneous
order and harmony.

### Dissolution of Leadership

The book advocates for leaderless groups, contrasting with hierarchical,
permanent, and privileged leadership structures. Ward argues that
studies in architecture and scientific research indicate that dispersed,
non-hierarchical work organisations that prioritise user needs and
foster free flow of ideas result in better quality and more dynamic
working environments.

True leadership is presented as fluid and functional, emerging from
individuals' self-chosen roles and expertise rather than rigid rank or
position. Hierarchical organisations are deemed inefficient because they
fail to utilise the knowledge and wisdom of workers at the base.

### Harmony Through Complexity

Ward challenges the misconception that anarchism is only viable in
simple, isolated communities. He argues that anarchy is a function of a
society's complexity and the multiplicity of its social organisations,
not its simplicity. Anthropological studies of "stateless societies"
demonstrate that effective social control and order can exist through
intricate interrelations and balances of power without formal
governmental authority.

The book uses "<a   href="cybernetics.md" class="wikilink"
title="cybernetics">"cybernetics</a> as a model, illustrating how the
brain operates as a self-organising system without a central authority,
reflecting the anarchist ideal of "equality of opportunity,
specialisation with versatility, on free communication and just
restraint."

### Topless Federations

Ward demonstrates how local groups and associations can combine for
complex functions without central authority through the federal
principle. Examples include the international postal service and railway
systems, which operate through voluntary agreements between independent
entities rather than a single central authority.

Drawing on "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon&#39;s">"Proudhon's</a> concept of federalism, Ward
proposes that organisation should begin locally with individuals
federating into communes, with higher levels serving for coordination
rather than administration.

## Chapter Analysis

The book is structured around fourteen chapters, each exploring
different aspects of anarchist theory and practice:

**Chapter I: Anarchy and the State** provides classical anarchist
criticism of government, emphasising
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Proudhon&#39;s">"Proudhon's</a> critique of being "ruled" and
arguing that state power and social participation are inversely
correlated.

**Chapter II: The Theory of Spontaneous Order** explores how people
spontaneously create order when faced with common needs, citing examples
from revolutionary situations and natural disasters.

**Chapter III: The Dissolution of Leadership** advocates for leaderless
groups and fluid, functional leadership based on expertise rather than
hierarchy.

**Chapter IV: Harmony Through Complexity** challenges the view that
anarchism requires simple societies, arguing instead that complexity
enables anarchist organisation.

**Chapter V: Topless Federations** illustrates how local groups can
combine for complex functions without central authority.

**Chapter VI: Who Is To Plan?** critiques top-down town planning and
advocates for "advocacy planning" where planners assist inhabitants in
formulating their own plans.

**Chapter VII: We House, You are Housed, They are Homeless** examines
housing systems and highlights the 1946 squatters' campaign as an
example of direct action.

**Chapter VIII: Open and Closed Families** presents the sexual
revolution as an "essentially anarchist revolution" due to its rejection
of state and religious authority over individual lives.

**Chapter IX: Schools No Longer** critiques compulsory national
education and advocates for decentralised, self-directed learning.

**Chapter X: Play as an Anarchist Parable** offers play as a parable for
anarchy because it represents self-chosen and self-directed human
activity.

**Chapter XI: A Self-Employed Society** addresses the split between life
and work, advocating for "<a   href="workers&#39;_control.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">"workers' control</a> and self-management.

**Chapter XII: The Breakdown of Welfare** argues that welfare has not
fundamentally altered the state's role and advocates for community-based
alternatives to institutional care.

**Chapter XIII: How Deviant Dare You Get?** examines the anarchist
rejection of law and law enforcement, emphasising social control through
community values rather than force.

**Chapter XIV: Anarchy and a Plausible Future** concludes by
re-emphasising that anarchism exists through libertarian tendencies in
society and explores how these might be expanded.

## Criticism

The book has been noted for its practical approach to anarchism,
focusing on existing examples rather than utopian visions. However, some
critics argue that Ward's emphasis on spontaneous order may
underestimate the challenges of organising complex modern societies
without some form of coordination mechanism.

## Legacy

*Anarchy in Action* remains influential in anarchist thought for its
demonstration that anarchist principles are already present within
existing social structures. The book's emphasis on practical examples
and everyday experience has made it accessible to readers beyond
traditional anarchist circles and has influenced discussions on

"<a   href="community_organising.md" class="wikilink"

social organisation.
