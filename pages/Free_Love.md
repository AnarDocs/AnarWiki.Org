# Anarchism and Free Love

**Anarchism and Free Love** represents a significant current within
anarchist thought that challenges state and social control over intimate
relationships, sexuality, and personal autonomy. From the 19th century
through contemporary movements, anarchists have consistently opposed the
institutional regulation of love, marriage, and sexual expression as
forms of hierarchical oppression.

# Historical Development

## Early Anarchist Perspectives

The relationship between anarchism and critiques of marriage emerged
alongside the development of modern anarchist theory in the 19th
century.[^1] While "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, the first
self-proclaimed anarchist, maintained more traditional views on family
structures and viewed the family as the most basic unit of society and
morality, thinking women had the responsibility of fulfilling a
traditional role within the family,[^2] most subsequent major anarchist
thinkers developed profound critiques of institutionalized marriage and
sexual control.

"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">"Mikhail Bakunin</a> explicitly opposed
"<a   href="Patriarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">"patriarchy</a>
and "the way the law subjects \[women\] to the absolute domination of
the man." He argued that "\[e\]qual rights must belong to men and women"
so that women can "become independent and be free to forge their own way
of life". Bakunin foresaw "the full sexual freedom of women" and the end
of "the authoritarian juridical family".[^3]
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a> and other anarcho-communist theorists similarly viewed the
nuclear family and marriage as institutions that reinforced existing
hierarchies and prevented true social revolution.

### Oscar Wilde and Early Advocacy

"<a   href="Oscar_Wilde.md" class="wikilink" title="Oscar Wilde">"Oscar
Wilde</a>, in his essay *The Soul of Man Under Socialism*, passionately
advocated for an egalitarian society where wealth is shared by all,
while warning of the dangers of authoritarian socialism that would crush
individuality.[^4] He later commented, "I think I am rather more than a
Socialist. I am something of an Anarchist, I believe." Wilde's left
libertarian politics were shared by other figures who actively
campaigned for homosexual emancipation in the late 19th century,
including "<a   href="John_Henry_Mackay.md" class="wikilink"
title="John Henry Mackay">"John Henry Mackay</a> and
"<a   href="Edward_Carpenter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Edward Carpenter">"Edward Carpenter</a>.[^5]

In August 1894, Wilde wrote to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas,
describing "a dangerous adventure" where he went sailing with two boys
and was caught in a storm. Upon returning to their hotel, exhausted and
"wet to the skin", they sought hot brandy but were refused due to Sunday
liquor laws. Wilde finished the story: "Both Alphonso and Stephen are
now anarchists, I need hardly say."[^6]

## The Free Love Movement

The **free love movement** emerged in the mid-19th century United
States, advocating for the separation of state authority from sexual and
romantic matters.[^7] The movement promoted the idea that consensual
sexual and emotional relationships between adults should be free from
state and religious interference, emphasizing personal freedom, sexual
autonomy, and women's rights.

Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to
"<a   href="Josiah_Warren.md" class="wikilink" title="Josiah Warren">"Josiah
Warren</a> and to experimental communities, viewing sexual freedom as a
clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership.[^8] Free
love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws
discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth
control measures.[^9]

"<a   href="Victoria_Woodhull.md" class="wikilink"
title="Victoria Woodhull">"Victoria Woodhull</a>, the first woman to
testify before a U.S. House committee and the Equal Rights Party's first
presidential candidate in 1872, became a prominent advocate for free
love principles. She declared: "I have an inalienable, constitutional
and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a
period as I can; to change that love every day if I please."[^10]
Woodhull was later expelled from the
"<a   href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association.md" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">"International
Workingmen's Association</a> in 1871 for her involvement in the free
love and associated movements.[^11] Indeed, with Marx's support, the
American branch of the organisation was purged of its pacifist,
anti-racist and feminist elements, which were accused of putting too
much emphasis on issues unrelated to class struggle and were therefore
seen to be incompatible with the "scientific socialism" of Marx and
Engels.[^12]

### Free Love Publications

The most important American free love journal was
*"<a   href="Lucifer_the_Lightbearer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lucifer the Lightbearer">"Lucifer the Lightbearer</a>* (1883–1907)
edited by
"<a   href="Moses_Harman.md" class="wikilink" title="Moses Harman">"Moses
Harman</a> and "<a   href="Lois_Waisbrooker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lois Waisbrooker">"Lois Waisbrooker</a>.[^13] Also
"<a   href="Ezra_Heywood.md" class="wikilink" title="Ezra Heywood">"Ezra
Heywood</a> and Angela Heywood's *The Word* (1872–1890, 1892–1893) was
an important publication.[^14]
"<a   href="M._E._Lazarus.md" class="wikilink" title="M. E. Lazarus">"M. E.
Lazarus</a> was an important American individualist anarchist who
promoted free love.[^15]

*"<a   href="Free_Society.md" class="wikilink" title="Free Society">"Free
Society</a>* (1895–1897 as *The Firebrand*; 1897-1904 as *Free Society*)
was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the
nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.[^16] The
publication staunchly advocated free love and women's rights, and
critiqued "Comstockery" -- censorship of sexual information.
Deliberately defying "Comstockism" in an act of civil disobedience, *The
Firebrand* published
"<a   href="Walt_Whitman.md" class="wikilink" title="Walt Whitman">"Walt
Whitman</a>'s "A Woman Waits for Me" in 1897; A. J. Pope, Abe Isaak, and
Henry Addis were quickly arrested and charged with publishing obscene
information for the Whitman poem and a letter "It Depends on the Women",
signed by A.E.K. The A.E.K. letter presented various hypotheticals of
women refusing or assenting to sex with their husbands or lovers, and
argued that true liberation required education of both sexes and
particularly women.[^17]

## Anarchist Women and Sexual Liberation

### Emma Goldman

"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a> emerged as the most celebrated spokesperson for anarchist
free love principles in the early 20th century.[^18] Goldman's critique
of marriage was comprehensive, viewing it as an institution that
enslaved women and prevented authentic relationships based on mutual
desire rather than legal obligation.

In 1897, Goldman wrote: "I demand the independence of woman, her right
to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases,
or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of
action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood."[^19]

Goldman distinguished herself from first-wave feminism by arguing that
women's suffrage alone was insufficient without dismantling the broader
social structures that oppressed both men and women. She viewed free
love as integral to revolutionary practice, not merely a personal
lifestyle choice. She wrote: "We are in need of unhampered growth out of
old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so
far made but the first step in that direction."[^20]

A nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women
concerning contraception. Like many contemporary feminists, she saw
abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control
as a positive alternative. She saw early feminists as confined in their
scope and bounded by social forces of Puritanism and capitalism.[^21]

#### Sex Education

Goldman in her essay on the Modern School also dealt with the issue of
sex education. She denounced that "educators also know the evil and
sinister results of ignorance in sex matters. Yet, they have neither
understanding nor humanity enough to break down the wall which
puritanism has built around sex...If in childhood both man and woman
were taught a beautiful comradeship, it would neutralize the oversexed
condition of both and would help woman's emancipation much more than all
the laws upon the statute books and her right to vote."[^22]

Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and
steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of
their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman,
indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual
love before the general public."[^23]

### Robert Reitzel

In fact, prior to Goldman, heterosexual anarchist
"<a   href="Robert_Reitzel.md" class="wikilink" title="Robert Reitzel">"Robert
Reitzel</a> (1849–98) spoke positively of homosexuality from the
beginning of the 1890s in his German-language journal "Der arme Teufel"
(Detroit).[^24]

### Other Anarchist Feminists

The Spanish anarchist organization
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">"Mujeres
Libres</a> (Free Women) aimed to empower working-class women and
challenge traditional gender roles during the Spanish Civil War.[^25]

"<a   href="Federica_Montseny.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federica Montseny">"Federica Montseny</a>, a Stirnerist
Nietzschean feminist, held that the "emancipation of women would lead to
a quicker realization of the social revolution" and that "the revolution
against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant
'future-women.' According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica
Monteseny's, women could realize through art and literature the need to
revise their own roles."[^26]

French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles promoted "unions of
egoists" based solely on mutual desire, rejecting conventional
relationship structures.

## Greenwich Village Bohemians

In New York's "<a   href="Greenwich_Village.md" class="wikilink"
title="Greenwich Village">"Greenwich Village</a>, "bohemian" feminists
and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and
also men) in the here and now, as well as campaigning against the first
World War and for other anarchist and socialist causes. They encouraged
playing with sexual roles and sexuality,[^27] and the openly bisexual
radical "<a   href="Edna_St._Vincent_Millay.md" class="wikilink"
title="Edna St. Vincent Millay">"Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> and the
lesbian anarchist "<a   href="Margaret_Anderson.md" class="wikilink"
title="Margaret Anderson">"Margaret Anderson</a> were prominent among
them. The Villagers took their inspiration from the (mostly anarchist)
immigrant female workers from the period 1905-1915[^28] and the "New
Life Socialism" of "<a   href="Edward_Carpenter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Edward Carpenter">"Edward Carpenter</a>,

title="Havelock Ellis">"Havelock Ellis</a> and

frequented by
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a>, among others.[^29]

# European Individualist Anarchism and Free Love

"<a   href="European_individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="French and Spanish individualist anarchist">"French and Spanish
individualist anarchist</a> circles had a strong sense of personal
libertarianism and experimentation. Free love contents started to have a
strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it
expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish
individualist anarchist groups.[^30]

"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of
French individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within
libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of
birth control methods, the idea of "unions of egoists" with the sole
justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not
without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and
will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within
others".[^31] Periodicals involved in this movement include
*"<a   href="L&#39;En-Dehors.md" class="wikilink"
title="L&#39;En-Dehors">"L'En-Dehors</a>* in France and
*"<a   href="Iniciales.md" class="wikilink" title="Iniciales">"Iniciales</a>*
and *"<a   href="La_Revista_Blanca.md" class="wikilink"
title="La Revista Blanca">"La Revista Blanca</a>* in Spain.[^32]

## Émile Armand

The main propagandist of free love within
"<a   href="European_individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="European individualist anarchism">"European individualist
anarchism</a> was
"<a   href="Émile_Armand.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Armand">"Émile
Armand</a>.[^33] He advocated naturism (see
"<a   href="anarcho-naturism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-naturism">"anarcho-naturism</a>) and polyamory and he came
up with the concept of *la camaraderie amoureuse*.[^34] He wrote many
propagandist articles on this subject such as "De la liberté sexuelle"
(1907) where he advocated not only a vague free love but also multiple
partners, which he called "plural love".[^35] In the individualist
anarchist journal *"<a   href="L&#39;En-Dehors.md" class="wikilink"
title="L&#39;En-Dehors">"L'En-Dehors</a>* he and others continued in this
way. Armand seized this opportunity to outline his theses supporting
revolutionary sexualism and "camaraderie amoureuse" that differed from
the traditional views of the partisans of free love in several respects.

Later Armand submitted that from an individualist perspective nothing
was reprehensible about making "love", even if one did not have very
strong feelings for one's partner.[^36] "The camaraderie amoureuse
thesis", he explained, "entails a free contract of association (that may
be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between
anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary
standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other
parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience,
such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity,
coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others,
and prostitution."[^37] He also published *Le Combat contre la jalousie
et le sexualisme révolutionnaire* (1926), followed over the years by *Ce
que nous entendons par liberté de l'amour* (1928), *La Camaraderie
amoureuse ou "chiennerie sexuelle"* (1930), and, finally, *La Révolution
sexuelle et la camaraderie amoureuse* (1934), a book of nearly 350 pages
comprising most of his writings on sexuality.[^38]

In a text from 1937, he mentioned among the individualist objectives the
practice of forming voluntary associations for purely sexual purposes of
heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual nature or of a combination
thereof. He also supported the right of individuals to change sex and
stated his willingness to rehabilitate forbidden pleasures,
non-conformist caresses (he was personally inclined toward voyeurism),
as well as sodomy. This led him to allocate more and more space to what
he called "the sexual non-conformists", while excluding physical
violence.[^39] His militancy also included translating texts from people
such as "<a   href="Alexandra_Kollontai.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alexandra Kollontai">"Alexandra Kollontai</a> and
"<a   href="Wilhelm_Reich.md" class="wikilink" title="Wilhelm Reich">"Wilhelm
Reich</a> and establishments of free love associations which tried to
put into practice *la camaraderie amoureuse* through actual sexual
experiences.

The prestige in the subject of free love of Armand within anarchist
circles was such as to motivate the young Argentinian anarchist América
Scarfó to ask Armand in a letter on advice as to how to deal with the
relationship she had with notorious Italian anarchist
"<a   href="Severino_Di_Giovanni.md" class="wikilink"
title="Severino Di Giovanni">"Severino Di Giovanni</a>.[^40] Di Giovanni
was still married when they began the relationship.[^41] "The letter was
published in *L'En-Dehors*" on 20 January 1929 under the title "An
Experience", together with the reply from E. Armand".[^42] Armand
replied to Scarfó "Comrade: My opinion matters little in this matter you
send me about what you are doing. Are you or are you not intimately in
accord with your personal conception of the anarchist life? If you are,
then ignore the comments and insults of others and carry on following
your own path. No one has the right to judge your way of conducting
yourself, even if it were the case that your friend's wife be hostile to
these relations. Every woman united to an anarchist (or vice versa),
knows very well that she should not exercise on him, or accept from him,
domination of any kind."[^43]

In the 1920s and 1930s, Armand campaigned for acceptance of free love,
including homosexuality, in his journal *L'En-Dehors*.[^44]

## Errico Malatesta

The treatment of the issue of love by the influential Italian anarchist
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a> deserves attention.
Malatesta says in *Love and Anarchy*, "Let's eliminate the exploitation
of man by man, let's fight the brutal pretention of the male who thinks
he owns the female, let's fight religious, social and sexual prejudice,
let's expand education and then we will be happy with reason if there
are no more evils than love. In any case, the ones with bad luck in love
will procur themselves other pleasures, since it will not happen like
today, when love and alcohol are the only consolations of the majority
of humanity."[^45]

# Theoretical Foundations

## Critique of Marriage

Anarchist opposition to marriage stems from several key arguments:

**State Control**: Marriage represents state intervention in intimate
relationships, granting legal recognition and privileges to some
relationships while denying them to others.

**Economic Coercion**: Traditional marriage created economic dependence,
particularly for women, preventing genuine free choice in relationships.
Free lovers advocated voluntary sexual unions with no state
interference[^46] and affirmed the right to sexual pleasure for both
women and men, sometimes explicitly supporting the rights of homosexuals
and prostitutes.

**Sexual Hierarchy**: Marriage established sexual exclusivity as a moral
imperative, creating artificial scarcity around love and intimacy.

**Gender Oppression**: Marriage laws historically granted men legal
authority over women's bodies, property, and decisions.

## Individual Autonomy vs. Social Bonds

Anarchist free love advocates navigated the tension between individual
autonomy and community solidarity. Unlike liberal individualism,
anarchist approaches emphasized that true individual freedom required
dismantling all hierarchical structures that limited authentic human
connection.

"<a   href="Émile_Armand.md" class="wikilink" title="Émile Armand">"Émile
Armand</a> and other European individualist anarchists developed
theories of "amorous "<a   href="Companionship.md" class="wikilink"
title="comradeship">"comradeship</a>" that sought to eliminate
possessiveness and jealousy while maintaining deep emotional bonds.[^47]

# Anarcha-Feminism

Since the 1860s, anarchism's radical critique of capitalism and the
state has been combined with a critique of patriarchy. Anarcha-feminists
thus start from the precept that modern society is dominated by men.
Authoritarian traits and values—domination, exploitation, aggression,
competition. etc.—are integral to hierarchical civilizations and are
seen as "masculine". In contrast, non-authoritarian traits and
values—cooperation, sharing, compassion, sensitivity—are regarded as
"feminine", and devalued. Anarcha-feminists have thus espoused creation
of a non-authoritarian, anarchist society. They refer to the creation of
a society, based on cooperation, sharing, mutual aid, etc. as the
"feminization of society."[^48]

Anarcha-feminism was inspired by late 19th and early 20th century
authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a>, "<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">"Voltairine de Cleyre</a> and
"<a   href="Lucy_Parsons.md" class="wikilink" title="Lucy Parsons">"Lucy
Parsons</a>.[^49]

## Mujeres Libres

Mujeres Libres (Free Women) was an anarchist women's organization in
Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936
by "<a   href="Lucía_Sánchez_Saornil.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lucía Sánchez Saornil">"Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a>,
"<a   href="Mercedes_Comaposada.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mercedes Comaposada">"Mercedes Comaposada</a> and
"<a   href="Amparo_Poch_y_Gascón.md" class="wikilink"
title="Amparo Poch y Gascón">"Amparo Poch y Gascón</a> and had
approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of
a "double struggle" for women's liberation and social revolution and
argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be
pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created
networks of women anarchists. Flying day-care centres were set up in
efforts to involve more women in union activities.[^50]

In revolutionary Spain of the 1930s, many anarchist women were angry
with what they viewed as persistent sexism amongst anarchist men and
their marginalized status within a movement that ostensibly sought to
abolish domination and hierarchy. They saw women's problems as
inseparable from the social problems of the day; while they shared their
compañero's desire for social revolution they also pushed for
recognition of women's abilities and organized in their communities to
achieve that goal. Citing the anarchist assertion that the means of
revolutionary struggle must model the desired organization of
revolutionary society, they rejected mainstream Spanish anarchism's
assertion that women's equality would follow automatically from the
social revolution. To prepare women for leadership roles in the
anarchist movement, they organized schools, women-only social groups and
a women-only newspaper so that women could gain self-esteem and
confidence in their abilities and network with one another to develop
their political consciousness.[^51]

### Lucía Sánchez Saornil

"<a   href="Lucía_Sánchez_Saornil.md" class="wikilink"
title="Lucía Sánchez Saornil">"Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a> was a main
founder of the Spanish anarcha-feminist federation
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">"Mujeres
Libres</a> who was open about her lesbianism.[^52] At a young age she
began writing poetry and associated herself with the emerging Ultraist
literary movement. By 1919, she had been published in a variety of
journals, including *Los Quijotes*, *Tableros*, *Plural*, *Manantial*
and *La Gaceta Literaria*. Working under a male pen name, she was able
to explore lesbian themes[^53] at a time when homosexuality was
criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment.

Dissatisfied with the chauvinistic prejudices of fellow republicans,
Lucía Sánchez Saornil joined with two compañeras,
"<a   href="Mercedes_Comaposada.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mercedes Comaposada">"Mercedes Comaposada</a> and
"<a   href="Amparo_Poch_y_Gascón.md" class="wikilink"
title="Amparo Poch y Gascón">"Amparo Poch y Gascón</a>, to form
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">"Mujeres
Libres</a> in 1936. Mujeres Libres was an autonomous anarchist
organization for women committed to a "double struggle" of women's
liberation and social revolution. Lucía and other "Free Women" rejected
the dominant view that gender equality would emerge naturally from a
classless society. As the Spanish Civil War exploded, Mujeres Libres
quickly grew to 30,000 members, organizing women's social spaces,
schools, newspapers and daycare programs.[^54]

# Queer Anarchism

Anarchism's foregrounding of individual freedoms made for a natural
marriage with homosexuality in the eyes of many, both inside and outside
of the Anarchist movement.
"<a   href="Emil_Szittya.md" class="wikilink" title="Emil Szittya">"Emil
Szittya</a>, in *Das Kuriositäten-Kabinett* (1923), wrote about
homosexuality that "very many anarchists have this tendency. Thus I
found in Paris a Hungarian anarchist, Alexander Sommi, who founded a
homosexual anarchist group on the basis of this idea." His view is
confirmed by "<a   href="Magnus_Hirschfeld.md" class="wikilink"
title="Magnus Hirschfeld">"Magnus Hirschfeld</a> in his 1914 book *Die
Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes*: "In the ranks of a relatively
small party, the anarchist, it seemed to me as if proportionately more
homosexuals and effeminates are found than in others." Italian anarchist
"<a   href="Luigi_Bertoni.md" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Bertoni">"Luigi
Bertoni</a> (whom Szittya also believed to be homosexual) observed that
"Anarchists demand freedom in everything, thus also in sexuality.
Homosexuality leads to a healthy sense of egoism, for which every
anarchist should strive."[^55]

## Early German Activists

Anarcho-syndicalist writer Ulrich Linse wrote about "a sharply outlined
figure of the Berlin individualist anarchist cultural scene around
1900", the "precocious "<a   href="Johannes_Holzmann.md" class="wikilink"
title="Johannes Holzmann">"Johannes Holzmann</a>" (known as Senna Hoy):
"an adherent of free love, \[Hoy\] celebrated homosexuality as a
'champion of culture' and engaged in the struggle against Paragraph
175."[^56] The young Hoy (born 1882) published these views in his weekly
magazine, ("Kampf") from 1904 which reached a circulation of 10,000 the
following year.

German anarchist psychotherapist
"<a   href="Otto_Gross.md" class="wikilink" title="Otto Gross">"Otto Gross</a>
also wrote extensively about same-sex sexuality in both men and women
and argued against its discrimination.[^57]

## Adolf Brand and Der Eigene

From 1906, the writings and theories of
"<a   href="John_Henry_Mackay.md" class="wikilink"
title="John Henry Mackay">"John Henry Mackay</a> had a significant
influence on Adolf Brand's organisation Gemeinschaft der Eigenen. The
individualist anarchist Adolf Brand was originally a member of
Hirschfeld's Scientific-Humanitarian committee, but formed a break-away
group. Brand and his colleagues, known as the Gemeinschaft der Eigenen,
were heavily influenced by homosexual anarchist
"<a   href="John_Henry_Mackay.md" class="wikilink"
title="John Henry Mackay">"John Henry Mackay</a>. They were opposed to
Hirschfeld's medical characterisation of homosexuality as the domain of
an "intermediate sex".[^58]

*"<a   href="Der_Eigene.md" class="wikilink" title="Der Eigene">"Der Eigene</a>*
was the first Gay journal in the world, published from 1896 to 1932 by
"<a   href="Adolf_Brand.md" class="wikilink" title="Adolf Brand">"Adolf

an average of around 1500 subscribers per issue during its run, but the

## Daniel Guérin

"<a   href="Daniel_Guérin.md" class="wikilink" title="Daniel Guérin">"Daniel
Guérin</a> was a leading figure in the French Left from the 1930s until
his death in 1988. After coming out in 1965, he spoke about the extreme
hostility toward homosexuality that permeated the Left throughout much
of the 20th century.[^60]

"Not so many years ago, to declare oneself a revolutionary and to
confess to being homosexual were incompatible," Guérin wrote in
1975.[^61] In 1954, Guérin was widely attacked for his study of the
Kinsey Reports in which he also detailed the oppression of homosexuals
in France: "The harshest \[criticisms\] came from Marxists, who tend
seriously to underestimate the form of oppression which is antisexual
terrorism. I expected it, of course, and I knew that in publishing my
book I was running the risk of being attacked by those to whom I feel
closest on a political level."[^62]

After coming out publicly in 1965, Guérin was abandoned by the Left, and
his papers on sexual liberation were censored or refused publication in
left-wing journals.[^63] From the 1950s, Guérin moved away from
Marxism-Leninism and toward a synthesis of anarchism and communism which
allowed for individualism while rejecting capitalism. Guérin was
involved in the uprising of May 1968, and was a part of the French Gay
Liberation movement that emerged after the events. Decades later,
Frédéric Martel described Guérin as the "grandfather of the French
homosexual movement."[^64]

## Anarchist Homophobia

Despite these supportive stances, the anarchist movement of the time
certainly wasn't free from homophobia: an editorial in an influential
Spanish anarchist journal from 1935 argued that an Anarchist shouldn't
even associate with homosexuals, let alone be one: "If you are an
anarchist, that means that you are more morally upright and physically
strong than the average man. And he who likes inverts is no real man,
and is therefore no real anarchist."[^65]

# Contemporary Developments

## Polyamory and Anarchism

Modern
"<a   href="polyamory.md" class="wikilink" title="polyamory">"polyamory</a>
movements have drawn inspiration from anarchist free love traditions
while developing distinct approaches to multiple relationships.
Polyamory emphasizes ethical non-monogamy with informed consent of all
parties, often maintaining some relationship hierarchies that anarchist
approaches would reject.

## Relationship Anarchy

**"<a   href="Relationship_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Relationship Anarchy">"Relationship Anarchy</a>** represents the
most direct contemporary application of anarchist principles to intimate
relationships. Popularized by Andie Nordgren in 2012, relationship
anarchy rejects all predetermined relationship structures, hierarchies,
and social expectations about how relationships should develop.

Key principles of relationship anarchy include:

- **Anti-hierarchy**: Refusing to prioritize romantic relationships over
  friendships or other connections
- **Anti-normativity**: Rejecting social scripts about relationship
  progression and commitment
- **Autonomy**: Maintaining individual self-determination within all
  relationships
- **Community**: Emphasizing interconnection and mutual aid over
  couple-centric models

Relationship anarchy explicitly connects personal relationship choices
to broader political resistance against social control and
normalization.[^66]

## Contemporary Anarchist Groups

Queer Fist appeared in New York City and identifies itself as "an
anti-assimilationist, anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian street action
group, came together to provide direct action and a radical queer and
trans-identified voice at the Republican National Convention (RNC)
protests."[^67]

Anarcha-feminism continues in new forms such as the Bolivian collective
"<a   href="Mujeres_Creando.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mujeres Creando">"Mujeres Creando</a> or the Spanish
anarcha-feminist squat "<a   href="Eskalera_Karakola.md" class="wikilink"
title="Eskalera Karakola">"Eskalera Karakola</a>. Contemporary
anarcha-feminist writers/theorists include
"<a   href="L._Susan_Brown.md" class="wikilink" title="L. Susan Brown">"L.
Susan Brown</a> and the eco-feminist
"<a   href="Starhawk.md" class="wikilink" title="Starhawk">"Starhawk</a>.[^68]

## Queer Anarchism

Contemporary
"<a   href="queer_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="queer anarchism">"queer
anarchism</a> has expanded anarchist critiques of heteronormativity and
traditional relationship structures. Queer anarchists view compulsory
heterosexuality, monogamy, and binary gender roles as interconnected
systems of oppression that must be dismantled alongside capitalism and
the state.

# Shift in Contemporary Anarchism

## Reduced Emphasis on Sexual Politics

Modern anarchist movements tend to make less of an issue of free love
compared to classical anarchists, for several interconnected reasons:

**Integration of Feminist Gains**: Many legal barriers to women's sexual
autonomy that classical anarchists fought against have been formally
removed, though structural inequalities persist.

**Broader Focus**: Contemporary anarchist movements often prioritize
issues like ecological destruction, racial justice, and economic
inequality, viewing sexual liberation as one component of broader social
transformation rather than a central organizing principle.

**Cultural Shifts**: The sexual revolution of the 1960s and subsequent
cultural changes normalized many practices that early anarchists
advocated, reducing the revolutionary potential of sexual liberation as
a political strategy.

**Diversity of Approaches**: Modern anarchist movements encompass
greater diversity in personal choices, with some anarchists choosing
traditional relationship structures while maintaining political
commitments to dismantling oppressive institutions.

## Institutionalization and Co-optation

Some contemporary anarchists argue that certain aspects of the free love
movement have been co-opted by capitalist consumer culture, with sexual
liberation repackaged as individual lifestyle choices rather than
collective resistance to authority.

## Contemporary Theoretical Contributions

The British anarcho-pacifist
"<a   href="Alex_Comfort.md" class="wikilink" title="Alex Comfort">"Alex
Comfort</a> gained notoriety for writing the bestseller sex manual
*"<a   href="The_Joy_of_Sex.md" class="wikilink" title="The Joy of Sex">"The Joy
of Sex</a>* (1972) in the context of the sexual revolution.[^69]

The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French
anarcho-hedonist philosopher
"<a   href="Michel_Onfray.md" class="wikilink" title="Michel Onfray">"Michel
Onfray</a> in such works as *Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une
érotique solaire* (2000) and *L'invention du plaisir : fragments
cyréaniques* (2002).[^70]

## Anarchists in the Sex Industry

"Anarchists in high heels" are anarchists (or sometimes radicals or
libertarians) who work in the sex industry. The term can be found being
used in *XXX: A Womanʼs Right to Pornography* by
"<a   href="Wendy_McElroy.md" class="wikilink" title="Wendy McElroy">"Wendy
McElroy</a> where porn actress,
"<a   href="Veronica_Hart.md" class="wikilink" title="Veronica Hart">"Veronica
Hart</a>, makes this comment upon hearing the word 'feminist':

"I donʼt need
"<a   href="Andrea_Dworkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Andrea Dworkin">"Andrea
Dworkin</a> to tell me what to think or how to behave." \[...\] "And I
donʼt appreciate being called psychologically damaged! I have friends in
the business who call themselves 'Anarchists in High Heels.' Theyʼd love
to have a word with her."[^71]

In 1993, the "Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade" criticized "anti-porn
activists who are frankly censorious".[^72]

# Criticism and Debates

## Internal Anarchist Tensions

Not all anarchists have embraced free love principles. Some have argued
that sexual liberation can distract from class struggle or revolutionary
organizing. Others have raised concerns about how free love practices
might reproduce gendered power dynamics rather than challenging them.

## Feminist Critiques

Some feminist anarchists have critiqued certain free love practices as
potentially exploitative, particularly when they occur within broader
social contexts that continue to disadvantage women economically and
socially.

# Legacy and Influence

The anarchist free love tradition has significantly influenced
contemporary movements for sexual liberation, LGBTQ+ rights, and
alternative relationship structures. Its emphasis on dismantling
hierarchical control over intimate life continues to inspire activists
challenging heteronormativity, compulsory
"<a   href="monogamy.md" class="wikilink" title="monogamy">"monogamy</a>, and
state regulation of personal relationships.

Modern relationship anarchy,
"<a   href="polyamory.md" class="wikilink" title="polyamory">"polyamory</a>,
and "<a   href="queer.md" class="wikilink" title="queer">"queer</a> liberation
movements all draw from this tradition while adapting anarchist
principles to contemporary contexts and understanding of gender,
sexuality, and power.

[^60]: The Parti Communiste Français was "hysterically intransigent as
    far as 'moral behaviour' was concerned" (Aragon, victime et
    profiteur du tabou, in Gai Pied Hebdo, 4 June 1983, reproduced in
    Homosexualité et Révolution, pp. 62-3, quote p. 63.); The trotskyist
    Pierre Lambert's OCI was "completely hysterical with regard to
    homosexuality"; Lutte ouvrière was theoretically opposed to
    homosexuality; as was the Ligue communiste, despite their belatedly
    paying lip service to gay lib. (à confesse, Interview with Gérard
    Ponthieu in Sexpol, no. 1 (20 January 1975), pp.10-14.) Together,
    Guérin argued, such groups bore a great deal of responsibility for
    fostering homophobic attitudes among the working class as late as
    the 1970s. Their attitude was "the most blinkered, the most
    reactionary, the most antiscientific". ("Etre homosexuel et
