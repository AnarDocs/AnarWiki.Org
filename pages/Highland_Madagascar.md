In 1989, the anthropologist David Graeber visited and studied
Arivonimamo, a town of 10,000 people in the Madagascar highlands.
Graeber reports that as a result of cutbacks mandated by 1980s
IMF-ordered austerity policies, the state had a very minimal presence in
the town and the surrounding rural region of Imerina.[^1] It “was
considered wrong for adults to be giving one another orders”.[^2]

## Culture

Religious beliefs helped maintain solidarity and prevent inequality and
crime:

> “Society was overall remarkably peaceable. Yet once again it was
> surrounded by invisible warfare; just about everyone had access to
> dangerous medicine or spirits or was willing to let on they might; the
> night was haunted by witches who danced naked on tombs and rode men
> like horses; just about all sickness was due to envy, hatred, and
> magical attack. What’s more, witchcraft bore a strange, ambivalent
> relation to national identity. While people made rhetorical reference
> to Malagasy as equal and united “like hairs on a head,” ideals of
> economic equality were rarely, if ever, invoked; however, it was
> assumed that anyone who became too rich or powerful would be destroyed
> by witchcraft, and while witchcraft was the definition of evil, it was
> also seen as peculiarly Malagasy (charms were just charms but evil
> charms were called “Malagasy charms”). Insofar as rituals of moral
> solidarity did occur, and the ideal of equality was invoked, it was
> largely in the course of rituals held to suppress, expel, or destroy
> those witches who, perversely, were the twisted embodiment and
> practical enforcement of the egalitarian ethos of the society
> itself.”[^3]

The highlands' cultures are “not entirely egalitarian: there
are...certain key forms of dominance, at least of men over women, elders
over juniors.”[^4]

## Decisions

People met at assemblies called *fokon'olona*, where they made decisions
by consensus. Anyone could block a decision by making a *tsy manaiky
aho*, meaning “I am no longer in agreement”.[^5]

## Economy

According to Graeber, the market only existed “in theory,” and wage
labor was viewed as “morally suspect”.[^6] Graeber writes, “I don't want
to romanticize the situation. What autonomy rural communities have has
been won at the cost of grinding poverty.” Almost all the kids attend
state schools, which Graeber accuses of trying to indoctrinate the kids:
“The style of teaching was entirely authoritarian, with a heavy emphasis
on rote memorization, and the skills that were taught were taught with
the expectation that they were to be employed in offices, workshops, or
classrooms organized” hierarchially.[^7]

## Environment

## Crime

There was no police station in Arivonimamo.[^8] The closest thing to a
police force “was a unit of gendarmes who had barracks somewhat to the
west of town. Mainly, they patrolled the highways.”[^9] In Arivonimamo,
there was a man named Henri who terrorized women and stole from shops.
The town decided to get together and kill him, and received permission
from Henri's father. So, the next time Henri provoked a fight, a crowd
appeared and tried to kill him. Henri escaped but did not return for
many years.

“The most significant thing about violence around Arivonimamo was that
there was very little of it. Murders were shocking, isolated events;
there were very few Henris.”[^10]
