> Each ecovillage is a little different, but a few examples can provide
> an idea of their diversity. The Farm, in rural Tennessee, has 350
> residents. Established in 1971, it contains mulch gardens,
> solar-heated showers, a sustainable shiitake mushroom business, straw
> bale houses, and a center for training people from around the world to
> build their own ecovillages. Old Bassaisa, in Egypt, contains a few
> hundred residents and has existed for thousands of years. The
> residents have perfected an ecological and sustainable village design
> from traditional methods. Old Bassaisa now contains a Future Studies
> center, and they are developing new sustainable technologies like a
> methane gas producing unit that extracts gases from cow manure to save
> themselves from having to use scarce firewood. They use the leftover
> slurry as fertilizer for their fields. Ecotop, near Dusseldorf in
> Germany, is an entire suburb with hundreds of residents living in
> several four-story apartment buildings and a few detached homes. The
> architecture fosters a sense of community and freedom, with a number
> of communal and private spaces. Between the buildings, in a sort of
> village center, is a multi-use courtyard/playground /pedestrian zone,
> as well as community gardens and an abundance of plants and trees. The
> buildings, which have a completely modern, urban aesthetic, were
> constructed with natural materials and designed with passive heating
> and cooling and biological on-site wastewater treatment.

> Earthhaven, with about 60 residents, was founded in 1995 in North
> Carolina by permaculture designers. It is composed of several
> neighborhood clusters set in the steep Appalachian hills. Most of the
> land is covered in forest, but the residents recently made the
> difficult decision to clear some of the forest for gardens so they
> could come closer to food self-sufficiency rather than exporting the
> costs of their lifestyle by purchasing food from elsewhere. They
> talked about it a long time, prepared themselves spiritually, and
> attempted to clear the land in a respectful way. This sort of
> attitude, which capitalist ideology would dismiss as sentimental and
> inefficient, is exactly what could prevent destruction of the
> environment in an anarchist society.
