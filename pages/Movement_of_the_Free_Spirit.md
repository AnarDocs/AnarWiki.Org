The Movement of the Free Spirit was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century
Christian heresy that spread across an area from present day Czech
Republic to France. Involving a disproportionate number of women, they
avoided work and have been compared to twentieth-century hippies. In an
unsympathetic portrayal that would inadvertently capture the imagination
of Anarchists and libertarian Marxists, the conservative historian
Norman Cohn denounced the Free Spirits as “reckless” followers of “a
quasi-mystical anarchism” and “precursors of Bakunin”: “a quasi-mystical
anarchism—an affirmation of freedom so reckless and unqualified that it
amounted to a total denial of every kind of restraint and limitation.
These people could be regarded as remote precursors of Bakunin and
Nietzsche—or rather of that bohemian intelligentsia which during the
last half-century has been living from ideas once expressed by Bakunin
and Nietzsche in their wilder moments.”[^1]

Free Spirits believed they had attained a state of perfection where each
member believed “that he was incapable of sin.” *The Mirror of Simple
Souls*, written by the Free Spirit mystic Marguerite Porete, explains:

> "\[Free Spirits\] do nothing but what pleases them; or if they do,
> they deprive themselves of peace, freedom and nobility. For the soul
> is not perfected until it does what it pleases, and is not reproached
> for taking its pleasure."

They practiced antinomianism, voluntary poverty, and allegedly assigned
an emancipatory value to eroticism, “which incidentally is the value
which ‘free love’ has often possessed in our own times,” Cohn noted in
the 1960s. Women “played a large part” in the heresy, and many of these
women belonged to a movement of beatas called the Beguines (their
masculine counterpart was called the Beghards).[^2] Raoul Vaneigem, a
former member of the
"<a   href="Situationist_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationist International">"Situationist International</a>
celebrates the Free Spirits as people who “renounced all spiritual and
temporal authority, seeking no more than to live in accordance with
their own desires.”[^3]

Cohn describes the Free Spirits' metaphysical beliefs:

> "The metaphysical framework was provided by Neo-Platonism; but all the
> efforts which had been made, from Pseudo-Dionysius and Erigena
> onwards, to adapt Neo-Platonism to Christian beliefs were discounted.
> The pantheism of Plotinus, so far from being slurred over, was
> emphasized. The Brethren of the Free Spirit did not hesitate to say:
> ‘God is all that is’, ‘God is in every stone and in each limb of the
> human body as surely as in the Eucharistic bread’, ‘Every created
> thing is divine.’ At the same time they took over Plotinus’ own
> interpretation of this pantheism. It was the eternal essence of
> things, not their existence in time, that was truly God; whatever had
> a separate, transitory existence had emanated from God, but no longer
> was God. On the other hand whatever existed was bound to yearn for its
> Divine Origin and to strive to find its way back into that Origin; and
> at the end of time everything would in fact be reabsorbed into God. No
> emanation would remain, nothing would exist in separateness, there
> would no longer be anything capable of knowing, wishing, acting. All
> that would be left would be one single Essence, changeless, inactive:
> one all-embracing ‘Blessedness’. Even the Persons of the Trinity, the
> Brethren of the Free Spirit insisted, would be submerged in that
> undifferentiated One. At the end of time, God really would be
> all."[^4]

The Free Spirits emerged in Paris around 1200. They were quickly
arrested by Church officials, and those who did not recant were burnt to
death. However, the heresy was soon elaborated into a “mystical
pantheism” by the University of Paris theologian Amaury.[^5]

Later manifestations included currents in Swabia and within the
Franciscans of Umbria. Important writings influenced by the Movement of
the Free Spirits include Portete’s *Mirror of the simple souls* and
works of John Hartmann. Portete, who was burned at the stake on 1 June
1310 for spreading her beliefs, described an existence where one is so
immersed in love that she is incapable of sinning and is therefore freed
from the fear of sin. Portete compared this permanent condition to the
temporary bliss of a drunken man: “This soul, in this state, is like the
drunken man. For the drunken man never cares what may befall him,
whatever it may chance to be, any more than if it were nothing; and if
he does care, then he is not truly drunk.” Vaneigem contrasts Porete’s
reverence for nonhuman nature with the Church’s attitudes: “Whereas the
Church was hostile to nature, Margaret proposed that it might be
rehabilitated to its state before the Fall , before the appearance of
sin and the invention of exchange. Access to it lies in the refinement
of love, in an identification with the power it generates in
everyone.”[^6] Hartmann also elaborated on the condition of perfection
and free from sin: “Those who are in this degree of perfection and in
the freedom of spirit are no longer obliged to obey men, or any precept,
or the rules of the Church: they are truly free.”[^7]

Robert Lerner, a 1960s campus radical captivated by Norman Cohn’s *The
Pursuit of the Millennium*, looked in the primary sources for more
information on a supposed movement of proletarian social
revolutionaries. The further he researched, the more he found his
assumptions unfounded, as he explained in an important 1972 study *The
Heresy of the Free Spirit*:

> \[M\]y search for an organized sect comprised of lower-class Bakunins
> seemed like a continual shearing away at a shaggy dog that turned out
> to be nothing but shag. Faced with such diminishing returns I had no
> choice but to abandon my previous assumptions and develop a new
> interpretation which I now believe fully justified by the sources and
> which I will defend with the conviction of a convert.[^8]

Lerner responded to Cohn as well as to other recent studies that largely
recapitulated Cohn’s conclusions. Lerner insists that the Free Spirit
movement “was far more typical of the late medieval search for God than
has commonly been imposed,” and “it was not a revolutionary force.”[^9]

However, some of Lerner’s own admissions suggest that the Free Spirit
movement posed serious challenges to the patriarchy and hierarchy of the
Church. Lerner points out, “\[O\]ne of the few generalizations that can
be made without hesitancy is that a disproportionate number of the
heretics were women.”[^10] Moreover, they practiced (as Cohn would abhor
and Vaneigem would celebrate) a certain anti-work “idleness” that leads
Lerner to compare them with twentieth-century hippies: "Free Spirits,
like the hippies, hoped to quicken the life of the ‘interior’ rather
than the ‘exterior’ man and while some went preaching, others were
sedentary and might have been entirely passive.” Most importantly, the
Free Spirits criticized and often outright rejected Church hierarchy and
the sacraments, as Lerner notes: “Over and over again Free Spirits
argued for a direct relationship to God without sacramental mediation
and insisted on their superiority to priests.”[^11] Centuries before
Luther, such challenges to ecclesiastical authority and sacraments well
exceeded what the friar would eventually propose. The Free Spirits might
not have been “revolutionary” in the modern sense, but it is hard to see
them as anything but subversive.

# Connections with later heresies

The Free Spirits preceded and may have influenced later heresies
including the fifteenth-century Bohemian Adamites (a radical offshoot of
the "<a   href="Taborite_communes.md" class="wikilink"
title="Taborite communes">"Taborite communes</a>, who are themselves a
radical offshoot of the Hussite movement) and the alumbrados of Spain.
Cohn argues, “\[T\]he Free Spirit flourished at various times both in
Italy and in Spain \[…\] similar doctrines \[to Marguerite Porete’s and
other Free Spirits’\] were flourishing in Spain, amongst the mystics
known as the Alumbrados.[^12] Alistair Hamilton writes that the Free
Spirits, thriving in late medieval German lands, “could have entered
Spain” through the Order of St. Francis and influenced the
alumbrados.[^13]
