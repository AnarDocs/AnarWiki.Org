Palestinians launched the Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) movement on
9 July 2005 in order to pressure Israel to respect human rights and
international law. The decentralized movement, inclusive of many
anti-authoritarian groups and individuals, has gained massive global
grassroots support and has been labelled an "existential threat" and
"strategic threat" by prominent Israeli sources. To get involved, visit

# Origins

The 2005 call included over 170 organizational endorsements that
included, according to co-founder Omar Barghouti, all of Palestinians'
"major political parties, refugee rights associations, trade union
federations, women’s unions, NGO networks, and virtually the entire
spectrum of grassroots organizations."[^1]

The BDS movement is inspired by South Africa's anti-apartheid movement
and decades of Palestinian resistance[^2] such as the largely
anti-authoritarian

Intifada</a>.

# Demands and Ideology

The 2005 platform makes three demands of Israel:

> 1\. Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and
> dismantling the Wall 2. Recognizing the fundamental rights of the
> Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and 3.
> Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian
> refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN
> resolution 194.[^3]

The Boycott National Committee (BNC) has since specified that the first
demand refers only to lands occupied since Israel's 1967 conquests, and
many of the original signatories support a two-state solution.[^4]
Nonetheless, many participants say that fulfilling the three demands
requires establishing a binational or secular democratic Palestine
through a one-state or zero-state outcome.[^5]

# Structure

The Boycott National Committee (BNC), comprised of Palestinians,
describes the BDS movement as being "decentralized." Any group of people
can use the BDS acronym as long as they agree to the 2005 platform and
principles of anti-racism and nonviolence. When a group using the BDS
label does not adhere to these principle, the BNC might ask them to stop
using the BDS name.[^6]

The movement consists largely of anarchistic affinity groups and
networks. For example, U.S.-based Palestinian writer Steven Salaita
describes the USA-Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI) as anarchistic:

> If anything, the organization abides by certain tenets of anarchism in
> that it eschews top-down authority and has no officers. While it has
> informal arrangements of power and members with different levels of
> influence, no constitutional hierarchy exists. We reach decisions
> through consensus, defined in our case by a preponderance of agreement
> with no vocalized opposition. If a member disapproves of a proposed
> action, If a member disapproves of a proposed action, discussion
> ensues; if the dissenting member does not stand down from his or her
> disapproval, then the conversation continues. Without an adequate
> resolution, the action stalls, unless the dissenter approves of its
> adoption while maintaining his or her disagreement. Student members of
> the organizing committee (OC) have the same formal power as senior
> professors.[^7]

# Impact

In 2010, the Reut Institute, an Israeli Zionist think tank, called the
deligitmation of Israel an "existential threat" and singled out BDS.[^8]
In 2015, Israel's president called BDS a "strategic threat."[^9] The BDS
website lists the following victories:

> - BDS was a major factor behind the 46% drop in foreign direct
>   investment in Israel in 2014, according to a UN report. A Rand
>   Corporation study predicts BDS could reduce Israel’s GDP “by 1 to 2
>   percent” annually over the next 10 years, while a World Bank report
>   reveals that Israel’s exports to the Palestinian economy have
>   dropped by 24% in the first quarter of 2015.
> - French multinational Veolia has completely withdrawn from Israel
>   after a BDS campaign over its role in Israel’s colonisation of
>   Palestinian land cost it billions of dollars in lost contracts.
> - Top Israeli weapons manufacturers complain of a plummeting exports
>   “crisis,” partly due to “less desire for Israeli-made products.”
> - Major international companies including Orange, G4S and Unilever
>   have announced steps to end their participation in Israel’s crimes.
> - Thousands of artists including Roger Waters from Pink Floyd,
>   Faithless, Lauryn Hill, Brian Eno and Elvis Costello have refused to
>   play in Israel.
> - Academic associations and student unions, most notably in the US,
>   Canada, South Africa and the UK, now support BDS. A number of
>   churches have divested from companies involved in Israel’s
>   occupation.
> - Israel regards BDS as a “strategic threat” to its ongoing oppression
>   of Palestinians. Some Israelis are calling for modest changes to
>   Israeli policy.[^10]

# Anarchists and BDS

Anarchist and anti-authoritarian supporters of BDS include the Black
Rose / Rosa Negra Anarchist Federation[^11],
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a>[^12], and Anarchists Against the Wall.[^13]
<a href="Black_Lives_Matter" class="wikilink"
title="Black Lives Matter">Black Lives Matter</a>, a U.S. movement
organized along highly decentralized and anarchistic lines, supports
BDS.[^14] Although the Anarchist intellectual Noam Chomsky has famously
criticized BDS, alleging that its demands are impractical in the
near-term, he clarified in a 2017 statement that he supports the
movement.[^15] Palestinian Anarchists, like the Palestinian movement
more generally, appear to support BDS.[^16]
