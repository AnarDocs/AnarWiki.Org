### Notes

- This section was developed because of white settlers (or descendants
  of settlers) with vulgar Marxist education are ignorant about theories
  and dismisses personal experiences of people who donâ€™t fit into their
  Euro-centric strata
- A more industrialised version of the USA would just kill the planet at
  the expense of the Global South
- A USSR version of Canada still would not address the exploitation of
  the Global South
- World already produces enough food for everyone, and most places can
  feed themselves. Reason for global hunger is because of capitalists in
  North America and Europe creating artificial scarcity and half is
  thrown away. Data shows Global North forces many countries in the
  Global South to over-export their agricultural production while very
  little food supplies remain to feed local populations. For some
  reason, a few Marxist-Leninists think we need to produce even more
  food under capitalism while maintaining the current wasteful bourgeois
  lifestyle instead of redistribution and communization *slash*
  communalism.
- Massive amounts of land goes towards livestock production and
  replacing concentrated animal feeding operations and industrial
  agriculture with decentralized economies (eg. high-yield agroforestry,
  permaculture, pastoral nomadism) or alternatives with lower carbon
  uptakes and lower water usage (eg. plant-based diets, subsistence
  hunting and fishing) would dramatically reduce our ecological
  footprint.
- Plant-based meats are the most efficient, considerably less resources.
  A recent independent life cycle analysis of the Impossible Burger
  found that it used considerably less resources (I assume this is true
  for all plant-based meat)
- Cell-based meat uses more resources than plant-based meat but is still
  significantly better than commercial livestock, especially in terms of
  industrial land usage.

<!-- -->

- If someone calls themself Marxist confuses â€œoverproductionâ€ for
  â€œoverconsumptionâ€, they never read Karl Marxâ€™s â€œTheories of Surplus
  Valueâ€ nor â€œCapitalâ€. He writes about how capitalism over-produces as
  well as discusses and outlines the issues with producing more than
