# Anarcho-Primitivism

## Overview

**Anarcho-primitivism** is an
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
critique of "<a   href="civilization.md" class="wikilink"
title="civilization">"civilization</a> that advocates a return to
non-civilized ways of life through
"<a   href="deindustrialization.md" class="wikilink"
title="deindustrialization">"deindustrialization</a>, abolition of the
division of labor or specialization, abandonment of large-scale
organization and all
"<a   href="technology.md" class="wikilink" title="technology">"technology</a>
other than prehistoric technology, and the dissolution of
"<a   href="agriculture.md" class="wikilink"
title="agriculture">"agriculture</a>.

Anarcho-primitivists critique the origins and alleged progress of the
"<a   href="Industrial_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Revolution">"Industrial Revolution</a> and
"<a   href="industrial_society.md" class="wikilink"
title="industrial society">"industrial society</a>.[^1] Most
anarcho-primitivists advocate for a tribal-like way of life while some
see an even simpler lifestyle as beneficial. According to
anarcho-primitivists, the shift from
"<a   href="hunter-gatherer.md" class="wikilink"
title="hunter-gatherer">"hunter-gatherer</a> to agricultural subsistence
during the "<a   href="Neolithic_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Neolithic Revolution">"Neolithic Revolution</a> gave rise to
"<a   href="coercion.md" class="wikilink" title="coercion">"coercion</a>,
"<a   href="social_alienation.md" class="wikilink"
title="social alienation">"social alienation</a>, and
"<a   href="social_stratification.md" class="wikilink"
title="social stratification">"social stratification</a>.[^2]

Anarcho-primitivism argues that civilization is at the root of societal
and environmental problems.[^3] Primitivists also consider
domestication, technology and language to cause social alienation from
"authentic reality". As a result, they propose the abolition of
civilization and a return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.[^4]

## Origins

The roots of primitivism lay in Enlightenment philosophy and the
critical theory of the "<a   href="Frankfurt_School.md" class="wikilink"
title="Frankfurt School">"Frankfurt School</a>.[^5] The early-modern
philosopher "<a   href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">"Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> blamed
"<a   href="agriculture.md" class="wikilink"
title="agriculture">"agriculture</a> and cooperation for the development
of "<a   href="social_inequality.md" class="wikilink"
title="social inequality">"social inequality</a> and causing habitat
destruction. In his *Discourse on Inequality*, Rousseau depicted the
state of nature as a "primitivist utopia";[^6] however, he stopped short
of advocating a return to it.[^7]

Instead, Rousseau called for political institutions to be recreated
anew, in harmony with nature and without the artificiality of modern
civilization.[^8] Later, critical theorist
"<a   href="Max_Horkheimer.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Horkheimer">"Max
Horkheimer</a> argued that environmental degradation stemmed directly
from "<a   href="social_oppression.md" class="wikilink"
title="social oppression">"social oppression</a>, which had vested all
value in labor and consequently caused widespread alienation.[^9]

## Tendencies

### Zerzan and the Modern Movement

The modern school of anarcho-primitivism was primarily developed by
"<a   href="John_Zerzan.md" class="wikilink" title="John Zerzan">"John
Zerzan</a>,[^10] whose work was released at a time when
"<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchist">"green
anarchist</a> theories of social ecology and deep ecology were beginning
to attract interest. Primitivism, as outlined in Zerzan's work, first
gained popularity as enthusiasm in deep ecology began to wane.[^11]

Zerzan claimed that pre-civilization societies were inherently superior
to modern civilization and that the move towards agriculture and the
increasing use of technology had resulted in the alienation and
oppression of humankind.[^12] Zerzan argued that under civilization,
humans and other species have undergone domestication, which stripped
them of their agency and subjected them to control by
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>.

He also claimed that
"<a   href="language.md" class="wikilink" title="language">"language</a>,
"<a   href="mathematics.md" class="wikilink"
title="mathematics">"mathematics</a> and
"<a   href="art.md" class="wikilink" title="art">"art</a> had caused
alienation, as they replaced "authentic reality" with an abstracted
representation of reality.[^13] In order to counteract such issues,
Zerzan proposed that humanity return to a state of nature, which he
believed would increase "<a   href="social_equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="social equality">"social equality</a> and individual autonomy by
abolishing "<a   href="private_property.md" class="wikilink"
title="private property">"private property</a>, organized violence and
the division of labor.[^14]

### Alternative Perspectives

Primitivist thinker
"<a   href="Paul_Shepard.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Shepard">"Paul
Shepard</a> also criticized domestication, which he believed had
devalued non-human life and reduced human life to their labor and
property. Other primitivist authors have drawn different conclusions to
Zerzan on the origins of alienation, with John Fillis blaming
"<a   href="technology.md" class="wikilink" title="technology">"technology</a>
and Richard Heinberg claiming it to be a result of addiction
psychology.[^15]

### Rewilding and Practice

Primitivists and green anarchists have adopted the concept of ecological
"<a   href="rewilding.md" class="wikilink" title="rewilding">"rewilding</a> as
part of their practice, using reclaimed skills and methods to work
towards a sustainable future while undoing institutions of
civilization.[^16]

### Publications and Media

Anarcho-primitivist periodicals include *Green Anarchy* and *Species
Traitor*. The former, self-described as an "anti-civilization journal of
theory and action" and printed in
"<a   href="Eugene,_Oregon.md" class="wikilink" title="Eugene, Oregon">"Eugene,
Oregon</a>, was first published in 2000 and expanded from a 16-page
newsprint tabloid to a 76-page magazine covering monkeywrenching topics
such as pipeline sabotage and animal liberation.

*Species Traitor*, edited by Kevin Tucker, is self-described as "an
insurrectionary anarcho-primitivist journal", with essays against
literacy and for hunter gatherer societies. Adjacent periodicals include
the radical environmental journal *Earth First!*[^17]

## Criticism

### Violence and Terrorism

Primitivist ideas were taken up by
"<a   href="Ted_Kaczynski.md" class="wikilink" title="Ted Kaczynski">"Ted
Kaczynski</a>, although he has been repeatedly criticized for his
violent means by more pacifistic anarcho-primitivists, who instead
advocate for non-violent forms of
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a>.[^18] This association with violence has led to significant
criticism of the movement, particularly following Kaczynski's bombing
campaign.

### Relationship with Other Movements

Primitivist concepts have also taken root within the philosophy of
"<a   href="deep_ecology.md" class="wikilink" title="deep ecology">"deep
ecology</a>, inspiring the direct actions of groups such as
"<a   href="Earth_First!.md" class="wikilink" title="Earth First!">"Earth
First!</a>.[^19] Another radical environmentalist group, the
"<a   href="Earth_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">"Earth Liberation Front</a> (ELF), was
directly influenced by anarcho-primitivism and its calls for
rewilding.[^20]
