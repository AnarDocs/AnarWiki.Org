# Marxism-Leninism

## Overview

**Marxism-Leninism** is a
pro-"<a   href="Communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communist">"communist</a>
ideology that became the dominant form of state socialism in the 20th
century. Despite its name suggesting continuity with
"<a   href="Karl_Marx.md" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">"Karl Marx</a> and
"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">"Vladimir Lenin</a>, Marxism-Leninism was codified
as a distinct ideology by
"<a   href="Joseph_Stalin.md" class="wikilink" title="Joseph Stalin">"Joseph
Stalin</a> after Lenin's death in 1924.[^1][^2] The ideology advocates
for a "<a   href="Dictatorship_of_the_Proletariat.md" class="wikilink"
title="dictatorship of the proletariat">"dictatorship of the
proletariat</a> led by a
"<a   href="Vanguardism.md" class="wikilink" title="vanguard party">"vanguard

From an
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
perspective, Marxism-Leninism represents a fundamental betrayal of
socialist principles, replacing "<a   href="Hierarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical">"hierarchical</a> capitalist structures with new
forms of "<a   href="Authority.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">"authoritarian</a> domination under party
bureaucrats. While claiming to work toward a stateless, classless
society, Marxist-Leninist systems have historically reproduced the very
hierarchies they claimed to oppose.

## Origins

### Stalin's Codification

The term "Marxism-Leninism" was created by Stalin as a
"<a   href="Political_ideology.md" class="wikilink"
title="political doctrine">"political doctrine</a> to legitimize his rule
and present himself as Lenin's sole authentic interpreter.[^3] Lenin
himself never used this term, referring to his approach as
""<a   href="Bolshevism.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolshevism">"Bolshevism</a>."
Stalin's 1938 work *Dialectical and Historical Materialism* codified
"<a   href="Marxist_philosophy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist philosophy">"Marxist philosophy</a> into rigid orthodoxy
and established "Marxism-Leninism" as the official
"<a   href="State_ideology.md" class="wikilink" title="state ideology">"state
ideology</a> of the
"<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">"Soviet
Union</a>.[^4]

Stalin added several innovations to Lenin's theories:

- **"<a   href="Socialism_in_One_Country.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Socialism in One Country">"Socialism in One Country</a>**: The
  doctrine that the USSR could build socialism without international
  revolution, contradicting Lenin and
  "<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">"Leon
  Trotsky</a>'s belief in the necessity of world revolution[^5]
- **Bureaucratic Centralization**: Extreme concentration of power that
  eliminated remaining party democracy
- **Cult of Leadership**: Systematized personal dictatorship far beyond
  Lenin's authoritarianism
- **Dialectical Materialism as Catechism**: Transformation of Marxist
  analysis into inflexible dogma

### Continuity or Break from Leninism?

Whether Marxism-Leninism represents continuity with or betrayal of
Lenin's vision remains contested:

"<a   href="Trotskyism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Trotskyists">"Trotskyists</a> argue Stalin betrayed Lenin's
vision, pointing to Lenin's final writings warning against Stalin's
power accumulation and suggesting his removal as General Secretary.[^6]
They contend Lenin's "<a   href="Democratic_Centralism.md" class="wikilink"
title="democratic centralism">"democratic centralism</a> was meant for
collective leadership, and his authoritarianism was temporary response
to "<a   href="Russian_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink" title="civil war">"civil
war</a> conditions.

Anarchists argue Stalin represented the logical conclusion of Leninist
methods. Once you accept "<a   href="Vanguardism.md" class="wikilink"
title="vanguardism">"vanguardism</a>, hierarchical party structures, and
state power as revolutionary tools, someone will inevitably use those
tools for personal domination. The institutional framework Stalin
inherited—the ban on party factions (1921), the
"<a   href="Cheka.md" class="wikilink" title="secret police">"secret police</a>,
suppression of "<a   href="Workers&#39;_Council.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">"workers' councils</a>, and party
dictatorship—were Lenin's creations that enabled Stalin's rise.

"<a   href="Left_Communism.md" class="wikilink" title="Left communists">"Left
communists</a> and "<a   href="Council_Communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="council communists">"council communists</a> identified these
dangers during Lenin's lifetime, criticizing the suppression of workers'
councils, the "<a   href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt massacre">"Kronstadt massacre</a> (1921), and
elimination of party democracy as betrayals of revolutionary principles.

### Differences from Classical Marxism

Marxism-Leninism diverges significantly from Marx's original analysis:

**The Vanguard Party**: Marx envisioned the
"<a   href="Working_Class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">"working
class</a> developing revolutionary consciousness through their
experience of
"<a   href="Capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>.
Lenin added the concept of a disciplined vanguard party of professional
revolutionaries, arguing workers would only develop "trade union
consciousness" without party leadership. This fundamentally altered the
relationship between revolutionary theory and working-class
self-organization.

**The State**: While Marx suggested the state would "wither away" after
revolution, Lenin emphasized the need to smash the bourgeois state and
build a "dictatorship of the proletariat"—which in practice meant party
rule—as an extended transition period. This became one of the most
consequential differences, as the "temporary" party dictatorship became
permanent in every Marxist-Leninist state.

**Revolutionary Strategy**: Marx saw revolution emerging from workers'
self-organization and
"<a   href="Class_Struggle.md" class="wikilink" title="class struggle">"class
struggle</a>. Lenin emphasized the need for a highly centralized party
to seize state power through insurrection, often prioritizing party
organization over mass working-class movement.

## Shared Ground with Marxism

Marxism-Leninism inherits significant analytical frameworks from
classical
"<a   href="Marxism.md" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">"Marxism</a>, though
anarchists critique both traditions for their approach to authority and
the state. The shared elements include:

- **"<a   href="Historical_Materialism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Historical Materialism">"Historical Materialism</a>**:
  Understanding that material conditions and economic relations shape
  social structures
- **"<a   href="Class_Struggle.md" class="wikilink" title="Class Struggle">"Class
  Struggle</a>**: Recognition that conflict between exploiters and
  exploited drives historical change
- **"<a   href="Anti-Capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Anti-Capitalism">"Anti-Capitalism</a>**: Critique of
  "<a   href="Surplus_Value.md" class="wikilink"
  title="surplus value extraction">"surplus value extraction</a>,
  "<a   href="Wage_Labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">"wage labor</a>,
  and "<a   href="Private_Property.md" class="wikilink"
  title="private property">"private property</a> in the means of
  production
- **Goal of
  "<a   href="Communism.md" class="wikilink" title="Communism">"Communism</a>**:
  Nominal commitment to a "<a   href="Classless_Society.md" class="wikilink"
  title="classless">"classless</a>,
  "<a   href="Stateless_Society.md" class="wikilink"
  title="stateless">"stateless</a> society based on ""<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs.md"
  class="wikilink"
  title="from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs">"from
  each according to their ability, to each according to their needs</a>"
- **"<a   href="Proletarian_Internationalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Internationalism">"Internationalism</a>**: Solidarity of the
  "<a   href="Working_Class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">"working
  class</a> across national boundaries
- **Opposition to
  "<a   href="Reformism.md" class="wikilink" title="Reformism">"Reformism</a>**:
  Rejection of gradual transformation through
  "<a   href="Electoral_Politics.md" class="wikilink"
  title="electoral politics">"electoral politics</a>

However, anarchists argue Marxism-Leninism betrayed Marx's emancipatory
vision by substituting party dictatorship for working-class
self-emancipation. While Marx wrote in the Provisional Rules of the
First International that "the emancipation of the working classes must
be conquered by the working classes themselves,"[^7] Marxism-Leninism
installed vanguard party rule. The shared analytical tools diverged
fundamentally in practice: state ownership replaced social ownership,
and hierarchical organization replaced the self-activity of the
oppressed.

## Core Tenets

Marxism-Leninism is organized around several key principles:

- **Vanguard Party**: A centralized, disciplined party of professional
  revolutionaries to lead the working class
- **Democratic Centralism**: Organizational principle requiring public
  unity after internal debate, concentrating decision-making power at
  the top
- **Dictatorship of the Proletariat**: Party rule to suppress the
  bourgeoisie and build socialism
- **State Ownership**: Centralized state control of the
  "<a   href="Means_of_Production.md" class="wikilink"
  title="means of production">"means of production</a> through
  "<a   href="Economic_Planning.md" class="wikilink"
  title="economic planning">"economic planning</a>
- **Suppression of Opposition**: Elimination of rival political parties
  and tendencies as "counter-revolutionary"

## Anarchist Critique

The anarchist critique of Marxism-Leninism addresses fundamental
questions of authority, organization, and the relationship between means
and ends.

### Authority and Hierarchy

Marxist-Leninists believe a "dictatorship of the proletariat" is
necessary to suppress the "<a   href="Bourgeoisie.md" class="wikilink"
title="bourgeoisie">"bourgeoisie</a> and transition to communism. In
practice, this has always meant party rule, not working-class rule.
Anarchists argue that "<a   href="Hierarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="hierarchical authority">"hierarchical authority</a> cannot be a
tool for liberation—that you cannot use the master's tools to dismantle
the master's house.

Every Marxist-Leninist revolution has resulted in a new ruling class of
party bureaucrats rather than the promised stateless society. The
hierarchical structures created to "temporarily" wield power become
permanent, as those who hold power develop material interests in
maintaining it. Power does not voluntarily dissolve itself.

### The State

The fundamental disagreement centers on the state itself.
Marxist-Leninists seek to capture
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state power">"state
power</a> and use it as an instrument of working-class rule. Anarchists
seek to abolish the state entirely, viewing it as inherently oppressive
regardless of who controls it.

The historical pattern is clear: every Marxist-Leninist state has
maintained and intensified hierarchical relations. The state did not
"wither away"—instead, it expanded into every aspect of social life.
"<a   href="State_Capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="State ownership">"State ownership</a> of the means of production
simply replaced private capitalists with party bureaucrats, maintaining
"<a   href="Wage_Labor.md" class="wikilink" title="wage labor">"wage labor</a>,
hierarchical management, and "<a   href="Exploitation.md" class="wikilink"
title="exploitation">"exploitation</a> under new management.

### Revolutionary Strategy

Marxist-Leninists emphasize seizing state power through a vanguard
party, then using that power to transform society from above. This
"revolution from above" reproduces authoritarian relations in the name
of liberation.

Anarchists advocate building alternative structures that
"<a   href="Prefigurative_Politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigure">"prefigure</a> the free society:
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid networks">"mutual
aid networks</a>, "<a   href="Cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="cooperatives">"cooperatives</a>,
"<a   href="Commune_(intentional_community).md" class="wikilink"
title="communes">"communes</a>, and
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Council.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">"workers' councils</a>. These directly
democratic, horizontal structures attack
"<a   href="Hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">"hierarchy</a>
wherever it exists rather than concentrating power. The revolution must
be the creative act of the oppressed themselves, not something delivered
to them by a vanguard party.

### Organization

Democratic centralism concentrates decision-making power at the top of
hierarchical party structures. While internal debate is theoretically
allowed, discipline and "unity of action" require public support for
decisions made by leadership. In practice, this has consistently led to
suppression of dissent and factional purges.

Anarchists favor
"<a   href="Federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">"federalism</a>
and "<a   href="Direct_Democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a>—horizontal networks where
decisions flow from the base up, with instant recall of delegates who
have no independent decision-making power. Representatives in anarchist
organization are mandated delegates, not leaders, and can be immediately
replaced if they fail to carry out the will of those who delegated them.

### Means and Ends

Perhaps the deepest philosophical split concerns the relationship
between means and ends. Marxist-Leninists argue the ends justify the
means—temporary authoritarianism for eventual freedom, concentrated
power for eventual "<a   href="Stateless_Society.md" class="wikilink"
title="statelessness">"statelessness</a>.

Anarchists insist the means must embody the ends. You create freedom
through freedom, not through domination. Authoritarian means produce
authoritarian ends. The methods of organization you use during the
revolution shape the society that emerges from it. A hierarchical party
seizing state power cannot produce a non-hierarchical, stateless
society.

This isn't abstract philosophy but historical observation: not one
Marxist-Leninist state has progressed toward statelessness. Instead,
they have entrenched new forms of hierarchy and exploitation.

### Economic Organization

Both anarchists and Marxist-Leninists oppose
"<a   href="Capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>,
but their alternatives differ fundamentally. Marxist-Leninists
historically implemented centralized state planning with top-down
control of production and distribution.

Anarchists favor decentralized coordination through federations of
worker-controlled enterprises. Rather than state planning, anarchists
advocate for "<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">"workers' self-management</a>,
"<a   href="Gift_Economy.md" class="wikilink" title="gift economies">"gift
economies</a>, and
"<a   href="Mutual_Aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
networks coordinated horizontally between freely associating producers.
Economic decisions are made by those directly affected, not by party
planners or state bureaucrats.

## Historical Record

The historical record of Marxism-Leninism demonstrates the anarchist
critique in practice.

### Betrayal of the Russian Revolution

The
"<a   href="Bolsheviks.md" class="wikilink" title="Bolsheviks">"Bolsheviks</a>
systematically destroyed the genuine organs of working-class power that
emerged during the "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">"Russian Revolution</a>:

- **"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Council.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Workers&#39; Councils">"Workers' Councils</a> (Soviets)**: The
  Bolsheviks subordinated the soviets to party control, transforming
  them from organs of working-class self-government into transmission
  belts for party directives
- **"<a   href="Kronstadt_Rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Kronstadt Rebellion">"Kronstadt Rebellion</a>** (1921):
  Bolshevik forces massacred revolutionary sailors and workers demanding
  "Soviets without Bolsheviks" and genuine working-class

- **"<a   href="Revolutionary_Insurgent_Army_of_Ukraine.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Makhnovshchina">"Makhnovshchina</a>**: The Bolsheviks betrayed
  and destroyed the anarchist

  successfully implemented libertarian communism and defended the
  revolution against White armies[^11][^12]
- **Factory Committees**: Worker-controlled factory committees were
  replaced with one-man management and state control

### Suppression of Anarchists

Every Marxist-Leninist state has imprisoned, exiled, and executed
anarchists:

- The USSR

  title="imprisoned thousands of anarchists">"imprisoned thousands of

  "<a   href="Cuba.md" class="wikilink" title="Cuba">"Cuba</a>, and every other
  Marxist-Leninist state has banned anarchist organization and
  imprisoned anarchists

### Failure Rate

Of the numerous Marxist-Leninist revolutions in the 20th century,
approximately 90% have failed to achieve even their stated goals, let
alone create communism:

- Most "<a   href="Marxist_Leninist_States.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Leninist states">"Leninist states</a> have collapsed or
  transformed into market capitalist systems
- None have progressed toward the "withering away of the state"
- "<a   href="Living_standards.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Living standards">"Living standards</a> in many post-Soviet
  states declined dramatically after the introduction of market reforms,
  but living standards under Marxist-Leninist rule were themselves
  characterized by scarcity, repression, and
  "<a   href="Political_Repression.md" class="wikilink"
  title="political terror">"political terror</a>
- The few remaining Marxist-Leninist states (China, Vietnam, Laos) have
  introduced extensive
  "<a   href="Market_economy.md" class="wikilink" title="market reforms">"market
  reforms</a>, maintaining party dictatorship while embracing capitalism

### Contrast with Anarchist Experiments

While shorter-lived due to military suppression by both capitalist and
Marxist-Leninist forces, anarchist experiments have demonstrated the
viability of libertarian alternatives:

- **"<a   href="Revolutionary_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Revolutionary Catalonia">"Revolutionary Catalonia</a>**
  (1936-1939): Collectivized agriculture and industry, abolished money
  in some areas, maintained production while fighting fascism, destroyed
  by combined Franco-Communist suppression[^15][^16]
- **"<a   href="Revolutionary_Ukraine.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Free Territory">"Free Territory</a>** (1918-1921): Implemented
  anarchist communism across large territory, defeated White armies,
  betrayed and destroyed by Bolsheviks
- **"<a   href="Shinmin_Prefecture.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Shinmin Prefecture">"Shinmin Prefecture</a>** (1929-1932):
  Korean anarchist society based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation
- Contemporary:
  "<a   href="Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Zapatistas">"Zapatistas</a> in
  "<a   href="Chiapas.md" class="wikilink" title="Chiapas">"Chiapas</a>,

  title="intentional communities">"intentional communities</a> and
  "<a   href="Cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
  title="cooperative networks">"cooperative networks</a> worldwide

These experiments succeeded in implementing genuine working-class
self-management and horizontal organization. They failed not due to
internal contradictions but external military force—often from
Marxist-Leninist forces claiming to represent the workers.
