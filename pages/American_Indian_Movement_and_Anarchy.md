Founded in 1968 by Dennis Banks and George Mitchell, the American Indian
Movement (AIM) seeks liberation for indigenous peoples from colonialism
and oppression. Inspired by the Black Panther Party, AIM combined
community survival programs with armed self-defense, improving
conditions in local communities while bringing worldwide attention to
indigenous struggles. AIM’s anti-colonial analysis, diversity of
tactics, and defense of stateless societies have deeply influenced
anti-authoritarians, and AIM has repeatedly collaborated with
anarchists.

Women of All Red Nations (WARN) has been described as AIM's "feminist
counterpart."[^1] Lorelei DeCora Means, Madonna Thunder Hawk, Phyllis
Young, and Janet McCloud founded WARN in 1974, and 200 women from 30
tribes attended the founding conference that year in Rapid City, South
Dakota. WARN took over leadership roles once leading men in AIM were
targeted by the U.S. government. WARN participated in the Wounded Knee
uprising among collaborations with AIM.[^2] AIM was also in the Rainbow
Coalition with the
"<a   href="Black_Panther_Party_and_Anarchy.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">"Black Panther Party</a>, Young Lords, and
Chicano Crusade for Justice among other groups.[^3]

AIM’s historic high-profile actions included participation in the 1969
"<a   href="Alcatraz_occupation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Alcatraz occupation">"Alcatraz occupation</a>, the 1972 Trail of
Broken Treaties, the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee, and the 1975 Ogala
shootout. In the 1990s, AIM split into two factions. The website of the

# Structure

While AIM had a hierarchical Grand Governing Council, its everyday,
practical functioning was decentralized and horizontal, as AIM political
prisoner Leonard Peltier recalls:

> There was no overarching formal organization following Robert’s Rules
> of Order; there were only individuals and groups of individuals of
> like mind working together in a kind of pure democracy, a disorganized
> but vaguely coherent collectivity of leaders \[…\] There are no
> followers in AIM. We are all leaders. We are each an army of one,
> working for the survival of our people and of the Earth, our
> Mother.[^4]

AIM member Ward Churchill argues that the hierarchical governing council
was a “really bad model” and facilitated the state’s penetration of the
organization:

> The national structure of the American Indian Movement was penetrated
> pretty successfully, because you had people drawn together in an
> organization from a whole variety of locations to function as a sort
> of a governing council. That was a really bad model. Where we were
> impenetrable was actually on the ground with the action end of the
> organization, because these were all family units. The Means family,
> the Robidoux-Peltier family and their cousins were all related and had
> grown up together. Well, how exactly do you plant somebody in the
> middle of that? You don’t.[^5]

# Alcatraz occupation

AIM members participated in the 1969-1971
"<a   href="Alcatraz_occupation.md" class="wikilink"
title="occupation of Alcatraz Island">"occupation of Alcatraz Island</a>
in the San Francisco Bay. Organizing as “Indians of All Tribes,”
hundreds of occupiers organized classes and protests, bringing worldwide
publicity to the demands of indigenous people for health care, fresh
water, employment, and recognition of treaty rights. They offered to
purchase the island for \$24 in beads and cloth, which is what settlers
paid for Manhattan.[^6]

# Trail of Broken Treaties

In 1972, AIM organized caravans of Indians who converged in Washington,
D.C. before the election. They entered the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) building and refused to leave.

> \[T\]he police resorted to clubs and—undoubtedly to their great
> surprise—were quickly overpowered and thrown out themselves. Caravan
> members barricaded the building against police counterattack while BIA
> employees scrambled out windows to escape.[^7]

AIM issued a list of “Twenty Points” which included demands for
restoration of land to Indians, release of Indian prisoners, health care
and housing.[^8] AIM members left the building after the government
promised not to prosecute them for the occupation, but the government
later reneged on its promise.[^9]

# Wounded Knee Siege

In 1973, Lakota traditionalists at the Pine Ridge reservation asked AIM
for defense against the brutality and corruption of BIA police and the
so-called Guardians of the Ogala Nation (GOON) squad led by tribal
president Dick Wilson. AIM held a press conference at the reservation’s
Wounded Knee site on 27 February, when they were unexpectedly surrounded
by federal forces. Ellen Moves Camp, a Lakota traditionalist, explained:
“We didn’t know we were going to be crowded in there by a bunch of guns
and stuff, military and FBIs and marshals and goons. We didn’t talk
about going in there and taking over Wounded Knee. That was the furthest
thing from our minds. But what choice did the government give us?”[^10]

The press conference turned into a “71 day armed occupation in which 300
people resisted a large military and paramilitary force consisting of
FBI agents, BIA police, local and state police, and military
personnel.”[^11]

Hoping to stop violence against AIM, the Anarchist group Movement for a
New Society (MNS) set up nonviolent “observer teams” which stood between
AIM and federal troops. These teams were eventually evicted.[^12]
Government troops and helicopters repeatedly opened fire on the
encampment, killing Frank Clearwater on 16 April and Buddy Lamont on 26
April.[^13]

The occupation garnered surprisingly broad public support. Dennis Banks
recalls:

> Well, there was a Gallup poll, and two questions were asked, ‘Do you
> believe in the American Indian Movement’s tactics of occupying Wounded
> Knee as a means of bringing about political change?’ And the second
> question: ‘Arms have been taken up by members of the American Indian
> Movement. Do you believe arms are needed to bring about this change?’
> And in both polls, 71 percent answered ‘yes’!”[^14]

Women comprised about a third of the armed warriors at Wounded
Knee.[^15] Mary Crow Dog recounts, “We had two or three pistol-packing
mamas swaggering around with six-shooters dangling at their hips, taking
their turns on the firing line, swapping lead with the feds. The Indian
nurses bringing in the wounded under a hail of fire were braver than
many warriors. The men also did their share of the dirty work.”[^16]

Still, women in AIM did notice a gendered division of labor, which Mary
Crow Dog addresses:

> At one time a white volunteer nurse berated us for doing the slave
> work while the men got all the glory. We were betraying the cause of
> womankind, was the way she put it. We told her that her kind of
> women’s lib was a white, middle-class thing, and that at this critical
> stage we had other priorities. Once our men had gotten their rights
> and their balls back, we might start arguing with them about who
> should do the dishes. But not before.[^17]

The Wounded Knee occupation resulted in two measurable victories,
according to AIM member Vine Deloria, Jr. First, Congress authorized in
1974 a two-year study of Indians’ conditions, leading to numerous reform
bills being passed. Second, the occupation led to a “tremendous surge of
interest in traditional religion and customs.”[^18]

# Aftermath and Ogala Firefight

From mid-1973 to late-1976, at least 69 AIM members and supporters were
killed at Pine Ridge, mostly at the hands of the GOONs and BIA
police.[^19] The FBI armed the GOONs and declined to investigate their
activities.[^20] Leonard Peliter reflects, “Seems like the more FBIs we
had around, the more murders we had.”[^21]

In the summer 1975, AIM set up an encampment near the village of Ogala
with help from Lakota traditionalists at Pine Ridge. On the morning of
26 June, the FBI raided the site and opened fire, waking up many of the
residents. AIM members returned fire, mostly warning shots, thinking
that the FBI were GOONs. “Remember,” Peltier writes, “there was near
civil war on the reservation at that time. GOON squads had been
terrorizing the reservation for months, with drive-by shootings,
beatings, outright murders, burning of Elders’ and AIM supporters’
houses going on almost every day.”[^22] Casualties from the firefight
included two FBI members and 60 AIM members and Lakota
traditionalists.[^23]

AIM members fled the scene and were eventually apprehended. In a trial
marked with FBI perjury and fabricated evidence, Peltier was convicted
and given two consecutive life sentences. “Not a single credible witness
said they saw Leonard take aim at anybody that tragic day,” explains
Peltier’s counsel.[^24] During the trial, the FBI covered up their own
lab results that showed no match between the fatal bullet and the weapon
allegedly in Peltier’s hands. In 1985, after Peltier had spent about a
decade in prison, one of the government prosecutors admitted, “We did
not know who shot the agents.”[^25]

# Indian Treaty Council

In 1974, AIM established the International Indian Treaty Council as its
international arm. Its founding "Declaration of Continuing Independence"
insisted:

> Sovereign people of varying cultures have the absolute right to live
> in harmony with Mother Earth so long as they do not infringe upon this
> same right of other peoples. The denial of this right to any sovereign
> people, such as the Native American Indian Nations, must be challenged
> by truth and action. World concern must focus on all colonial
> governments to the end that sovereign people everywhere shall live as
> they choose; in peace with dignity and freedom.[^26]

The Council sent a delegation to the International Conference of
Solidarity with the Independence of Puerto Rico in Havana, and
established relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization.

When Iranian students took 52 U.S. diplomats hostage in 1979, the Treaty
Council hepled secure the hostages' peaceful release. The students
trusted the Treaty Council due to its PLO ties, and they allowed the
hostages to receive mail and packages only if delivered by the Treaty
Council in person. The UN secretary general thanked the Treaty Council
for facilitating "the negotiation of a peaceful settlement."[^27]

# Murders of Anna Mae Aquash and Ray Robinson

The U.S. government alleges that high-ranking AIM leaders murdered Ray
Robinson in 1973 and Anna Mae Aquash in 1975. Some activists maintain
that the FBI directly murdered these individuals. What's certain is that
the murders occurred in a context of FBI surveillance and resulting
paranoia. The FBI had snitch-jacketed (accused of being informants) both
Robinson and Aquash. Whomever pulled the trigger, the FBI were either
directly or indirectly responsible for Robinson and Aquash's deaths.

The Black civil rights fighter Ray Robinson went to AIM’s Wounded Knee
occupation and was suspected of being an informant. Steve Hendricks
describes an account of what happened next:

> AIM members seized him, interrogated him, and shot and killed him.
> Whether the shot was intentional or an accidental misfire of a weapon
> pointed at him remains a mystery, but credible witnesses say that
> several leaders, including Banks and Means, conspired about what to do
> with Robinson’s body. By one account, it was Banks himself who ordered
> Robinson buried in the hills around Wounded Knee.[^28]

Anna Mae Aquash, one of AIM’s most prominent women, was discovered dead
on 24 February 1976. In 2004, AIM member John Trudell testified that,
before the body was identified, Dennis Banks said to him, “You know that
body they found? That is Annie Mae.” Moreover, Trudell has said based on
conversations with the accused accessory Arlo Looking Cloud that in fact
AIM member John Boy did shoot Anna and that high-ranking AIM officials
Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt were present at the murder. Russell Means
has corroborated the involvement of the Bellecourts: “Vernon Bellecourt
made the phone call. Clyde took the call and issued the order for her
murder.”[^29]

For a selection of documents blaming the FBI for the murders, see Gord
Hill's pamphlet "A Report on the Case of Anna Mae Pictou."[^30]

# Split

By 1993, AIM split into two factions. One was the American Indian
Movement Grand Governing Council, based in Minneapolis and still under
the leadership of the Bellecourts. This side retained a centralized
structure.[^31]

The other faction, based in Colorado, was the International
Confederation of Autonomous Chapters of the American Indian Movement.
This latter group had a more decentralized structure, summarized in its
1993 Edgewood Declaration: “AIM has been, and is today, a confederation
of autonomous chapters, dedicated to the freedom of indigenous peoples
everywhere. We do not need bosses, we do not need gurus or our own
tyrants to remind us of the work that needs to be done, or how to do
it.”[^32]

The anarchistic thinkers Russell Means and Ward Churchill belonged to
the decentralized faction. Means criticized (orthodox) Marxism’s
dominant assumption that the disappearance of indigenous cultures
represented historic progress: “Revolutionary Marxism is committed to
even further perpetuation and perfection of the very industrial process
which is destroying us all.” Means also said that Anarchism retained
similar views of “progress” that need to be discarded.[^33] Ward
Churchill has written for Anarchist presses and defended the Black Bloc
tactic. Churchill has identified as an Indigenist rather than an
Anarchist, defining an Indigenist as “one who not only takes the rights
of indigenous peoples as the highest priority of \[one’s\] political
life, but who draws upon the traditions—the bodies of knowledge and
corresponding codes of values—evolved over many thousands of years by
native peoples the world over.”[^34] In an interview, Churchill noted
the similarities between Anarchism and Indigenism:

> The two are not interchangeable, point for point, but they have far
> more in common than they have dividing them, if each is properly
> understood. And part of the task here is to make them properly
> understood. If you look at green anarchy, for better or worse, you’re
> going to find all kinds of references to commonalities with indigenous
> peoples on every basis, from social organisation to environmental
> perspective. It will take some time, but you can make that conceptual
> bridge between indigenism and anarchism, and it’s understood. I would
> see the main distinction, on this continent, as being a detachment
> from base. Indigenous peoples are grounded, quite literally. There’s a
> relationship to the land that has evolved over thousands of years, and
> that’s completely denied to the people from the settler culture who
> self-describe as anarchists. With that distinction made, however,
> we’ve got all kinds of principles in common, aspirations in common,
> perspectives in common, and we need to build upon those in order to
> develop a respectful set of relations that allow us to act in unity
> against that common oppressor that we share.[^35]

The Grand Governing Council has claimed that Churchill is an “academic
fraud, literary fraud, and Indian fraud.”[^36]

# Transform Columbus Day

In October 2001, Colorado AIM invited Anarchists to help shut down
Denver's Columbus Day parade. For several days prior to the parade,
Colorado AIM and its supporters took the streets, with about 75 people
in a black bloc on 6 October. On 8 October, the day of the parade, about
300 anti-colonialists assembled, including 75 in a black bloc. They were
planning to disrupt the parade, when they received welcome news: most
Columbus Day marchers didn't even dare showing up. By organizing lager
numbers and by threatening (without using) force, Colorado AIM and its
Anarchist supporters almost cancelled the Columbus Day parade and turned
its remaining marchers into a laughing stock.

> Then all of a sudden Nita Gonzalez got on the mic and announced that
> there was only 30 people at the parade which they were calling a
> procession. Everyone cheered and laughed and more speakers began.
> Every single person that got on the mic specifically thanked the Black
> Bloc. It was crazy. Never had we felt so loved and supported. Russell
> Means spoke about how he wanted to transform our society into one
> where "anarchists wouldn't be afraid to walk the streets." Glen Morris
> said that he was an anarchist and that all of his ancestors were
> too.[^37]
