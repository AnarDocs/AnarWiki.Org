Some scholars argue the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk, in its earliest
stages starting around 4000 BCE, had gender egalitarianism and
participatory self-governance. The Great Court would have accommodated
popular decision-making, and celebration of the goddess Inanna may have
signified a strong status of women. However, by the late fourth and
early third millennium, Uruk was colonial power with a clear state.
Uruk's culture borrowed many elements from the preceding cultures of

David Graeber and David Wengrow note that the Great Court was much
larger than the Pnyx where the <a href="Athenian_polis.md" class="wikilink"
title="Athenian polis">Athenian polis</a> met, even though Uruk had a
smaller population than classical Athens. "This suggests a wider range
of participation, which would make sense if women were not entirely
excluded and if early Uruk did not, like later Athens, define some 20
per cent of its population as resident aliens with no voting
rights."[^1]

Prior to the late foruth millennium, the closest Uruk had to a ruler may
have been a male priest who is shown on imagery such as vases and
statues. He's sometimes called a "priest-king," but there's "little we
can say" about what political functions he might have held outside of
ceremony and warfare.[^2] He was sometimes portrayed as nude, which may
have suggested a lack of gravitas toward him that a population would pay
toward an actual king.[^3]

Peter Gelderloos emphasizes the religious authority that these priests
may have held:

> Dating to around 4000 BCE, Uruk was the first city in the world. Prior
> and also contemporaneous to Uruk, the Fertile Crescent was filled with
> small farming settlements going back several thousand years to the
> development of agriculture in the region between 10,000 and 8000 BCE.
> In the centuries before and after the founding of Uruk, these
> settlements tended to contain small shrines, governed over by ensi, or
> priest-kings, assisted by a council of elders. They constituted a weak
> central power with a primarily religious authority, probably backed by
> age and lineage hierarchies.

Anti-civilization theorist Fredy Perlman, in *Against History, Against
Leviathan*, speaks somewhat appreciatively of the earlier stages of Uruk
which he calls by its Biblical name Erech (parenthetical clarifications
added):

> "From the standpoint of the Sumerians, nothing changes. In a sense
> they never leave the state of nature. This is probably what accounts
> for the exoticism that will continue to cling to what we will call
> 'early civilizations.' The Sumerians haven’t become zeks (prisoners).
> They’re still possessed. Sumerian women still give birth, not as
> machines for the production of soldiers and workers, but as living
> beings in close contact with the sources of Being. Sumerian men,
> especially older ones, still seek contact with the spirits of the
> winds, the clouds, even of the sky itself. In fact, they devote
> themselves to their searches more completely than they ever could
> before. Now all their energies are devoted to the dances, festivals

# Rise of state

Abdullah Öcalan posits that between 3500 and 3000 BCE, Uruk established
a "colonial system" marking "the transition from the gift economy
\[...\] to commodity (or exchange) economy."[^5] Noting a decline in
woman-goddess figurines, Öcalan hypothesizes that a shift from
egalitarianism to patriarchy in Uruk coincided with the rise of the
state:

> "The fact that the founder goddess of Uruk is Inanna shows that she is
> far more ancient than \[king\] Gilgamesh and that the role of the
> mother-woman was still the leading one at the time.... Over time, less
> and less figurines of the woman-goddess were made and apparently, with
> the onset of the Babylon period, the woman-goddess had been destroyed:
> Woman now was an official public and private prostitute as well as a
> slave."[^6]

Graeber and Wengrow hypothesize a major shift, around 3200 BCE,
evidenced by the destruction of assembly spaces and public buildings
associated with the goddess Ianna:

> "Around 3200 BC the original public buildings of the Eanna sanctuary
> were razed and covered with debris, and its sacred landscape
> redesigned around a series of gated courts and ziggurats. By 2900 BC,
> we have evidence for local kings of rival city-states battling it out
> for supremacy over Uruk, in response to which a five- and-a-half-mile
> fortification wall (whose building was later attributed to Gilgamesh)
> went up around the city’s perimeter. Within a few centuries, city
> rulers were setting themselves up as neighbours of the goddesses and
> the gods, building their own palatial houses on the doorstep to the
> House of Heaven and stamping their names into its sacred
> brickwork."[^7]

By the end of the fourth millennium, James Scott notes, "political and
economic dominance over a modest agricultural hinterland, as well as a
structured city government." Between 3300 and 3000, Uruk installed a
defensive wall. By 3200, tax collection and administrative bureaucracy
were firmly in place.[^8]

It appears that Uruk's religion, while on one hand preserving much that
was fulfilling about forager life, also created the specialist roles of
Priest and Priestess which laid the groundwork for the rise of the
State. Religious hierarchies would become religious hierarchies. Perlman
speculates:

> "But the golden Sumerians are no longer all of Sumer. In fact, in some
> later scholarly accounts, the golden Sumerians will not even exist.
> They will be dismissed with a single word. The word is Temple. The
> devotees of Inanna, the loving daughter of the Moon; the communicants
> with Anu, the spirit of the sky, are not the users of the new
> implements. They are not the administrators of the irrigation works,
> the builders of the great palaces, the heroes of the military
> encounters. They are what we will call Priests and Priestesses,
> oracles and diviners. All that is left in Sumer from the state of
> nature has shrunken to what we will call Religion."[^9]

Climate stresses had a key role in the emergence of statehood. From 3500
to 2500 BCE, increasing aridity forced people to live in more
concentrated areas and made irrigation more laborious. This geographic
concentration made foraging less viable and made urban residents
increasingly reliant on cereal grains which are easily legible and
taxable from above. Scott writes, "Climate change, then, by forcing a
kind of urbanization in which 90 percent of the population lived in
settlements of thirty hectares or more, intensified the
grain-and-manpower modules that were ideal for state formation."[^10]
