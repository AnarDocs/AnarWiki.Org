# Affinity Groups

An **affinity group** is a small autonomous collective of individuals
who organize together based on shared politics, trust, and friendship to
engage in direct action and mutual support. Affinity groups function as
the fundamental organizational unit of anarchist practice, emphasizing
decentralized decision-making, horizontal organization, and voluntary
association.

## Origins

The affinity group model emerged from the Spanish anarchist and workers'
movement of the late 19th century. Small circles of friends called
*tertulias* would meet at cafes to discuss ideas and plan actions.[^1]
In 1888, during a period of class conflict in Europe and local
insurrection in Spain, the Anarchist Organization of the Spanish Region
formalized this traditional form as the basis of its organization.[^2]

The Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI), which contained 50,000
activists, organized into affinity groups that confederated into local,
regional, and national councils. These affinity groups remained
autonomous while carrying out education and organizing local struggles.
The intimacy of the groups made police infiltration difficult.[^3]

### Revival in North America

The affinity group model was reintroduced to radical direct action in
North America by anti-nuclear activists during the 1970s.[^4] On April
30, 1977, 2,500 people organized into affinity groups occupied the
Seabrook, New Hampshire nuclear power plant, demonstrating the model's
effectiveness for large-scale coordinated actions.[^5] The growing
anti-nuclear power and disarmament movements adopted this mode
throughout the late 1970s and 1980s.

Since then, affinity groups have been used by the Central America
solidarity movement, lesbian and gay liberation movement, Earth First!
and earth liberation movement, and in mass actions against institutions
like the WTO, IMF, World Bank, and political party conventions.[^6]

## Structure and Function

### Size and Composition

Affinity groups typically consist of 2 to 15 people, though the optimal
size depends on specific goals and contexts.[^7] The group should remain
small enough that informal conversation about pressing matters remains
possible. In actions requiring vehicles, one common approach is having
one affinity group per vehicle.[^8]

The "affinity" between members refers to shared political analysis,
tactical approaches, and mutual trust developed through relationships
and shared experience. People in an affinity group focus on taking
action on the same issues and share aims and tactics.[^9]

### Decision-Making

Affinity groups operate through consensus decision-making rather than
majority rule. Every individual involved must be satisfied with
decisions for the group to function smoothly under stress.[^10] Before
actions, members establish together their personal and collective goals,
acceptable risks, and expectations of each other.[^11]

Democratic voting, where the majority gets their way and the minority
must accept the outcome, contradicts the affinity group model. The
emphasis is on collective agreement according to the needs and desires
of every individual involved.[^12]

### Autonomy

Each affinity group answers to itself alone and makes all important
decisions internally, even when participating in larger actions.[^13]
This autonomy means groups need not pass decisions through complicated
ratification processes and can act and react instantly without waiting
for orders from a centralized body.[^14]

Freedom to associate and organize as each person sees fit is a
fundamental anarchist principle underlying the affinity group model.
This promotes redundancy so no one person or group is essential to the
functioning of the whole, and different groups can reconfigure as
needed.[^15]

## Building and Sustaining Groups

### Developing Trust and Intimacy

Members should learn each other's strengths, vulnerabilities, and
backgrounds to know what they can count on each other for. Discussing
analyses of situations and identifying where perspectives match,
complement, or differ prepares groups for split-second decisions.[^16]

While reading and discussing texts together can develop political
intimacy, on-the-ground experience is more valuable. Groups should start
slow to avoid overextending, establishing common language and healthy
internal dynamics before identifying objectives and going into
action.[^17]

Getting to know each other can happen through informal activities like
shared meals, bike rides, or social time together. Even quick
conversations before actions about hopes and needs can make significant
differences.[^18]

### Security Culture

Affinity groups resist infiltration because all members share history
and intimacy with each other, and no one outside the group need be
informed of their plans or activities.[^19]

Once assembled, an affinity group should establish shared security
practices and maintain them consistently. In some cases, activities can
be public and transparent. In others, what goes on within the group
should never be spoken of outside it, even after activities are
completed. Sometimes no one except participants should know the group
exists at all.[^20] It is easier to move from high security protocols to
lower ones than the reverse.[^21]

### Sustainability

Groups should be realistic about how much they take on and allow time
between actions for rest. Organizing social time together helps members
stay connected during periods between actions. Pacing can also serve
strategic purposes, as gradually escalating actions can make bigger
impacts on targets.[^22]

Sharing and improving skills within groups increases effectiveness,
enhances autonomy, and prevents informal hierarchies from developing
when some people have more experience than others. Tasks like
facilitating meetings or researching targets can be rotated so everyone
gains confidence.[^23]

Groups should watch for signs of burnout, including emotional and
physical fatigue, lingering illnesses, or feelings of disempowerment and
hopelessness. Members should be ready to ease workloads even if it means
accomplishing less as a group.[^24]

## Roles and Coordination

### Internal Roles

Within actions, affinity group members may take on specific roles based
on their skills, preferences, and ability to risk arrest. Common roles
include:[^25]

- Medical support for health issues during actions
- Legal observers to document police conduct and rights violations
- Media liaisons to communicate with press
- Action support for general wellness (water, encouragement, morale)
- Traffic control for safety during moving actions
- Arrestable members willing to risk arrest
- Jail support to coordinate with lawyers and track arrestees

### Buddy Systems

Within affinity groups, particularly larger ones, people can pair up as
buddies to provide additional support. Buddies commit to knowing each
other's particular needs, checking that their buddy remains with the
group, ensuring their buddy's physical well-being, monitoring emotional
states, leaving together if needed, and providing support if
arrested.[^26] In many ways is similar to the 19th century anarchists
practice of <a href="Companionship" class="wikilink"
title="Companionship">Companionship</a>.

### Clusters

A cluster is a grouping of affinity groups that come together to work on
specific tasks or parts of larger actions. Clusters might be responsible
for blockading an area, organizing one day of multi-day actions, or
coordinating mass performances. Clusters can organize around geography,
issues or identities, or tactical approaches.[^27]

The cluster formation enables larger numbers of individuals to act with
the same advantages single affinity groups have. If speed or security is
needed, representatives of each group can meet ahead of time rather than
entire groups. Over years of collaboration, different affinity groups
can know each other as well as they know themselves.[^28]

### Spokescouncils

When several clusters need to coordinate large actions, they can hold
spokescouncil meetings where different affinity groups and clusters
inform one another of their intentions to whatever extent is wise. Each
affinity group or cluster empowers a spoke (representative) to attend
these meetings.[^29]

Spokescouncils are not decision-making bodies that produce binding
conclusions. They provide forums for affinity groups to share
pre-formulated proposals for action, after which interested parties meet
separately to plan logistics while uninterested groups make their own
plans accordingly.[^30]

Spokescouncils rarely produce seamless unanimity, but they apprise
participants of various desires and perspectives at play. The
independence and spontaneity that decentralization provides are usually
the greatest advantages against better-equipped adversaries.[^31]

### Bottomlining

For affinity groups and larger structures to function effectively,
everyone involved must reliably follow through on commitments. When
plans are agreed upon, each individual in a group and each group in a
cluster should choose one or more critical aspects of preparation and
execution and offer to bottomline them.[^32]

Bottomlining means guaranteeing that a resource or project will be
accomplished no matter what. If operating a legal hotline during a
demonstration, someone must handle it even if the primary person gets
sick. If a group promises to provide banners, they must be ready even if
that requires staying up all night because others couldn't
participate.[^33]

## Action Planning and Execution

### Choosing Actions

Groups should start with their aims, then choose targets (people or
organizations to pressure) and tactics (specific activities to
undertake). This often involves research to determine what kind of
pressure actions will put on targets—economic damage, delay, or negative
publicity.[^34]

Some affinity groups intervene quickly in emerging situations like
resisting evictions or immigration raids. For these actions, groups can
establish general processes they will use each time rather than planning
each action from scratch.[^35]

### Making Plans

Groups should make thorough plans for timing and carrying out actions.
This includes determining roles people will take based on skills,
preferences, and ability to risk arrest. Members should feel comfortable
with their roles and receive support to prepare confidently.[^36]

Planning should address potential scenarios: how to act toward people
encountered during actions, what to do if situations escalate or police
intervene, how to respond if unplanned opportunities arise, when to end
actions, and what to do if someone needs to leave.[^37]

Since action situations are unpredictable and plans rarely unfold as
anticipated, groups can prepare both specific scenario-based plans (if A
happens, switch to plan B) and flexible structures useful regardless of
what occurs (resources, internal roles, communication systems, general
strategies, escape routes, legal support).[^38]

### During Actions

Affinity groups can make quick decisions in changing situations. When
time is limited—police threatening arrest or brief opportunities
arising—groups need processes for rapid consensus decision-making.[^39]

Members should check in regularly to ensure everyone is okay. The high
level of trust and understanding of each other's needs within functional
affinity groups allows members to rely on each other for support and
adherence to agreements.[^40]

### Debriefing

After actions, groups should debrief to regroup, check how actions
affected people, and evaluate outcomes. Even for one-time actions or
when time is limited, groups should try to debrief for at least half an
hour as soon as possible. Agreeing on debrief times and locations
beforehand helps ensure they happen.[^41]

Structured debriefs help ensure all voices are heard. Topics can include
what worked well and what didn't, how people felt during and after, what
support people need, and how lessons can apply to future actions.
Debriefs are opportunities to celebrate achievements while supporting
people to process difficult or traumatic events.[^42]

After debriefs, shrewd affinity groups meet in secure locations without
electronics to discuss what went well, what could have improved, and
what comes next.[^43]

## Strengths of the Affinity Group Model

### Effectiveness and Power

Relative to their small size, affinity groups achieve disproportionately
powerful impacts. Unlike top-down structures, they adapt freely to
situations without passing decisions through complicated ratification
processes. All participants can act and react instantly without waiting
for orders while maintaining clear expectations of one another.[^44]

The mutual admiration and inspiration on which affinity groups are
founded make them difficult to demoralize. They function without
hierarchy or coercion, contrasting sharply with capitalist, fascist, and
socialist structures. Participating in affinity groups can be fulfilling
and fun as well as effective.[^45]

Affinity groups are motivated by shared desire and loyalty rather than
profit, duty, or other compensation or abstraction. Squads of riot
police have been held at bay by affinity groups armed only with tear gas
canisters shot at them.[^46]

Ten groups of ten people taking direct action can often achieve more
than 100 people acting en masse. Because affinity groups make decisions
autonomously, they react quickly and creatively when situations change.
This provides uncertainty for authorities that many actions can exploit
effectively with just a few people.[^47]

### Support and Well-Being

Having groups of people looking out for one another throughout actions
or during long campaigns ensures everyone receives care. Stress, fear,
police repression, and campaign setbacks are dealt with more easily
collectively than individually. Sharing needs and paying careful
attention to well-being before, during, and after actions helps groups
be more sustainable and long-lasting.[^48]

### Participation and Direct Democracy

The affinity group model ensures everyone participates equally in making
decisions and taking action together. This is not only effective for
ensuring people feel committed to actions, but also puts values of
equality and direct democracy into practice.[^49]

### Security

Planning actions in small groups makes them much more likely to happen
without targets or police finding out first. Small trusted groups are
far more secure than large planning meetings. Working in affinity groups
also limits damage if movements have been infiltrated by undercover
police or industry agents.[^50]

## Flexibility of the Model

Some affinity groups are formal and immersive, with participants living
together and sharing everything in common. But affinity groups need not
be permanent arrangements. They can serve as structures of convenience,
assembled from pools of interested and trusted people for the duration
of given projects.[^51]

Particular teams can act together repeatedly as affinity groups, but
members can also break into smaller affinity groups, participate in
other affinity groups, or act outside the affinity group structure
entirely.[^52]

Affinity groups can be formed just for one action or can be ongoing
groups that organize and take part in actions over years.[^53] They can
be long-term relationships among friends and activists lasting years, or
week-long relationships based around single actions.[^54]

The basic formula is feeling out desires, talking with comrades,
surveying situations, and taking actions or forming projects that make
sense. When the focus is explicitly not recruitment, possibilities open
up and people realize they have more power than previously thought.[^55]

## Applications

Affinity groups can undertake virtually any activity. They can drop
banners, blockade roads, provide backup for other affinity groups,
perform street theater, block traffic on bicycles, organize tree sits,
change billboard messages, play in radical marching bands, provide
medical support, bring food and water during actions, and countless
other activities.[^56]

Affinity groups have planted and defended community gardens, built and
occupied and burned down buildings, organized neighborhood childcare
programs and wildcat strikes. Individual affinity groups routinely
initiate revolutions in visual arts and popular music. Bands are
affinity groups. An affinity group invented the airplane.[^57]

An affinity group could be a sewing circle or bicycle maintenance
collective. It could come together to provide a meal at an occupation or
force a multinational corporation out of business through carefully
orchestrated sabotage programs.[^58]

Affinity groups need not be explicitly political—bands and sewing
circles are examples of affinity groups operating on the same principles
of voluntary association, shared purpose, and collective
decision-making.[^59]

## Critique of Alternative Models

### Hierarchical Organizations

When people with radical politics first seek out organization, they
often join formal organizations with names that sound appealing. Usually
when working in such groups, they spend significant time and energy on
the organization itself rather than working toward stated goals.
Bureaucracies work this way: the number one priority is always for the
organization to continue existing, with everything else subordinate to
that. In contrast, affinity groups are structured to facilitate
action—it doesn't matter if the group exists or not, as the affinity
group is a tool belonging to people with shared ideals and goals, not
the other way around.[^60]

Contemporary society does not create people experienced in taking
initiative, with healthy methods of engaging in conflict with each
other, and in touch with what they want. Instead, it promotes obedience,
passivity, apathy, and toxic social relationships. Being in ranks of
hierarchical political parties or mass-based groups where decisions go
through democratic bottlenecks does not encourage liberation. These
groups require participants to follow orders just as much as bosses and
cops do.[^61]

### Mass Assemblies

Massive general assemblies acting as decision-making bodies discourage
individuals or small groups from taking action on their own. Since
decisions must be agreed upon in general assemblies, initiatives agreed
upon are those ruffling the least feathers—often the most conservative
and banal. The only creativity channeled is manipulation, a talent
needed by competing sects trying to wrestle control through political
maneuvering.[^62]

This dynamic occurred in Students for a Democratic Society in the late
1960s and again in the 2000s, demonstrating problems with democratic
decision-making bodies.[^63] While some situations require coordination
on larger scales, affinity groups maintain autonomy while collaborating
rather than subjecting themselves to majority rule.

## Common Issues

### Involving New Members

Some groups struggle with attracting new members and making them feel
included while maintaining original group ethos. If ethos and methods
aren't clear to new members from the start, problems can arise later.
Groups might also decide to remain closed if they have enough people to
accomplish their goals and therefore don't invite others to join.[^64]

Being explicit from the start about core aims and agreements, taking
time to explain these to new members, and ensuring opportunities for
discussion around difficult issues helps address this challenge.
Creating space for new members to actively shape groups helps them feel
committed and motivated.[^65]

### Informal Hierarchies

All groups are affected by power dynamics in society, meaning some
members are more likely to have voices in meetings, lead
decision-making, or have their needs met. Dynamics within groups can
lead to informal hierarchies—for example, because particular people are
seen as having more experience and skills or access to more information
than others.[^66]

Problems often arise when some people are seen as more committed,
perhaps because they always attend meetings and actions. Creation of
"cores" of people who always turn up often leads to informal
decision-making outside meetings, creating unintentional
hierarchies.[^67]

Using good facilitation with emphasis on supporting everyone to
participate, varying meeting times so different people can attend,
ensuring people who miss meetings still get told about next ones,
allowing people who missed meetings to still take on tasks, rotating
jobs and roles, and building in skill-sharing helps address these
dynamics.[^68]

### Failure to Reach Agreement

Groups sometimes struggle to reach agreement on decisions. If
disagreements are about fundamental questions like aims and tactics,
groups may simply lack sufficient common ground to work together.
Alternatively, less fundamental disagreements may be blinding groups to
common ground they do have.[^69]

Groups may need to revisit important questions about aims and principles
they have in common and targets and tactics they agree on using.
Reminding themselves of achievements from working together can help.
Often disagreements may be resolved by stepping back, sharing underlying
needs and concerns, and working together to reach solutions fulfilling
everyone's needs.[^70]

### Mass Actions

Joining mass actions as affinity groups can be powerful and exciting but
poses questions of maintaining group autonomy. It can be difficult to
plan and act independently, especially when relying on overall
organizers for information and infrastructure.[^71]

Organizing or attending skill-shares can help groups reach points where
they can cover all their own needs for entire actions (group work
skills, media skills, first aid skills, legal knowledge). Groups may
also choose to participate in mass actions with scope for planning their
own roles—for instance, mass blockades might involve several affinity
groups taking different entrances or access roads, deciding within their
groups where and how to form blockades at coordinated times.
Alternatively, affinity groups might take responsibility for particular
roles like legal support, first aid, or providing food.[^72]
