> In France, the Parisian sectional assemblies of 1793 were the most
> democratic and radical political institutions to emerge during the
> course of the Great Revolution.
>
> In preparation for the epochal meeting of the Estates General in
> Versailles in 1789, the French monarchy was obliged to establish
> electoral districts throughout France, where commoners could gather in
> assemblies to choose their deputies for the Third Estate—or rather, to
> choose an intermediate set of electors, who in turn would choose the
> deputies, so disinclined was the monarchy to allow even propertied
> commoners to vote directly. Sixty district assemblies were constituted
> in Paris, Where they duly carried out their task. But once they chose
> their deputies, the Parisian assemblies persisted in meeting— even
> though they had lost their legal reason for existence. Thus, even as
> the Estates General—soon renamed the National Assembly—was meeting in
> Versailles, the Parisian district assemblies kept meeting regularly as
> quasi-legal bodies, acting as guardians of their limited freedoms in
> the fast-moving political situation.
>
> After December 1789 such assemblies became the legal basis for
> municipal government in all the large French cities. The National
> Assembly, and later the Constituent Assembly that followed it,
> reconfigured Paris’s sixty districts into forty-eight sections; all
> the other large French cities—Lyons and Marseilles, Bordeaux and
> Toulouse—were divided into sections as well, with assemblies to look
> after community affairs. Collectively the various sectional assemblies
> in a city exercised control over that city’s central municipal
> authority, or commune.
>
> As the revolution unfolded, about 44,000 autonomous local communes—the
> large ones controlled by sectional assemblies—occupied much of the
> political realm in France, concerning themselves not only with local
> but with national issues. They acquired the power to call out their
> own branches of the National Guard, and in both structure and
> political content, they became increasing democratic and radical. In
> Paris the sectional assemblies even opened their doors to all adult
> males—and in some cases to women—regardless of property or status
> qualifications. Indeed, the Parisian sections themselves formed the
> basis for an extremely radical direct civic democracy.
>
> This sectional movement, which matured in Paris in 1792 and 1793, was
> a self-conscious direct-democratic phenomenon. Regardless of whether
> its members were politically radical, each popular assembly formed the
> fundamental deliberative and decision-making body of its section.
> Ideologically, the sectionnaires regarded popular sovereignty as an
> inalienable right to be enjoyed by all citizens, one that could not to
> be preempted by representatives to national assemblies. Meeting in
> expropriated Chapels and churches, each sectional assembly elected six
> deputies to the Paris Commune, one of whose major functions was to
> coordinate all the sections in the city.
>
> Each section was also possessed of a variety of committees that
> performed such functions as police, supply, finance, and neighbourhood
> surveillance. Of paramount importance, each section also had its own
> battalion of the National Guard, including an artillery unit, over
> which it exercised complete control and whose movements it alone could
> authorize. The sectionnaires interested themselves passionately in
> these military units: assembly meetings in which National Guard
> officers were elected drew the greatest attendance, greater even than
> those in which civilian officials were elected.
>
> In 1793, during the height of the Parisian radical democracy,
> sectional life was vibrant, disputatious, and earthy. Periods of
> crisis might attract a thousand citizens or more to an assembly
> meeting, often crowding the hall to the bursting point, while debates
> were often vigorous, the various factions contending With one another
> heatedly. Some sectional assemblies were genuine political
> battlegrounds. Within a particular section, citizens’ interests might
> vary widely according to economic status, ideology, and social
> background—during even the most militant periods of the revolution,
> royalists and moderates still turned out for meetings, as well as
> extreme radicals. Furious confrontations often exploded into threats,
> shouts, and mutual recrimination, not to speak of fistfights.
>
> The radical sectionnaires who occupied this political realm were the
> same people Who invaded the Tuileries in August 1792 and deposed the
> king, leading to his execution; and who teetered on the brink of a
> radical insurrection against the Convention in June 1793. (Had it been
> successful, this insurrection might have given full power to a
> national confederation of sectional assemblies.) It was during this
> last period of ferment that the radical democrat Jean Varlet, Whose
> political home was the section called Droits de l’Homme, tried to
> organize delegates from each section into a counterpower that would
> constitute a “Commune of communes,” a confederation of cities and
> towns (communes) over all of France, to supplant the National
> Convention. In effect, the radical sectionnaires stood at forefront of
> the revolutionary movement in France. It was no doubt for this reason
> that. their leaders were among the first to be arrested by the Jacobin
> regime when it came to power in June 1793.

> Derived from the district assemblies, the sectional assemblies had
> elbowed their way into existence in flat defiance of the Nation-State
> that created them. They went on to provide the institutional structure
> for an extraordinary direct democracy, and as such they constitute yet
> another important moment in that abiding tradition. For libertarian
> municipalism they have a particular importance, since they were not
