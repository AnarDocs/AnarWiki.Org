Mashkan-shapir was an ancient Mesopotamian city which the archeologists
Elizabeth Stone and Paul Zimansky say had a "relatively uncentralized"
social structure. Although there was a temple and a walled-off
administrative building, these sites were clustered apart from the
harbor and city gates where commerce took place. Additionally,
"Mesopotamian texts do not identify clearly differentiated social
classes. Instead they record the importance of general assemblies in
decision making." The archeologists conclude that "the grounds for
seeking the origins of civilization in processes of conquest and
coercion seem, at the very least, far from compelling."[^1]

David Graeber and David Wengrow summarize:

> "intensive archaeological survey of the city’s harbour, gateways and
> residential districts revealed a strik- ingly even distribution of
> wealth, craft production and administrative tools across the five main
> districts, with no obvious centre of commercial or political
> power"[^2]
