Situated west of Spain, the fictional Land of Cokaygne was a stateless
and communist utopia in medieval Europe's anticlerical Christian poetry.
In Cokaygne, people never worked and instead spent their days drinking
from rivers of wine and milk, eating an abundant array of fruits, cakes,
and meats, and using their spiritual powers to fly around. Residents
lived in gender-specific monastic orders, but men and women frequently
visited each other, swam with each other naked, and seemed to enjoy a
culture of sexual liberty. According to the anonymous fourteenth-century
poet of "The Land of Cokaygne," residents of this utopia enjoyed
pleasures far greater than even those found in the relatively bland and
sober Christian heaven.[^1]

Everyone had as much food, drink, and clothing as they desired without
the need for any "trouble or toil." It was always daytime, and no one
ever died or fought with each other.

> There are many sweet sights; it is always day, never night. There is
> no quarrelling or strife, no death but ever life. There is no lack of
> food or clothing, and no man or woman is ever wroth.[^2]

According to the twentieth-century Anarchist Murray Bookchin, Cokaygne
was an "utterly anarchic" land with "an almost Dionysian, sensuously
earthly world of nature."[^3] The fourteenth-century poem portrayed no
explicit social hierarchy aside from a rotating authority position held
by the father abbot who called the monks for communal meals. Passages
about polygamous marriage and the communal drumming of a nun's buttocks
imply a patriarchal form of libertinism, or at least an objectifying
attitude held by the poet.

Reproduced below is the *Medieval Forum's* of "The Land of Cokaygne.":

> Far across the sea, west of Spain, is a land called Cokaygne, the
> richest under heaven. Paradise is merry and bright, but Cokaygne is a
> fairer sight. What is there in Paradise but grass and flowers, and
> green branches?
>
> Though there is joy and great pleasure, fruit is the only food. There
> is no hall, bower or bench, and only water to quench man’s thirst.
> Only two men, Elijah and Enoch, are there, and live sorrowfully alone.
>
> In Cokaygne food and drink are had without worry, trouble or toil. The
> meat is choice and the drink is clear at every meal: noon, afternoon
> and evening. I swear this land has no peer under heaven or on earth
> for such joy and bliss.
>
> There are many sweet sights; it is always day, never night. There is
> no quarrelling or strife, no death but ever life. There is no lack of
> food or clothing, and no man or woman is ever wroth.
>
> There is no serpent, wolf, fox, nor horse, nag, cow nor ox. There is
> no sheep, swine or goat, and no studs or places for breeding horses.
> There is no filth, and the land is filled with other goodness: no
> flies, fleas or lice in clothing or bed, town or house, and no vile
> worms or snails. There is no thunder, sleet, hail, rain, storm or
> wind. There is no blindness, and all is games, joy, and play. One is
> lucky to be there.
>
> There are fine, great rivers of oil, milk, honey, and wine; water
> serves no purpose except as a sight and for washing. There are many
> kinds of fruit, and all is enjoyment and delight.
>
> There is a fair abbey for monks, white and grey, and its chambers and
> halls have walls made of pies filled with fish and rich meats, the
> most delicious man can eat. The shingles on the church, cloisters,
> bowers and hall are wheat cakes, and the pinnacles are fat puddings,
> rich enough for princes and kings. All may be rightfully eaten without
> blame, for it is shared in common by young and old, strong and stern,
> meek and bold.
>
> The cloister is fair and light, broad and long, a lovely sight. All
> the pillars are of crystal, with base and capital of green jasper and
> red coral. In the meadow is a beautiful tree, with roots of ginger and
> sweet cypress and shoots of zedoary. Its flowers are choice nutmegs,
> the bark sweet-smelling cinnamon, and its fruit delicious cloves;
> there was no lack of peppercorns. The red roses and lovely lilies
> never fade and are a sweet sight
>
> There are four wells in the abbey, of treacle, healing water, balm and
> mead, ever-flowing streams from a bed of precious stones and gold.
> There are the sapphire, pearl, carbuncle, astriune, emerald,
> chrysaprase, beryl, onyx, topaz, amethyst, crysolite, chalcedony, and
> hepatite.
>
> The birds are many and of various kinds: the thrush and nightingale,
> lark and woodpecker, and countless others that never cease singing
> merrily day and night. Yet I have more to tell you. Geese roasted on
> the spit fly to that abbey, God knows, and call “Geese, all hot! All
> hot!” They come with plentiful garlic, the best prepared that man may
> see. The lark, stewed and powdered with cloves and cinnamon, light
> down into man’s mouth. No one asks for drink but takes his fill
> freely.
>
> When the monks go to mass, all the glass windows turn into bright
> crystal to give the monks more light. When mass has been said and the
> books laid away, the crystal turns into glass as it was before. Each
> day after their meal, the young monks go out to play. No hawk or swift
> bird is better at flying in the sky than monks who are in high
> spirits, spreading their sleeves and hood. The abbot watches them fly
> with much amusement, but nevertheless calls them down for evensong.
> The monks will not alight but fly farther in a flurry. When the abbot
> sees them fleeing from him, he takes a maiden from the company and
> turns up her white buttocks and beats the little drums with his hand
> to make the monks land!
>
> When the monks see that, they fly down to the maiden, gather around
> her, and slap her white bottom. After their work, they wend home
> meekly to drink and go to their evening meal in a fair procession.
>
> There is another abbey nearby, a great fair nunnery up a river of
> sweet milk, where there is a great plenty of silk. When the summer day
> is hot, the young nuns take a boat and embark onto the river with oars
> and rudder. When they are far from the abbey, they make themselves
> naked in order to play and leap down into the water slyly to swim. The
> young monks who see them fly forth and soon come to the nuns. Each
> monk takes one and quickly bears his prey to the great grey abbey and
> teacher her a prayer with leg raised up and down. The monk that will
> be a good stallion and set his hood aright shall easily have twelve
> wives a year, through right and not through grace, to comfort himself.
> The one who does this best and prepares his body wholly for rest is
> hoped, God knows, soon to be father abbot.
>
> Whoever wants to come to that land must pay a heavy penance: he must
> wade in swine’s dung up to the chin for seven years to win the place.
> Gracious and good lords, may you never leave this world unless you
> find your fortune and fulfill that penance so that you may see that
> land. We pray to God that it may be. Amen, in the name of St Charity.
