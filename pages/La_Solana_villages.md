> To the east, in the Pyrenees of Aragon, the mountains of La Solana
> contain nearly twenty abandoned villages. As of this writing, seven of
> these villages have been reoccupied. The network between them is still
> in an informal stage, and many of the villages are only inhabited by a
> few people at an early point in the process of renovating them; but
> more people are moving there every year, and before long it could be a
> larger constellation of rural occupations than Itoiz. Many in these
> villages maintain strong connections to the squatters’ movement in
> Barcelona, and there is an open invitation for people to visit, help
> out, or even move there.
