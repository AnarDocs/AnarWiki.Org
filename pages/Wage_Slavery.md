# Wage Slavery

## Overview

**Wage slavery** is a term used to describe the condition where a
person's livelihood depends entirely on
<a href="Wage" class="wikilink" title="wages">wages</a> or a
<a href="Salary" class="wikilink" title="salary">salary</a>, especially
when wages are low, treatment and conditions are poor, and there are few
chances of upward mobility.[^1] The term emphasizes the unfree aspects
of <a href="Wage_Labor" class="wikilink" title="wage labour">wage
labour</a> and draws parallels between the subordination inherent in
employment relationships and the bondage of
<a href="Slavery" class="wikilink" title="chattel slavery">chattel
slavery</a>.

From an
<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
perspective, wage slavery represents a fundamental denial of human
freedom. As an English cotton worker described in 1818, masters ruled as
"despotic" over the "English Spinner slave."[^2] The anarchist critique
emphasizes that workers cannot escape the necessity of working for some
capitalist master in order to survive, making the notion of "free" wage
labor a contradiction in terms.

The situation is fundamentally involuntary because workers face a false
choice: accept employment under conditions set by employers, or face
poverty and starvation. This can be compared to an armed robbery where
the victim "chooses" to hand over their valuables - the choice is made
under duress, with death or destitution as the only alternative.[^3]

## Origins

### Ancient and Medieval Attitudes

The view that working for wages is akin to slavery dates back to the
ancient world.[^4] In ancient Rome,
<a href="Cicero" class="wikilink" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> wrote in *De
Officiis* that "the very wage \[wage labourers\] receive is a pledge of
their slavery," and that hired workmen were engaged in "vulgar trades"
because "in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their
slavery."[^5]

In 1763, the French journalist Simon Linguet published an influential
description of wage slavery, arguing that farm laborers were compelled
by want to "go down on their knees to the rich man in order to get from
him permission to enrich him." Linguet questioned whether such
conditions could truly be called freedom, since workers faced the most
"terrible, the most imperious of masters, that is, need."[^6]

### Development Under Capitalism

The transition from
<a href="Feudalism" class="wikilink" title="feudal">feudal</a> society
to
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
wage labor involved significant coercion. During the
<a href="Industrial_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, workers
struggled against the factory system, which required them to surrender
control over when and where they would work. New laws restricted the
ability of people to work on a temporary or casual basis, making
existence without "visible means of support" a crime as industrial
masters sought to discipline free peasants and artisans into docile
factory armies.[^7]

<a href="E.P._Thompson" class="wikilink" title="E.P. Thompson">E.P.
Thompson</a> argued that for British workers at the end of the 18th and
beginning of the 19th centuries, "the gap in status between a 'servant,'
a hired wage-laborer subject to the orders and discipline of the master,
and an artisan, who might 'come and go' as he pleased, was wide enough
for men to shed blood rather than allow themselves to be pushed from one
side to the other."[^8]

Research has shown that "the 'free-born Englishman' of the eighteenth
century – even those who, by force of circumstance, had to submit to
agricultural wage labour – tenaciously resisted entry into the
capitalist workshop."[^9]

## Anarchist Analysis

### The Illusion of Freedom

Anarchist thinkers have consistently argued that wage labor cannot be
considered truly free. <a href="Friedrich_Engels" class="wikilink"
title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> observed that while "the
proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly," creating an "appearance
of independence" through "a constant change in the person of the
individual employer," this freedom is illusory. The wage-laborer is
"bound to his owner by invisible threads," maintained by the "legal
fiction of a contract."[^10]

<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>
argued that the wage laborer, though not owned by any particular
capitalist, is effectively owned by the capitalist class: "He belongs
not to this or that bourgeois, but to the bourgeoisie, the bourgeois
class."[^11] In *Capital*, Marx went further, stating that "the worker
belongs to capital before he has sold himself to the capitalist."[^12]

### Similarities to Chattel Slavery

Critics of wage work have drawn several similarities between wage work
and slavery:

- While chattel slaves represented a capital investment their owners
  sought to protect, wage workers can be dismissed at any time, making
  them in some ways more disposable than slaves
- Both systems involve compulsion - slaves faced physical punishment for
  refusal to work, while wage workers face starvation
- The range of occupations historically held by both chattel slaves and
  wage workers has been similarly broad
- Both represent "specific response\[s\] to material and historical
  conditions" rather than immutable features of human nature[^13]

<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> denounced wage slavery by declaring: "The only difference is
that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves."[^14]

### Compulsion and Necessity

The French anarchist <a href="Louis-Auguste_Blanqui" class="wikilink"
title="Louis-Auguste Blanqui">Louis-Auguste Blanqui</a> emphasized that
servitude under capitalism means "being completely dispossessed of the
instruments of labour, and then being put at the mercy of those
privileged groups who usurped them." This creates a situation where
workers, though not slaves of any individual, "become absolutely
dependent on that caste, since their only remaining freedom is the
choice of which master will rule over them."[^15]

As <a href="Noam_Chomsky" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> has argued, "as long as individuals are compelled to rent
themselves on the market to those who are willing to hire them, as long
as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools, then
there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of
democracy very limited, if even meaningful."[^16]

### Work as Alienation

Work under capitalism is fundamentally alienating because it separates
workers from the products of their labor and subjects them to the
control of others. The activities workers engage in "are not based on
being useful to society or fulfilling to ourselves, but are based upon
getting money to have our needs met."[^17]

The commodification of labor transforms work from a purposeful and
meaningful activity into mere drudgery. Where work once involved
spiritual satisfaction in cooperating to meet needs, under capitalism
"the product \[is\] far more important than the producer." Workers cease
to have personal value in their toil, which "does not have a social
value to society."[^18]

### The Role of Debt

Anthropologist
<a href="David_Graeber" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
Graeber</a> has explored how debt historically functioned to transform
free people into wage laborers. Monetary debt, backed ultimately by the
threat of force, can dislodge people "from the webs of debt and mutual
responsibilities in which they're typically embedded," allowing labor to
be commodified.[^19]

In many historical contexts, debt peonage served as a transitional form
between slavery and wage labor. In Southeast Asia, for example, people
would sometimes "intentionally take out a loan so as to render
themselves dependent on some local grandee, who would then hire him out
and collect a share of the proceeds."[^20] This demonstrates how debt
creates the formal dependency relationships that make ongoing wage labor
socially acceptable.

## Psychological and Social Effects

### Stress and Insecurity

Modern wage labor produces significant psychological harm. A major 1999
study reported that 60% of employees claimed the pace of work and effort
required had greatly increased, resulting in poor general health and
tense family relationships. Job insecurity compounds this stress, with
workers told "if you want to keep your job, work harder" and "unless you
work harder, you will lose your job."[^21]

Investigative journalist
<a href="Robert_Kuttner" class="wikilink" title="Robert Kuttner">Robert
Kuttner</a> concluded from public health research that "to be in a life
situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which
one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health,
physically as well as mentally." Under wage labor, "epidemiological data
confirm that lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to
experience the most clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because
they have less control over their work."[^22]

### Degradation of Human Potential

As Bob Black argues in the anarchist critique of work, "You are what you
do. If you do boring, stupid, monotonous work, chances are you'll end up
boring, stupid, and monotonous." People who are "regimented all their
lives, handed to work from school and bracketed by the family in the
beginning and the nursing home in the end, are habituated to hierarchy
and psychologically enslaved."[^23]

<a href="Wilhelm_von_Humboldt" class="wikilink"
title="Wilhelm von Humboldt">Wilhelm von Humboldt</a> explained in 1791
that "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the
result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature;
he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with
mechanical exactness," and so when workers labor under external control,
"we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is."[^24]

## Historical Development

### The Lowell Mill Girls

The use of the term "wage slave" by labor organizations may originate
from the labor protests of the Lowell mill girls in 1836. These workers,
without any reported knowledge of European
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> or
anarchism, condemned the "degradation and subordination" of the
industrial system. They expressed their concerns in a protest song:

[^25]

Harriet Hanson Robinson wrote that "generously high wages were offered
to overcome the degrading nature of the work," because "in the eyes of
her overseer she was but a brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and
pushed about."[^26]

### Labor Movement Usage

The imagery of wage slavery was widely used by labor organizations
during the mid-19th century to object to the lack of
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>. A
"Member of the Builders' Union" in the 1830s argued that trade unions
"will not only strike for less work, and more wages, but will ultimately
abolish wages, become their own masters and work for each other; labor
and capital will no longer be separate but will be indissolubly joined
together in the hands of workmen and work-women."[^27]

According to historian Lawrence B. Glickman, in the 1870s through the
1890s, "references \[to wage slavery\] abounded in the labor press, and
it is hard to find a speech by a labor leader without the phrase."[^28]

However, the term gradually fell out of favor towards the end of the
19th century as labor organizations shifted their focus to raising wages
and adopted more pragmatic politics. The phrase "wage slavery" was
replaced by the more neutral term "wage work."[^29]

### Intensification and Commodification

Through processes like
<a href="Taylorism" class="wikilink" title="Taylorism">Taylorism</a> and
<a href="Fordism" class="wikilink" title="Fordism">Fordism</a>, work
became increasingly rationalized and controlled. "McDonaldisation" - the
breaking down of production into its smallest parts and systematically
re-engineering to maximize profit - creates "alienation from the
process, required to perform a series of meaningless tasks."[^30]

The intensification of work has continued into the present. Between 2000
and 2002 alone in Britain, the number of men working more than 60 hours
per week rose from one in eight to one in six, while the number of women
working long hours doubled.[^31] This intensification occurs alongside
increasing casualization and "flexibilization" that transfers risk from
employers to workers.

## Anarchist Alternatives

### Workers' Self-Management

Rather than seeking merely better wages or conditions within the wage
system, anarchists have historically advocated for
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>,
<a href="Worker_Cooperative" class="wikilink"
title="worker cooperatives">worker cooperatives</a>, and
<a href="Workers&#39;_Control" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a> as alternatives to
wage slavery.[^32]

The <a href="Grand_National_Consolidated_Trades_Union" class="wikilink"
title="Grand National Consolidated Trades Union">Grand National
Consolidated Trades Union</a> of 1834 had the "two-fold purpose of
syndicalist unions – the protection of the workers under the existing
system and the formation of the nuclei of the future society" when the
unions would "take over the whole industry of the country."[^33]

### Free Association and Voluntary Labor

In an anarchist society, work would be "a voluntary act, a personal
choice to work or not to work, to work now or later, to work hard or
slowly or carefully, with our hands or our minds or both." Because "the
meaning of work lies within the personal benefit to ourselves and the
social benefit to others, it must be freely chosen."[^34]

Rather than wage labor, production would be organized through
<a href="Free_Association_(Communism_and_Anarchism)" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a>, where people have
collectively managed access to the resources required to meet their
needs. Work would become "primarily, the expression of a person's
pleasure in what they are doing and become like an art — an expression
of their creativity and individuality."[^35]

### Refusal of Work

The struggle against work is "the struggle to have our needs met on our
own terms." While individual resistance can sometimes lead to small
victories, "the strongest concessions won in the past have always
happened when the working class has taken collective
<a href="Direct_Action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>."[^36]

This includes various forms of workplace resistance such as
<a href="Strike_Action" class="wikilink" title="strikes">strikes</a>,
<a href="Sabotage" class="wikilink" title="sabotage">sabotage</a>, work
stoppages,
<a href="Go_Slow" class="wikilink" title="go-slows">go-slows</a>, and
<a href="Work_to_Rule" class="wikilink"
title="work-to-rule">work-to-rule</a> actions. The ultimate aim is "the
refusal of work by all working people, for all time" - a general strike
that would destroy the means by which capitalism compels people to
work.[^37]

## Criticism

Some defenders of capitalism argue that wage labor represents a mutually
beneficial exchange and that workers are free to choose between
employers.
<a href="Robert_Nozick" class="wikilink" title="Robert Nozick">Robert
Nozick</a> and other right-libertarians have argued that a truly free
society would even allow voluntary enslavement contracts, rejecting the
notion of inalienable rights.[^38]

Some abolitionists in the United States regarded the analogy of wage
workers as wage slaves to be spurious, arguing that wage workers were
"neither wronged nor oppressed."[^39]
<a href="Abraham_Lincoln" class="wikilink"
title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and the Republicans argued
that the condition was different from slavery as long as laborers had
the opportunity to eventually work for themselves and achieve
self-employment.[^40]

However, anarchists respond that the supposed freedom to choose between
employers is illusory when the alternative is destitution, and that the
opportunity for self-employment has steadily diminished under
capitalism. As <a href="Frederick_Douglass" class="wikilink"
title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> concluded later in
life, "experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only
a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery,
and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other."[^41]
