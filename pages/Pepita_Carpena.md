**Josefa Carpena Amat** (19 December 1919 – 5 June 2005), known by the
pseudonym **Pepita Carpena**, was a
"<a   href="Catalonia.md" class="wikilink" title="Catalan">Catalan</a>
"<a   href="trade_union.md" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
unionist</a> and "<a   href="anarcha-feminism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist feminist">anarchist feminist</a> activist who played a
significant role in the
"<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a> and
the
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a> movement.

## Family

Pepita Carpena was born into a
"<a   href="working_class.md" class="wikilink" title="working class">working
class</a> family in the workers' quarter of Pueblo Seco in
"<a   href="Barcelona.md" class="wikilink" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>.
She was one of six children, two of whom died in infancy.[^1] Her father
was a member of the "<a   href="CNT.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalist">anarcho-syndicalist</a> trade union, the
*"<a   href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a>* (CNT), which influenced her early political
development.[^2]

## Early Life

At the age of 11, following the proclamation of the
"<a   href="Second_Spanish_Republic.md" class="wikilink"
title="Second Spanish Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, Carpena
left school and entered the workforce.[^3] She was first introduced to
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a> in
1933 at the age of 14, when she attended a number of
"<a   href="Libertarian_Youth.md" class="wikilink"
title="Libertarian Youth">Libertarian Youth</a> (FIJL) events designed
to attract young members into the
"<a   href="anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish anarchist movement">Spanish anarchist movement</a>.[^4]
Through these events, she participated in
"<a   href="book_discussion_club.md" class="wikilink"
title="book discussion club">book discussion clubs</a> focused on works
by authors including Balzac, Zola, Rousseau, as well as anarchist
classics by "<a   href="Anselmo_Lorenzo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anselmo Lorenzo">Anselmo Lorenzo</a> and
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>. She described these
discussions as providing her with a
"<a   href="dialogic.md" class="wikilink" title="dialogic">dialogic</a>
education.[^5]

Carpena became a young member of the metalworkers' union of the CNT,
which initially worried her parents. However, after she took her father
to a meeting, he approved of her involvement in the workers'
organisation.[^6] When she went to work as a
"<a   href="seamstress.md" class="wikilink" title="seamstress">seamstress</a>,
her union encouraged her to organize other women in her workplace. Her
employer dismissed her for her trade union activism, but the
metalworkers' union intervened and secured her reinstatement.[^7] Over
the subsequent years, she continued organizing with the CNT and the
FIJL, building skills and connections that would prove crucial during
the revolutionary period.

## Adulthood

### Spanish Revolution and Civil War

When the "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>
erupted in July, Carpena was only 16 years old. She later described the
revolution as having a transformative effect on her consciousness.[^8]
At 16, she was eager to join the anarchist
"<a   href="Durruti_Column.md" class="wikilink" title="Durruti Column">Durruti
Column</a> to fight at the front, but
"<a   href="Buenaventura_Durruti.md" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a> himself told her
that she would be more useful working at the rear.[^9]

When her partner was killed fighting in the
"<a   href="Spanish_Civil_War.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, she received his salary
as a "<a   href="stipend.md" class="wikilink" title="stipend">stipend</a> to
continue organizing working women.[^10] She began working in a factory
manufacturing grenades for the front while continuing her political
activism.[^11]

### Experiences with Male Chauvinism and Joining Mujeres Libres

Initially, Carpena refused to join the anarchist women's organization
"<a   href="Mujeres_Libres.md" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a>, believing there was no need for separation between men and
women in the anarchist movement.[^12] However, she became increasingly
disillusioned with the
"<a   href="Chauvinism#Male_chauvinism.md" class="wikilink"
title="chauvinism">chauvinism</a> expressed by some of her male comrades
in the FIJL.[^13]

On one notable occasion, a male FIJL member confronted her about her
views on "<a   href="women&#39;s_liberation.md" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s liberation">women's liberation</a>, insisting that
she was not truly liberated because she refused his
"<a   href="Sexual_harassment.md" class="wikilink"
title="unwanted sexual advances">unwanted sexual advances</a>. She
responded that, as a liberated woman, she could decide who she slept
with and that he did not interest her.[^14] She reported that such
scenarios occurred regularly with male counterparts, and that it was
even worse with men outside the anarchist movement. Through these
experiences, she came to understand the necessity of a specific women's
organization, and in April 1937 she joined Mujeres Libres.[^15]

Later that year, the FIJL established its own women's bureau. Carpena
opposed this "counterproductive" decision, believing it threatened to
negate the work which Mujeres Libres had already accomplished, and left
the FIJL to continue her work with Mujeres Libres.[^16] Many other young
activists shared her concerns, worrying that the FIJL would drain
resources by duplicating Mujeres Libres' efforts.

### Feminist Organizing and Education

Together with other new members such as
"<a   href="Conchita_Guillén.md" class="wikilink"
title="Conchita Guillén">Conchita Guillén</a> and
"<a   href="Amada_de_Nó.md" class="wikilink" title="Amada de Nó">Amada de
Nó</a>, Carpena studied "<a   href="anarcha-feminism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist feminist">anarchist feminist</a> ideas on
"<a   href="gender_equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="gender equality">gender equality</a> and
"<a   href="women&#39;s_empowerment.md" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s empowerment">women's empowerment</a> under the
tutelage of "<a   href="Mercè_Comaposada.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mercè Comaposada">Mercè Comaposada</a>, who sought to teach them
new conceptions of womanhood.[^17]

After completing her education with Comaposada, Carpena participated in
numerous "propaganda tours" organized by the Catalan branch of Mujeres
Libres.[^18] She became the Propaganda Secretary of the Catalan Regional
Committee of Mujeres Libres.[^19] In towns throughout
"<a   href="Revolutionary_Catalonia.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, Carpena would call local women to
meetings and explain feminist principles to them. Some of these women
had never before encountered ideas of gender equality and women's
empowerment.[^20]

Carpena emphasized that their educational efforts were based in dialogue
and understanding rather than intellectual superiority. She discovered
that many women already desired freedom from
"<a   href="machismo.md" class="wikilink" title="machismo">machismo</a>,
recognizing that they were dominated through force rather than their own
willing
"<a   href="submission.md" class="wikilink" title="submission">submission</a>.[^21]
As she later reflected: "They wanted to finish with the machoist
traditions. Even those who did not have the habit of struggle had well
defined ideas and knew what they wanted."[^22]

Carpena also appealed to
"<a   href="sex_worker.md" class="wikilink" title="sex worker">sex workers</a>
to quit their work and join the feminist movement, successfully
convincing at least one to attend her classes and eventually join her
"<a   href="Cadre_(politics).md" class="wikilink" title="cadre">cadre</a> of
Mujeres Libres.[^23] The organization taught women about
"<a   href="human_female_sexuality.md" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s sexuality">women's sexuality</a>, though Carpena
noted that Mujeres Libres did not focus on
"<a   href="sexual_orientation.md" class="wikilink"
title="sexual orientation">sexual orientation</a>, as they believed this
was not a political issue.[^24]

Together with
"<a   href="Sara_Berenguer.md" class="wikilink" title="Sara Berenguer">Sara
Berenguer</a> and Conchita Guillén, Carpena visited soldiers on the
front lines of the civil war on trips organized by
"<a   href="Solidaridad_Internacional_Antifascista.md" class="wikilink"
title="Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista">Solidaridad Internacional
Antifascista</a>.[^25] With "<a   href="Soledad_Estorach.md" class="wikilink"
title="Soledad Estorach">Soledad Estorach</a>, she organized
agricultural collectives throughout Catalonia and
"<a   href="Regional_Defence_Council_of_Aragon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Aragon">Aragon</a>.[^26]

### Exile in France

In January 1939, as the
"<a   href="Nationalist_faction_(Spanish_Civil_War).md" class="wikilink"
title="Nationalist">Nationalist</a>
"<a   href="Catalonia_Offensive.md" class="wikilink"
title="Catalonia Offensive">Catalonia Offensive</a> closed in on
Barcelona, Carpena and other Mujeres Libres activists began organizing
their evacuation. They destroyed all of the organization's documents to
prevent them from falling into enemy hands and arranged for a truck to
pick them up at 05:00 on 25 January 1939. When their truck failed to
arrive—the driver had panicked and fled north alone—Carpena went to the
Mujeres Libres offices and found another vehicle. The activists left the
city only hours before the Nationalists entered.[^27]

Carpena went into exile in France, settling in
"<a   href="Marseille.md" class="wikilink" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>.[^28]
There she met the Russian anarchist
"<a   href="Voline.md" class="wikilink" title="Voline">Voline</a>, then living
in semi-clandestinity. She later marveled at making the acquaintance of
"this veteran of the Russian Revolution."[^29] With the end of World War
II, she actively participated in the reconstruction of the CNT and the
FIJL in exile, vigorously opposing reformist tendencies within the
CNT.[^30]

One of her close friends, Raul Carballeira, returned to Spain to carry
out underground work against the Franco regime. He was killed by
Francoist police in the Jardin de Montjuich in Barcelona in 1945, shot
full of holes.[^31]

### Work with CIRA

Carpena became an
"<a   href="archivist.md" class="wikilink" title="archivist">archivist</a> for
the "<a   href="Centre_International_de_Recherches_sur_l&#39;Anarchisme.md"
class="wikilink"
title="International Center for Research on Anarchism">International
Center for Research on Anarchism</a> (CIRA) in
"<a   href="Marseille.md" class="wikilink" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>,
participating in its activities from 1979.[^32] She served as
coordinator of CIRA-Marseilles from 1988 to 1999, welcoming visitors to
the library and managing the Spanish language archives.[^33]

She traveled throughout Europe speaking about the Spanish Revolution and
her experiences with Mujeres Libres.[^34] She participated in many
lectures and debates organized by CIRA, contributing to its bulletin on
numerous occasions.[^35] She wrote extensively for the French and
Spanish anarchist press, including publications such as *Cenit*, *CNT*,
*Le Combat Syndicaliste*, *Ideas-Orto*, and *Solidaridad Obrera*.[^36]

### Personal Life

Throughout her life, Carpena maintained her commitment to feminist
principles and gender equality. She reflected in later years: "I became
aware of the sexist injustices in daily life because these were suffered
by all women. Today like yesterday, I have the same opinions: despite
the evolution of morality, there have hardly been any changes. If by the
force of things, couples work, the man occupies himself a bit more with
the home and his children, that is the minimum and my intimate
conviction is that the two human beings, the man and the woman, must
have the same rights and the same freedom."[^37]

Historian "<a   href="Martha_Ackelsberg.md" class="wikilink"
title="Martha Ackelsberg">Martha Ackelsberg</a> interviewed Carpena
about Mujeres Libres in Montpellier in December 1981 and in Barcelona in
May 1988. Carpena became a key
"<a   href="primary_source.md" class="wikilink" title="primary source">primary
source</a> for Ackelsberg's influential book *Free Women of Spain*.[^38]

## Death

Pepita Carpena died in Marseille on 5 June 2005.[^39] She was cremated
at Aix-en-Provence on 8 June 2005.[^40]

## Bibliography

Between April 1992 and June 1993, Pepita Carpena drafted her memoirs in
Spanish under the title *De toda la vida* (literally "Of All Life" or "A
Whole Life"). The text was distributed as photocopies in 1998 and
published as a 72-page pamphlet by Éditions du Monde libertaire and
Alternative Libertaire (Brussels) in 2000 as part of the Graine d'ananar
series.[^41]

She contributed to two important anthologies:

- In *Mujeres libres: luchadoras libertarias* (Fundación Anselmo
  Lorenzo, 1999), she contributed two pieces: "Vivencias" (Experiences)
  and "Solidaridad fraterna" (Sisterly Solidarity). The book was
  translated into French as *Mujeres libres: des femmes libertaires en
  lutte* (Los-las Solidarios-solidarias, 2000).[^42]
- She participated in the debate on Feminism & Post-Feminism in the
  symposium proceedings *Anarquisme: exposició internacional* (Fundació
  d'Estudis llibertaris i anarco-sindicalistes, 1994).[^43]

Her testimony appears in two CIRA Marseilles bulletins:

- *1886:1936 et quelques autres anniversaires* (No 26-27, 1986)
- *Les anarchistes espagnols dans la tourmente (1939-1945)* (No 29-30,
  1989)[^44]

Pepita Carpena features prominently in two films about the Spanish
Revolution:

- Richard Prost's *Un autre futur* (Another Future, 1988-1997)
- *De toda la vida* by Lisa Berger and Carol Mazer (1986)[^45]

Her photograph also appears in Erick Zonka's film *Le petit voleur* (The
Little Thief, 1999).[^46]
