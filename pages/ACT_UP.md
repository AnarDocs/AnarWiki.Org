Founded in New York in 1987, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
<a href="Wikipedia:ACT_UP" class="wikilink" title="(ACT UP)">(ACT
UP)</a> is a direct action network that seeks to end the AIDS crisis.
ACT UP's strategy during their heyday involved: "nonviolent civil
disobedience, inside-outside strategic positioning (protesting and
causing ruckus while also having people work within power structures), a
single-issue focus, and research-and-information-driven citizen lobbying
efforts"[^1]

In the 1980s and 1990s, [ACT UP](https://actupny.com/) successfully
pushed companies and government agencies to accelerate the release of
effective AIDS treatment. The group employed an “inside-outside
approach” combining intense pressure and tactical collaboration.[^2]

ACT UP member Peter Staley credits the group with making possible the
release of life-saving “triple drug therapy”:

> Triple drug therapy in 1996 saved my life. And those therapies came
> about because the government spent a billion dollars on research,
> starting in 1989, 1990. And that all came about because of pressure
> from advocacy. So I’m alive because of that activism.[^3]

According to *New York Magazine*, “ACT UP revolutionized everything from
the way drugs are researched to the way doctors interact with patients.
Ultimately it played a key role in catalyzing the development of the
drugs that since 1996 have helped keep patients alive for a near-normal
life span.”[^4]

Although the group was disportionately white and cis-male, there were
also influential people of color such as Katrina Haslip and Ray
Navarro[^5] and transgender campaigners such as Miss Major
Griffin-Gracy.[^6]

ACT UP influenced many radical queer groups such as FIERCE. ACT UP
continues to organize today, and their website is
<https://actupny.org/>.

# Structure

Within a local ACT UP chapter, people organized into project-based
committees including an Action Committee, a Finance Committee, and a
Treatment and Data Committee. Many people also organized affinity groups
within these committees.[^7]

The pamphlet *Anarchism and AIDS Activism* reported, "ACT UP and similar
AIDS direct action groups follow an anarchist model in many ways,
although their overall attitude toward the state was ambiguous."[^8] ACT
UP had "no formal leadership, either within or among chapters," and was
"\[d\]irect-action oriented."[^9]

ACT UP founder Larry Kramer contrasted the group's horizontal structure
with the vertical orientation of the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC),
which he had previously co-founded:

> \[In GMHC, e\]verything had to have a job description and approval by
> this, and approval by that. And I didn’t want that. So we went the
> other way. I often describe it as democratic to a fault. And when
> people came and said, we want to start this, or we want to start that
> – fine. Because I remember – GHMC, when I tried to get different
> groups started, different people who came and said, I can do
> epidemiology, I can do – it was forever until we could get a lawyer in
> there and do legal services. People came to ACT UP and said, we want
> to start – there was – we were allowed to do it.[^10]

Kramer argues that ACT UP began to decline once the technically-minded
people in the Treatment and Data Committee, who were typically the
members who negotiated with scientists and government bureaucrats, left
the group and started a moderate nonprofit organization called Treatment
Action Group (TAG):

> They were drunk on their power. They could sit down with the head of
> Bristol-Myers or the chief scientists. They could call all these
> people up and they could do it on their own from then on, and they
> didn’t need anyone fighting on the outside for them. And perhaps they
> became a little ashamed of us, I don’t know. But I will never forgive
> them for it.[^11]

# Actions

On 14 September 1989, ACT UP infiltrated the New York Stock Exchange and
chained themselves to a balcony. They unfurled a banner criticizing the
company Burroughs Wellcome’s obscene prices for the AIDS medication
known as AZT. Four days later, the company lowered AZT’s price by twenty
percent.[^12]

On 10 December 1989, ACT UP and Women’s Health Action and Mobilization
(WHAM!) brought 4,500 to 7,000 protesters outside New York’s St. Patrick
Cathedral, in protest of the Catholic Church’s anti-contraception,
heterosexist, and anti-abortion policies. Dozens entered the church and
loudly disrupted the mass with shouts, chants, and whistles. Overall,
111 people were arrested. The action sparked public debate about the
Church’s conservative positions.[^13]

In 1991, ACT UP inflated a giant condom, nearly thirty-five feet high,
over the entire house of the homophobic Senator Jesse Helms in
Arlington, Virginia.[^14]

In 1992, ACT UP members including Bob Rafsky heckled the candidate and
future president Bill Clinton, bringing the AIDS issue to the center of
the election cycle.[^15]

By the early 2000s, ACT UP chapters had largely shifted focus away from
middle-class, white gay and lesbian activists and toward projects
relevant to queer folks in poor communities of color, locally and
globally. ‘’The Nation’’ summarized:

> This is particularly true for ACT UP Philadelphia, half of whose
> current members are people of color and people with AIDS. ACT UP
> Philadelphia rarely does outreach to traditional gay and lesbian
> communities, instead using teach-ins at drug treatment clinics,
> housing organizations and needle exchange programs. Its tactics still
> draw from a queer consciousness, and many of its members are queer,
> but they’re also from minority and low-income communities\[…\]
>
> Both ACT UP Philadelphia and ACT UP New York are part of the Health
> GAP Coalition, a network of AIDS and trade activists formed in 1999
> when its members realized that no organization existed within the
> United States focusing exclusively on the global AIDS epidemic. Health
> GAP’s first direct actions included a disruption of the Gore campaign
> kickoff in Carthage, Tennessee, to protest Gore’s position against
> compulsory licensing and his threats of trade sanctions against South
> Africa. Within a month, Gore shifted his stance, endorsing the use of
> compulsory licensing and parallel imports of drugs to South
> Africa.[^16]
