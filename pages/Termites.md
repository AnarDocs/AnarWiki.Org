Termites self-organize horizontally in a process biologist Pierre-Paul
Grasse termed stigmergy, as Kevin Carson explains:

> "'Stigmergy' is a term coined by biologist Pierre-Paul Grasse in the
> 1950s to describe the process by which termites coordinate their
> activity. Social insects like termites and ants coordinate their
> efforts through the independent responses of individuals to
> environmental triggers like chemical markers, without any need for a
> central coordinating authority."[^1]

Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers describe the termite nest
construction as an example of order emerging out of chaos:

> The first stage in this activity, the construction of the base, has
> been shown by Grasé to be the result of what appears to be disordered
> behavior among termites. At this stage, they transport and drop lumps
> of earth in a random fashion, but in doing so they impregnate the
> lumps with a hormone that attracts other termites. The situation could
> thus be represented as follows: the initial 'fluctuation' would be the
> slightly larger concentration of lumps of earth, which inevitably
> occurs at one time or another at some point in the area. The
> amplification of this event is produced by the increased density of
> termites in the region, attracted by the slightly higher hormone
> concentration. As termites become more numerous in a region, the
> probability of their dropping lumps of earth there increases, leading
> in turn to a still higher concentration of the hormone. In this way
> 'pillars' are formed, separated by a distance related to the range
> over which the hormone spreads."[^2]

An experiment summarized by Erich Jantsch displays termites' ability to
creatively adapt to new circumstances:

> The Austrian Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch (1974) reports in his
> wonderful book Animal Architecture the case of a termite nest which
> has been covered by a plastic tent, resulting in diminished
> ventilation. Within 48 hours, the animals had developed additional
> structures of a novel design which restored the old ventilation rate
> under the changed conditions.[^3]

Marxist geographer David Harvey likens anarchist strategy to termite
behavior. He critiques this strategy as ineffective or at least
insufficient. Harvey's metaphor arguably overlooks that termites build
structures as well as destroying them, and that termites can be quite
resilient to extermination.

> The assumption is that the oppressive power of the state can be
> "withered away" as oppositional movements of various sorts-factory
> occupations, solidarity economies, collective autonomous movements,
> agrarian cooperatives, and the like-gather momentum within civil
> society. This amounts to what one might call a "termite theory" of
> revolutionary change: eating away at the institutional and material
> supports of capital until they collapse. This is not a dismissive
> term. Termites can inflict terrible damage, often hidden from easy
> detection. The problem is not lack of potential effectiveness; it is
> that, as soon as the damage wrought becomes too obvious and
> threatening, then capital is both able and all too willing to call in
> the exterminators (state powers) to deal with it. The only hope then
> is that the exterminators will either turn upon their masters (as they
> have sometimes done in the past) or be defeated-a rather unlikely
> outcome except in particular circumstances such as those in
> Afghanistan-in the course of a militarized struggle. There is, alas,
> no guarantee that the form of society that will then emerge will be
> less barbaric than that which it replaces.[^4]
