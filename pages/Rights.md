# Rights

From an anarchist perspective, the concept of "legal rights" (dependent
upon civil law) represents one of the most dangerous myths perpetuated
by state power. While commonly understood as protections for individual
freedom, anarchists argue that the concept of governments granting
rights is actually a way for authority to control people while making
them think they're being protected.

## The Myth of Human Rights

### Natural vs Legal Rights

Rights are typically divided into two categories:

**Legal Rights** (also called civil rights or statutory rights) are
privileges granted by the state to certain segments of the population.
These depend entirely on the rule of law within a nation and can be
revoked at any time by those in power.

**Natural Rights** (also called human rights, moral rights, or
inalienable rights) are claimed to be fundamental to human existence,
supposedly granted by nature or divine authority, and theoretically
universal and eternal.

Both categories, however, are revealed through anarchist analysis to be
constructs serving state power rather than genuine protections for human
freedom.

Some anarchists and radicals have attempted to reclaim the language of
"rights" to describe basic human needs, dignity, and freedoms - what
people actually require to live full lives such as food, shelter,
autonomy, community, and freedom from domination. However, most
anarchist thinkers argue that using rights language, even for these
genuine human needs, ultimately legitimizes the authority structures
that grant or deny such "rights" in the first place. They advocate
instead for direct fulfillment of human needs through mutual aid and
voluntary cooperation, without appealing to any authority for
permission.

### Rights as State Privileges

As "<a   href="George_Carlin.md" class="wikilink" title="George Carlin">"George
Carlin</a> observed, rights function as "a bill of temporary privileges"
that can be withdrawn whenever convenient for those in power. The
"<a   href="Japanese_American_internment.md" class="wikilink"
title="Japanese American internment">"Japanese American internment</a>
during World War II exemplifies this perfectly - 110,000 law-abiding
citizens were stripped of all their supposed constitutional rights and
imprisoned simply because their ancestry was deemed threatening. Their
only remaining "right" was "right this way" into the camps.[^1]

"<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">"Voltairine de Cleyre</a> articulated the
fundamental distinction: "Note the difference between a right and a
privilege. A right, in the abstract, is a fact; it is not a thing to be
given, established, or conferred; it is. Of the exercise of a right
power may deprive me; of the right itself, never. Privilege, in the
abstract, does not exist; there is no such thing. Rights actually
recognized, privilege is destroyed. But, in the practical, the moment
you admit a supreme authority, you have denied rights. Practically the
supremacy has all the rights, and no matter what the human race
possesses, it does so merely at the caprice of that authority."[^2]

## The Function of Rights Discourse

### Legitimizing Authority

Rights discourse serves multiple functions for state power:

- **Creating artificial scarcity** - By first stripping away all
  freedoms, then parceling back select privileges, the state creates
  dependency and gratitude for what should be natural
- **Dividing populations** - Rights create hierarchies between those who
  have them and those who don't (citizens vs. migrants, law-abiding vs.
  criminals, etc.)
- **Channeling resistance** - Social movements are co-opted into
  demanding rights from authority rather than rejecting authority
  entirely
- **Masking structural violence** - The illusion of protection obscures
  the reality that the state maintains power through violence

### State Overcoding

Drawing on the work of philosophers
"<a   href="Gilles_Deleuze.md" class="wikilink" title="Gilles Deleuze">"Gilles
Deleuze</a> and
"<a   href="Félix_Guattari.md" class="wikilink" title="Félix Guattari">"Félix
Guattari</a>, anarchist theorist
"<a   href="Aragorn_Eloff.md" class="wikilink" title="Aragorn Eloff">"Aragorn
Eloff</a> argues that rights operate as part of "State overcoding" - "a
reification of these arrangements of coded institutions and practices,
as well as various material flows, that allows them to resonate
together". Rights discourse creates "a rigid segmentarity" that divides
human experience into legally manageable categories while establishing
the state as the sole legitimate arbiter of what people deserve.[^3]

## The Impossibility of Universal Rights

### Cultural and Historical Relativity

"<a   href="Bob_Black.md" class="wikilink" title="Bob Black">"Bob Black</a>
demonstrates that "belief in human rights is far from universal" and
that moral systems vary dramatically across cultures and historical
periods. What one society considers a fundamental right, another may
view as abhorrent. The supposedly universal "right to life" coexists
with capital punishment, war, and systematic state violence in virtually
every society that proclaims it.[^4]

As "<a   href="Blaise_Pascal.md" class="wikilink" title="Blaise Pascal">"Blaise
Pascal</a> observed in the 17th century: "Larceny, incest, parricide,
everything has at some time been accounted a virtuous action."[^5]

### The Absence of Objective Foundation

Natural rights proponents claim these rights derive from:

- **Human nature** - But human nature varies and cannot be objectively
  defined
- **Divine command** - But this requires belief in deities and faces the
  "<a   href="Euthyphro_dilemma.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Euthyphro dilemma">"Euthyphro dilemma</a>
- **Self-evidence** - But what seems self-evident to some is rejected by
  others
- **Human dignity** - But conceptions of dignity are culturally relative

"<a   href="J.L._Mackie.md" class="wikilink" title="J.L. Mackie">"J.L.
Mackie</a> argued that "If there were objective values, then they would
be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly
different from anything else in the universe."[^6]

## Rights vs. Freedom

### The Authoritarian Nature of Rights

Rights discourse is inherently authoritarian because:

- **Rights require enforcers** - Someone must have the power to grant,
  interpret, and protect rights
- **Rights create duties** - Every right in one person creates
  obligations in others
- **Rights strengthen the state** - Enforcement requires expanding state
  power and legitimacy
- **Rights are adversarial** - They create win/lose conflicts rather
  than cooperative solutions

As "<a   href="Mary_Ann_Glendon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mary Ann Glendon">"Mary Ann Glendon</a> noted: "Our rights talk,
in its absoluteness, promotes unrealistic expectations, heightens social
conflict, and inhibits social dialogue that might lead toward consensus,
accommodation, or at least the discovery of common ground."[^7]

### Rights vs. Desires and Needs

Rather than demanding rights from authority, anarchists advocate for
directly fulfilling human desires and needs through mutual aid and
voluntary cooperation. As Bob Black suggests: "Don't claim that your
rights be respected. Demand that your interests be served. Better yet,
if you can, serve them yourself."[^8]

## Anarchist Alternatives

### Beyond Rights Discourse

"<a   href="Proudhon.md" class="wikilink" title="Proudhon">"Proudhon</a>
defined right as "the recognition of human dignity in all its faculties,
attributes and prerogatives" - but crucially, this recognition emerges
from social relationships rather than state authority.[^9]

While rejecting the language of rights, anarchists still recognize that
people have genuine needs, deserve dignity, and should be free from
domination. Rather than framing these as "rights" to be granted by
authority, anarchists speak of:

- **Human needs** - Basic requirements like food, shelter, healthcare,
  and community that should be met through cooperation
- **Personal autonomy** - The freedom to make choices about one's own
  life without interference from rulers
- **Dignity** - The inherent worth of every person that emerges from
  mutual recognition, not legal declarations
- **Freedom** - The absence of domination and coercion, achieved through
  dismantling hierarchies rather than appealing to them

The key difference is that anarchists seek to fulfill these directly
through voluntary cooperation rather than asking permission from
authority.

Anarchists propose several alternatives to rights-based thinking:

- **Mutual Aid** - Voluntary cooperation to meet human needs without
  coercion
- **Direct Action** - Taking action to solve problems rather than
  petitioning authority
- **Voluntary Association** - Free association based on consent rather
  than legal obligation
- **Autonomous Communities** - Self-governing groups that handle
  conflicts through restorative rather than punitive justice

### Freedom Through Anarchy

True freedom cannot come from rights granted by authority, but only
through the elimination of authority itself. As
"<a   href="Pëtr_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Pëtr Kropotkin">"Pëtr
Kropotkin</a> observed: "This is what these so-called liberties can be
reduced to. Freedom of press and of meeting, inviolability of home and
all the rest, are only respected if the people do not make use of them
against the privileged classes. But the day the people begin to take
advantage of them to undermine those privileges, the so-called liberties
will be cast overboard."[^10]

Anarchists seek not the expansion of rights, but their transcendence
through the creation of societies based on voluntary cooperation, mutual
aid, and the free development of human potential without hierarchical
constraint.
