### Notes

- While anarchism has not achieved communism, there are some societies
  that resemble socialism, such as Zapatista-controlled Chiapas, Rojava
  in Syria, and Marinaleda in Spain. Moreover, these autonomous areas
  have lasted 26, 7, and ~29 years respectively.
- Socialism/communism are by definition stateless. When statists make
  critiques of anarchism, this can also be applied to
  socialism/communism, too. One can point out that the state is actually
  anti-communist, since communism is stateless.
