anarchists being arrested. Pantaleimon tried to find other anarchists in
1927 across Ukraine, and met Belochub and Avraam Budanov, who were
highly suspicious of him. But they agreed and distributed anarchist
pamphlets to workers and peasants in Ukraine, being arrested for it in
1928, and Pantaleimon was executed by firing squad in 1929.[^1]
