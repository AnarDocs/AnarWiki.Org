sympathised with the

in "<a   href="February_Revolution_(Russia).md" class="wikilink"

"<a   href="Black_Army_(Ukraine).md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Army of Ukraine">"Black Army of Ukraine</a> in 1919 and
commanded a horse artillery unit. He helped defeated Red Army units at
the battle of Stepovaya, and was arrested by the
"<a   href="Kontrrazvedka.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kontrrazvedka">"Kontrrazvedka</a> for conspiracy to assasinate
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Makhno">"Makhno</a> but
was later released. He helped defeat the White Army at the battle of
Wrangel in 1920 and deserted the Makhnovists in February 1921, giving
himself up to the Bolsheviks for amnesty.

He returned to his native village and worked as a farmer and became
chair of the village council. He was invited to the underground Nabat
conference in Kharkov, but it was sabotaged by an unknown person
("<a   href="Viktor_Belash.md" class="wikilink" title="Viktor Belash">"Viktor
Belash</a> is suspected) and turned into the Cheka, leading to 70
anarchists being arrested. Pantaleimon tried to find other anarchists in
1927 across Ukraine, and met Belochub and Avraam Budanov, who were
highly suspicious of him. But they agreed and distributed anarchist
pamphlets to workers and peasants in Ukraine, being arrested for it in
1928, and Pantaleimon was executed by firing squad in 1929.[^1]
