Within the human body, trillions of cells essentially confederate into
autonomous communities that engage in mutual aid with each other and
with organisms such as bacteria and mites. Without any overarching boss,
body parts spontaneously maintain and self-replicate themselves,
maintaining a functioning human body.

Authoritarians have often used the human body as a metaphor for a
tyrannical society, with the head representing the ruler and the other
parts representing subjects. This analogy vastly overestimates the
brain's role and overlooks the decentralization that actually underlies
a body's daily functioning. Even within the brain, one finds
decentralization and spontaneity rather than any kind of top-down,
centrally planned order.

## Organs and Self-Organization

Collections of cells, the organs of the human body maintain and
replicate their own structure on a regular basis. Fritjof Capra
elaborates, "Thus the pancreas replaces most of its cells every
twenty-four hours, the stomach lining every three days; our white blood
cells are renewed in ten days and 98 percent of the protein in the brain
is turned over in less than one month. All these processes are regulated
in such a way that the overall pattern of the organism is preserved, and
this remarkable ability of self-maintenance persists under a variety of
circumstances, including changing environmental conditions and many
kinds of interference."[^1]

# Decentralization in the human brain

The human brain is remarkably decentralized, involving horizontal
coordination between different parts. Colin Ward writes in

Social theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri write:

# Symbiotic relationships

Biologists Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan explain that human beings "are
really walking assemblages, beings who have integrated various other
kinds of organisms—that each of us is a sort of loose committee."[^3]
The human body has three bacteria cells for every human cell.[^4] Here
are some of the organisms with which the human body has a symbiotic
relationship:

> - underarm bacteria
> - intestinal bacteria
> - spirochetes in our gums
> - bacteria and fungi between our toes[^5]

Through horizontal gene transfer, genes from bacteria and viruses have
entered into human cells. Some 8 percent of the human genome originated
from viruses. For example, the genes responsible for the human placenta
came from a retrovirus invasion into the human genome.[^6]
