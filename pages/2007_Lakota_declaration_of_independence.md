> Lakota resistance never ended, and they may win their war in the end.
> In December 2007, a group of Lakota again asserted their independence,
> informing the US State Department that they were withdrawing from all
> treaties, which had already been broken by the settler government, and
> seceding, as a necessary measure in the face of “colonial apartheid
> conditions.”
