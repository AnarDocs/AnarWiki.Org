The Bénard convection is a chemical reaction that's an example of
self-organizing order emerging far from equilibrium. When certain
liquids, including silicone oil[^1], are uniformly heated from below, an
orderly honeycomb-like pattern of hexagons emerges.

In Brussels in the 1960s, the chemist Ilya Prigogine closely examined
Henri Bénard's discovery that heating a liquid from below creates a kind
of heat convection (meaning a transfer of heat) to the liquid's center,
at which point the honeycomb pattern emerges. The convection also occurs
in nonhuman nature. Heat flowing from the land into sky creates
hexagonal patterns in desert sand dunes and Arctic ice fields.[^2]
