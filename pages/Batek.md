The Batek are an egalitarian, immediate-return foraging society in
Malaysia.[^1] Anthropologist Ivan Tacey reports:

> "In Batek life, personal autonomy is highly valued but alongside
> mutual sharing. So, it's egalitarianism, gender egalitarianism,
> there's no chiefs, men are not more powerful than women, there's no
> corporate groups, there's no age sets. People are equal. You can't
> even boss your children around \[...\] They are very much anarchists
> in the way they have these high, high, high levels of individual
> autonomy (which is not to be equated with individualism) but also
> extremely high levels of sharing."[^2]

# Culture

The Batek believe that someone who is unjustly angry at may cause the
target of their anger to catch a disease called *ke'oy* involving fever,
depression, and shortness of breath. The angry person needs to control
their emotions to cure the sick person. This belief promotes
peacefulness by discouraging extreme anger and grudges.[^3]

Batek society treats women and men equally. Marriage is monogamous, and
divorce can easily be attained by either partner.[^4]

Children are raised with enormous freedom, and their minimal
restrictions or discipline have to do with safeguarding them from
tigers, strangers, and the thunder god. To teach them the value of
sharing, children are often encouraged to deliver food to other
families.[^5]

## Religion

Anthropologist Kirk Endicott summarizes:

> "Batek religion was based on a belief in a number of specialized
> superhuman beings that inhabited the forest, firmament, and
> underworld. They were thought to be responsible for many natural
> phenomena, both benefi cial and detrimental to the Batek. The most
> important superhuman being was Gobar, the thunder god, who was
> involved in sending honey bees and the blossoms of wild fruit trees to
> earth, but who also caused thunderstorms to punish people who broke
> certain prohibitions (called lawac), ranging from laughing at
> butterflies to violence. A female underground deity, Ya’
> (“Grandmother”), assisted Gobar by causing floods to well up beneath
> the offender’s camp. The creator god, Tohan, also punished
> disrespectful acts (tolah) by causing offenders to incur diseases or
> accidents. Batek communicated with the superhuman beings through
> dreams and self-induced trances in night-long singing sessions in
> which they asked for such things as abundant supplies of wild fruits
> or help in curing diseases."[^6]

> "Batek regarded violent behavior as a sign of madness. I was told that
> if a person were violent during life, the superhuman beings would
> refuse to take the offender’s shadow soul to the afterworld aft er
> death. Th e shadow soul was doomed to roam the forest as a malevolent
> ghost."[^7]

# Decisions

Endicott:

> "No Batek person had political power over anyone else. Although they
> had nominal headmen (Malay penghulu), who were appointed by the
> Department of Orang Asli Affairs, the headmen had no authority within
> Batek society. Natural leaders, usually respected older people of
> either sex, had some influence, but they could not impose their wishes
> on others. Most decisions about what work to do, where to move, and so
> on were made by individuals or married couples, often after
> consultation with other camp residents."[^8]

# Economy

The Batek share all food, including vegetables and meat. They do not
have private property.[^9]

# Environment

The Batek have a taboo on laughing at animals and plants. Anthropologist
Alice Rudge writes, "Adhering to these taboos is seen as ethical
behaviour, a way that people demonstrate respect for the non-human
persons of the forest that provide the Batek with sustenance."[^10]

# Crime

Interpersonal violence is strictly prohibited and violators may be
ostracized. When there's a serious dispute, the community organizes a
public discussion to resolve it. If resolution fails, then one of the
parties will often leave for a while until emotions dissipate.[^11]

Kevin Tucker wrote in 2018 that there were no known cases of homicide
among the Batek.[^12] Endicott corroborates this lack of known homicide
with the exception of one woman who killed two of her children during
"bouts of insanity." Endicott describes Batek society as extraordinarily
peaceful:

> "The Batek prohibition on violence ensured that social life in camps
> was generally harmonious. No one had to fear being hurt by anyone
> else. Th is prohibition enhanced the personal autonomy of all
> Batek—one of their basic values—because it meant that no one could
> coerce another to do anything against their wishes. Even children had
> great freedom and independence. The prohibition on violence also
> contributed to the equality of the sexes by preventing men from using
> force against weaker women."[^13]
