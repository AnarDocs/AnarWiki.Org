In northwestern France, green patches on the beach look like seaweed but
are actually translucent worms. Green algae lives inside them, making
them appear green. This worm serves as a greenhouse for the algae, and
the algae provides food for the worm. It is hard to tell where one
begins and the other ends. The evolution of this creature is an example
of how symbiogenesis, or how species evolve in cooperation with one
another. The scientific name of this worm is *Convoluta roscoffensis*,
but the Englishman who first described them called them
"plant-animals."[^1]
