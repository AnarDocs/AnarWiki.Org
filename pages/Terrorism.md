**Terrorism** refers to the intentional use of violence by a non-state
actor to intimidate civilians for political or religious reasons and
generally takes the forms of plane hijackings, bombings, arson, mass
shootings and hostage taking by an armed groups.

Generally, we at libsoc wiki do not define state actions as terrorism
because of the fundamentally different character of
<a href="State_Violence" class="wikilink" title="state violence">state
violence</a>. This is for the purpose of analysis and should not be
confused with endorsement of state violence. We also do not think
<a href="militancy" class="wikilink" title="militancy">militancy</a> by
non-state actors counts as terrorism, which needs to be based
specifically around the spreading of fear through a civilian population.

Terrorism has a notably high failure rate and is probably the least
productive form of <a href="Political_Activism" class="wikilink"
