# Propaganda of the Deed

**Propaganda of the deed** is a form of direct action where the action
itself serves as propaganda to inspire others toward social revolution.
Rather than convincing people through words alone, propaganda of the
deed demonstrates anarchist principles through concrete acts of defiance
against authority, property, and the state.

## Origins

The foundations of propaganda of the deed emerged in the early 19th
century when members of the student counterculture began calling for
revolutionary action rather than merely theoretical discussion.[^1]

The Italian socialist Carlo Pisacane first outlined the concept in 1857,
rejecting "propaganda of the idea" in favor of action. Pisacane believed
that "ideas result from deeds" and that "people will not be free when
they are educated, but educated when they are free."[^2] To him, all
citizens should cooperate with social revolution through conspiracies
and direct action against the ruling class.

The theory was formalized in 1869 by Russian revolutionaries Mikhail
Bakunin and Sergey Nechayev, who favored insurrectionary direct action
over "pointless propaganda" disconnected from reality. In August 1870,
Bakunin called for revolutionaries to propagate revolutionary principles
through deeds rather than words, believing revolutionary actors should
focus on acts of destruction as a necessary prelude to social
revolution.[^3]

## Development by Italian Anarchists

Following the suppression of the Paris Commune and rising political
repression in the 1870s, many European anarchists grew impatient with
gradualist methods like education and industrial action. They turned
toward propaganda by the deed as a means to accelerate social change and
bring about revolution.[^4]

Italian activists Carlo Cafiero, Andrea Costa, and Errico Malatesta
joined the nascent anarchist movement and organized political
demonstrations and strike actions, aiming to incite uprisings that would
escalate into generalized insurrection. After the defeat of the 1874
Bologna insurrection, Cafiero and Malatesta adopted propaganda by the
deed as their primary strategy.

At the 1876 Bern Congress of the Anti-authoritarian International,
Malatesta argued that revolutions were driven by deeds, not words. He
proposed that revolutionary socialists were obliged to support workers'
movements whenever class conflict erupted. The French anarchist Paul
Brousse became convinced by these arguments and emerged as a leading
proponent, calling for workers to seize the means of production,
peasants to occupy land, and people to rise up and establish a free
association of producers.

Three months after the Bern Congress, Malatesta and Cafiero defined
propaganda of the deed in the Jura Federation's *Bulletin*, declaring
that actions affirming socialist principles were the most effective form
of propaganda.[^5] At a subsequent congress in Florence, they passed a
resolution confirming the insurrectionary character of the Italian
anarchist movement.

### Actions in Practice

A series of actions demonstrated propaganda by the deed in the late
1870s. On 18 March 1877, the sixth anniversary of the Paris Commune,
Paul Brousse led a demonstration in Bern carrying a red flag through the
streets, aiming to raise class consciousness by provoking state
repression.

In April 1877, Cafiero and Malatesta carried out an insurrection in the
southern province of Benevento. They put two small villages under armed
occupation, burned tax registers, and proclaimed the overthrow of the
Kingdom of Italy. Despite being welcomed by local peasants, they did not
receive active support, and the insurrection was quickly suppressed.
However, the action served its purpose as propaganda, demonstrating
anarchist principles in practice.

## Theoretical Debates

During the late 1870s, debates intensified over propaganda of the deed.
These discussions analyzed the relationship between individual actions
and wider society, as symbolic rebellious acts were intended to trigger
generalized revolution. Questions arose over whether propaganda by the
deed supplemented educational work or replaced written and spoken
propaganda entirely.

In August 1877, Brousse wrote that propaganda of the deed was intended
to set an example, educate people, and incite further action. Cafiero
proposed that revolutionary ends justified any means. In an article
published in *Le Révolté* in December 1880, he called for anarchists to
use any means necessary to incite permanent revolution, whether through
writing and public speaking, violent attacks, or even voting.[^6]

At this time, propaganda by the deed was defined as any act of rebellion
against the existing system, not necessarily violent actions. It did not
yet carry the inherent implication of violence it would later assume.

### Differing Perspectives

While Italian anarchists advocated for propaganda of the deed, other
anarchists maintained different approaches. Peter Kropotkin continued to
advocate for education, believing small groups of revolutionaries should
enter larger workers' organizations, particularly trade unions, and
agitate for social revolution. He was ambivalent toward revolutionary
violence, rejecting Bakunin's conspiratorial methods and preferring
peaceful propaganda when possible.[^7]

However, Kropotkin was not opposed to violent actions when they were
part of a larger revolutionary movement, had a clear purpose, and were
directed against specific oppressive structures. He refused to condemn
anarchists engaged in terrorism, emphasizing state terrorism as a
motivating factor in individual terrorism. Though personally repulsed by
violence, he believed it necessary in some cases when directed against
economic forces rather than individual targets. Kropotkin personally
objected to Cafiero's definition of propaganda by the deed and preferred
not to use the term.[^8]

The French ecologist Élisée Reclus advocated for propaganda by the deed
by the turn of the 1880s, though he personally preferred propaganda by
the word. Reclus believed any revolt against oppression was inherently
justified and that the means were neutral. He considered individual
terrorism acceptable if it weakened the state, declaring that "all
revolutionary acts are, by their very nature, essentially anarchical,
whatever the power which seeks to profit from them."[^9]

In the United States, German anarchist Johann Most became a fervent
promoter of propaganda by the deed, believing it could raise the class
consciousness of the American working class. He toured the country
giving speeches inciting revolutionary violence against Wall Street and
the capitalist ruling class. Most gained notoriety for claiming every
criminal was an anarchist. He learned bomb-making while working at an
explosives factory and published a pamphlet detailing bomb manufacture.
He believed revolutionary ends justified any means, including
assassinations of individual targets. Though Most never acted according
to his doctrine, he inspired many revolutionaries to carry out
propaganda by the deed. He was considered the most dangerous man in
America, though he distanced himself from advocacy of violence after the
Haymarket affair.[^10]

## Luigi Galleani and Armed Propaganda

Luigi Galleani emerged as perhaps the most vocal proponent of propaganda
by the deed from the turn of the century through the end of the First
World War. He took undisguised pride in describing himself as a
subversive, a revolutionary propagandist, and an advocate of the violent
overthrow of established government and institutions through direct
action - bombings and assassinations.[^11]

Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only
against symbols of government and capitalism such as courthouses and
factories, but also through direct assassination of "enemies of the
people": capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and police.
He had particular interest in bombs, going so far as to include a
formula for explosive nitroglycerin in one of his pamphlets advertised
through his monthly magazine, *Cronaca Sovversiva*.[^12]

By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and
advocate of violent action, attracting devoted Italian-American
anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanisti. Carlo Buda,
brother of Galleanist bombmaker Mario Buda, said of him, "You heard
Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you
saw."[^13]

## Relationship to Social Revolution

Propaganda of the deed included stealing (particularly bank robberies
termed "expropriations" or "revolutionary expropriations" to finance
political activity), rioting, and general strikes aimed at creating
conditions for insurrection or revolution. These acts were justified as
necessary counterparts to state repression.

For Gustav Landauer, propaganda of the deed meant creating libertarian
social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform
society.[^14]

### Marxist Critique

As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by
anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state
repression. "The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can
argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of
terrorist acts on the masses," he wrote, "Theoretical considerations and
political experience prove otherwise."[^15]

Vladimir Lenin largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of
terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by
disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged
the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination as catalyst for
revolution, but distinguished between ad hoc bombings and assassinations
carried out by proponents of propaganda of the deed and organized
violence coordinated by a professional revolutionary vanguard.[^16]

## Forms and Methods

Propaganda of the deed took many forms beyond assassinations and
bombings. Errico Malatesta outlined several practical applications in
1889, emphasizing actions accessible to ordinary people rather than
requiring elaborate planning or special skills.[^17]

He proposed that on anniversaries and special occasions, groups of
comrades could burst into wealthy grocery, clothing, and footwear stores
and distribute their contents to poor people. In the countryside, small
teams could overwhelm landowners' warehouses and invite peasants to take
wheat, oil, wine, tools, and other goods. These actions would be
accompanied by manifestoes explaining the action, discussing past
struggles, and pointing toward future battles.

Malatesta argued such actions offered the "double advantage of a direct
assault on property" and being "feasible for all, and applicable, in
however varied a form, always and everywhere." He emphasized that
private ownership was the foundation upon which exploitation,
oppression, and all the ills of modern civilization rested, and
therefore must be destroyed.[^18]

He provided numerous examples of everyday propaganda by the deed:
wrestling a strongbox away from an employer distributing wages and
tossing the cash to workers; ejecting a landlord collecting rents;
seizing carts arriving to collect a farmer's harvest and dividing the
loads among the neediest families; confronting tax collectors;
responding to evictions with vengeance; butchering bulls and rams being
fattened for masters' tables and distributing the meat to malnourished
peasants.[^19]

Malatesta contrasted this approach with classical insurrectionary
bands - formal, solemn organizations requiring extensive preparation,
secrecy, specialized personnel, and authoritarian organization. Instead,
he advocated for "unfettered, spontaneous, and unrelenting action of
individuals and groups" - temporary bands forming to carry out specific
acts and disbanding immediately after, even before authorities became
aware.[^20]

## Contemporary Perspectives

Modern anarchist writers have defended propaganda of the deed against
common critiques. Peter Gelderloos addresses two prevalent arguments
against the tactic: that such actions are actually the work of
infiltrators and provocateurs, and that they scare people away from the
movement.[^21]

Regarding infiltration, Gelderloos notes that actual infiltrators aim
for pacification of struggle, spreading codes of nonviolence while doing
nothing to disarm police or the far right. While police have
occasionally orchestrated bombings, these can be distinguished from
authentic anarchist actions: police-orchestrated attacks typically go
off in protest marches, marketplaces in working class neighborhoods, or
have otherwise questionable targets with messy results. Anarchist
attacks overwhelmingly struck police, key capitalists and
industrialists, or high-ranking government officials, usually as direct
response to brutal repression.[^22]

The claim that such actions "scared people away" is contradicted by
historical evidence. Between 1890 and 1910, when Barcelona was the
center of propaganda by the deed, these actions were immensely popular
among broad swathes of the working class, showing that justice could be
achieved and that the wretched of the earth had power to strike back.
The purpose of police-orchestrated attacks was actually to blur the
lines between principled attacks against murderous rulers and sloppy
attacks including members of lower classes among victims, making it
easier to denounce all forms of revolutionary attack.[^23]

### Modern Examples

The 2024 assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson
demonstrated the continued relevance of propaganda by the deed. Though
the alleged perpetrator was not an anarchist, polling showed at least
half of young people supported the action, far more than opposed it. At
a time when healthcare is treated as a business and insurance companies
profit while people suffer and die from treatable illnesses, the killing
showed a refusal to quietly die invisible, polite deaths.[^24]

Gelderloos argues the action's value lay in cutting through political
rhetoric: "independent of their political identities, some people sided
with the system, and some people sided with life. Those are exactly the
points of rupture that anarchists, that any serious and sincere
revolutionaries, need to inhabit."[^25]

Similarly, during the 2020 uprising following George Floyd's murder, a
majority of people supported toppling statues, taking over highways and
city blocks, and burning police stations. The only people denouncing
those actions sided with police. When anarchists condemn the methods
that most elicit moral horror from the bourgeoisie, they lose their
ability to be present to what actually inspires people ground down by
the system.[^26]

## Individualist Perspectives

Some contemporary anarchists articulate propaganda of the deed in
explicitly individualist terms. From this perspective, propaganda by the
deed represents individual defiance of those who would seek to rule,
with actions not policed by morals or law. The deed's undeniable reality
speaks for itself - when someone smashes an ATM and walks away, that act
stands as its own propaganda.[^27]

This approach emphasizes that one individual can damage significant
property, prevent thousands from utilizing capitalist infrastructure, or
influence millions through viral media. The individual becomes the sole
decider of their actions, not morality or law. Such actions represent
taking control of one's life rather than hoping for eventual
revolution - the insurrection exists in the current moment.[^28]

From this perspective, objections based on moralism or legality miss the
point entirely. Private property's guarantee exists only through law,
which threatens violence against anyone defying it. Property itself is
violence. The acts of capitalists are therefore evil, while anarchistic
propaganda by the deed is noble and virtuous. No one can deny the
reality of the deed itself - what people can do is apply moral dogma to
damn those who carry it out.[^29]

This individualist approach argues the purpose of the deed is that it
serves as its own propaganda for anarchism in multiple ways and through
various interpretations. Those who would impose their will as right and
absolute seek to be rulers, and should be rejected.[^30]

## State Repression

State repression of the anarchist and labor movements following
successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to
abandonment of these tactics, though reciprocally state repression may
have played a role in isolated acts in the first place. The
dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups, and
following suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile
of many communards to penal colonies, favored individualist political
expression and acts.[^31]

The infamous 1894 French *lois scélérates* (scoundrel laws) specifically
targeted anarchist propaganda and association, criminalizing even verbal
support for anarchist actions. These repressive measures demonstrated
how the state responded to propaganda of the deed not merely by
arresting perpetrators but by attacking the entire anarchist movement
and its ability to communicate.
