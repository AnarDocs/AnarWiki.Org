# Anarchist Critique of "The Tyranny of Structurelessness"

## Overview

**"The Tyranny of Structurelessness"** by
"<a   href="Jo_Freeman.md" class="wikilink" title="Jo Freeman">Jo Freeman</a>,
first presented in 1970, has been a controversial text within anarchist
circles since its publication. While some
"<a   href="social_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="social anarchists">social anarchists</a> have found value in its
analysis of informal hierarchies, the essay has faced substantial
criticism from anarchist theorists who argue it fundamentally
misunderstands anarchist organizational principles and contradicts
successful historical examples of anarchist organizing.[^1]

## Context and Initial Reception

Freeman's essay emerged from her experiences in the
"<a   href="women&#39;s_liberation_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s liberation movement">women's liberation movement</a>
of the late 1960s and early 1970s, specifically targeting what she
perceived as ineffective "structureless" consciousness-raising groups.
However, anarchist critics have noted that Freeman was never an
anarchist herself, participating instead as a critic of radicals in
movements like the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, and later becoming a
political scientist and lawyer working within formal political party
structures.[^2]

The essay's popularity among certain leftist and platformist anarchist
tendencies has been controversial, with critics arguing that
uncritically citing Freeman's work "is somewhat akin to uncritically
citing Marxist-Leninist or Stalinist tracts on the necessity for
political parties."[^3]

## Major Anarchist Critiques

### The False Dichotomy

Anarchist theorists argue that Freeman creates a false choice between
"structureless" groups and formal hierarchical organization.
"<a   href="Cathy_Levine.md" class="wikilink" title="Cathy Levine">Cathy
Levine</a> responded that Freeman fails to recognize alternative models
of organization, particularly the anarchist model of "small groups in
voluntary association" which differs from both the supposed
structurelessness Freeman critiques and the formal structures she
advocates.[^4]

The "<a   href="Anarchist_Federation.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchist Federation">Anarchist Federation</a> notes that
Freeman's analysis overlooks the fact that anarchist groups have always
employed various organizational methods appropriate to different
situations, including delegation, rotation of tasks, and transparent
decision-making processes - the very principles Freeman recommends -
without adopting the rigid formal structures she advocates.[^5]

### Misunderstanding of Anarchist Organization

Critics point out that Freeman's essay attacks a strawman version of
anarchist organization. Anarchists have never advocated for truly
"structureless" groups, but rather for non-hierarchical, voluntary, and
flexible organizational forms. As Levine notes: "The reason for building
a movement on a foundation of collectives is that we want to create a
revolutionary culture consistent with our view of the new society; it is
more than a reaction; the small group is a solution."[^6]

Jason McQuinn argues that Freeman's "fear of freedom, friendship and
community, as well as the fetish for sterile, reified, rule-bound
relationships" reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of anarchist
principles.[^7]

### The Problem of Formal Structures

Anarchist critics argue that formal structures create more problems than
they solve:

- Formal organizations are actually more susceptible to takeover by
  elites, as they provide ready-made hierarchies for ambitious
  individuals to climb[^8]
- The problems Freeman identifies in informal groups are "much more
  prevalent, virulent and destructive in large, formal
  organizations"[^9]
- Formal structures often alienate individuals and reduce them to "cogs
  in the wheel" rather than nurturing individual contributions[^10]

### Historical Examples

Anarchists point to numerous successful examples of non-hierarchical
organization that contradict Freeman's claims:

- The "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> of 1936-1939, where
  anarchist collectives organized production and defense without formal
  hierarchies
- "<a   href="Indigenous.md" class="wikilink" title="Indigenous">Indigenous</a>
  and "<a   href="hunter-gatherer.md" class="wikilink"
  title="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> societies that maintained
  egalitarian social relations for millennia
- Contemporary anarchist projects and cooperatives that function
  effectively without formal leadership structures[^11]

"<a   href="Howard_J._Ehrlich.md" class="wikilink"
title="Howard J. Ehrlich">Howard J. Ehrlich</a> documented the negative
impact of Freeman's article on anarchist organizing in *Reinventing
Anarchy, Again*, noting how it has been used to justify hierarchical
structures within supposedly anarchist organizations.[^12]

## Points of Agreement

Despite fundamental disagreements, some anarchists acknowledge valuable
insights in Freeman's analysis:

- The recognition that completely unstructured groups are impossible -
  all groups develop some form of organization
- The danger of hidden informal hierarchies that can develop without
  conscious attention to group dynamics
- The importance of making decision-making processes transparent and
  accessible
- The need for accountability mechanisms within revolutionary
  organizations[^13]

However, anarchists argue these insights were already part of anarchist
theory and practice, citing historical anarchist thinkers like
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> who addressed similar concerns while maintaining
anti-authoritarian principles.[^14]

## Alternative Approaches

### Building Revolutionary Culture

Levine and other anarchist feminists argue for developing a
revolutionary culture that nurtures individuals while building
collective power. This involves:

- Creating supportive environments that value different personal styles
  and contributions
- Balancing individual development (75% of time) with collective work
  (25% of time) to prevent burnout[^15]
- Building relationships based on mutual aid and friendship rather than
  formal roles
- Developing practices that address psychological and emotional aspects
  of oppression alongside political organizing[^16]

### Theory and Practice

Contemporary anarchist organizations like LIZA (Libertarian Initiative
of Anarchist Action) have extended the critique, arguing that both
structure and theory must be explicit and collectively developed, but
without adopting hierarchical forms. They emphasize:

- The need for clear revolutionary theory developed through collective
  practice
- Rootedness in working-class struggles and communities
- Formal structures that remain horizontal and directly democratic
- Education and debate as essential components of revolutionary
  organizing[^17]

## Contemporary Relevance

The debate remains relevant as anarchist movements continue to grapple
with questions of organization. While Freeman's essay has been
influential, anarchist critics argue it has often been misused to
justify hierarchical structures within ostensibly anti-authoritarian
movements. As McQuinn notes, the essay "primarily appeals to bookish,
socially-incompetent — or anti-social — people interested in politics,
but unsure of themselves or unwilling (or unable) to negotiate social
relationships which aren't based on written rules."[^18]

The Anarchist Federation concludes that while consciousness-raising and
informal networks remain vital, the key challenge is developing
organizational forms that can "consolidate gains" without reproducing
hierarchical structures - a task that requires going beyond both
Freeman's analysis and simple rejection of all structure.[^19]
