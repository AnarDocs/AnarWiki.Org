Although this study does not speak specifically about anarchism it does
bring out some interesting research about the role of non-hierarchal
societies that have often been interpreted as being matriarchal.

## Hierarchy

The sources discuss hierarchy extensively, primarily in contrast to
matriarchal societies and as a concept imposed by certain historical
interpretations[^1].

### Matriarchy as Non-Hierarchical

- Modern matriarchal studies define matriarchy as mother-centered,
  gender-egalitarian societies that practice the gift economy[^2] .
- Key characteristics of these societies include equality, consensus
  finding, gift-giving, and peace-building by negotiations[^3] .
- Modern matriarchal studies primarily assesses the patterns of these
  cultures in their unique displays of gender egalitarianism and
  generally social egalitarianism[^4] .
- Heide Goettner-Abendroth's systematic definition describes matriarchy
  as gender-egalitarian and consensus-oriented, manifesting maternal
  values in matrilinearity, matrilocality, and gift-giving food
  distribution[^5]. This structure is explicitly based on consensus
  rather than power relations[^6]
- The Minangkabau of Sumatra, for example, are known not only for their
  egalitarian male-female relationships but also for their adaptability
  and vitality based on gift economies[^7].
- Studies of the Kuna people of Central America describe a sophisticated
  and intentional matriarchal structure behind the Kuna's egalitarian
  system[^8].
- The Iroquois matriarchal structure was seeded by the Head Clan Mother,
  Jigonsaseh, who insisted on an agricultural subsistence base[^9].
  Their constitution included laws recognizing that women alone
  possessed the land, giving them sole economic control and jurisdiction
  over governmental positions[^10]. Women's ceremonial dances reflected
  and supported their high cultural prestige[^11]. Their high status
  derived from their role as keepers of the female half of the twinned
  cosmos[^12].

### Critique of Imposing Hierarchy

- Historical scholarship, often filtered through an androcentric
  lens[^13] and patriarchal paradigm[^14], distorted comprehension of
  matriarchal societies.
- Nineteenth-century scholars, influenced by unilinear, universal
  evolution theory[^15] rooted in colonialism[^16], dismissed matriarchy
  or portrayed it crudely[^17] .
- Modern Matriarchal Studies criticizes and revises the situation where
  patriarchal patterns are projected onto cultural history when only
  patriarchal society is known[^18] .
- Historical archaeology often focused on reconstructing structures like
  "vast ruins and lists of kings and dynasties," assuming the first
  towns and civilizations arose from definitions that included
  concentration of profit, a ruling class and hierarchy, organized into
  a permanent state[^19]. This perspective was based on a problematic
  definition of a city[^20] .
- Scholars sometimes read "leading elites" into pre-patriarchal
  civilizations with egalitarian characteristics, erroneously equating a
  greater division of labor and complexity with hierarchy[^21].

### Evidence Challenging Hierarchical Interpretations

- The Walls of Jericho, previously interpreted as defenses to protect
  the "profit" of the "elite," are now understood as flood
  protection[^22], undermining the belief in fortifications for war
  purposes in Neolithic times[^23].
- The hypothesis that the Neolithic way of life arose from "social
  competition and rivalry" with the formation of "elites" has been
  criticized[^24]; instead, social cohesion through cooperation and
  religious buildings consolidated collective identity[^25] .
- Larger Neolithic buildings, once conceived as "chieftain seats," are
  reinterpreted as community houses[^26].
- Monumental temples like Göbekli Tepe were initially interpreted as
  expressing the dominance of a male elite[^27], but this has been
  revised to interpreting them as temples for ancestors[^28] .
- Studies of Çatal Höyük indicate an egalitarian society based on equal
  house size and burial practices for both sexes[^29]. The equality in
  this urban culture attests to a matriarchal society[^30].
- Bone wear patterns from Central Anatolia show no evidence that one
  gender's labor was "worth less than the other, or that one gender bore
  the bulk of the work while being controlled by the other"[^31]. Burial
  practices in southeast Anatolia also attest to social equality[^32].
- In Neolithic Europe, critical archaeologists increasingly move away
  from the concept of "elites" and "hierarchy"[^33] . Social complexity
  is not the same as hierarchy[^34] , and economic differentiation and
  specialization cannot be equated with social differentiation,
  inequality, and political centralization[^35] .
- Studies of Minoan Crete challenge the conventional image of a central
  monarch ("Minos")[^36] and show no centralization of goods in the
  so-called "royal palaces"[^37]; goods were in general circulation, not
  hoarded by "elites"[^38]. There was no "palace state" or discernible
  political centers[^39]. Minoan Crete is described as an egalitarian
  matriarchal society based on consensus rather than power
  relations[^40].
- A Neolithic mural from southern Germany depicting female ancestors of
  equal size demonstrates an egalitarian, mother-centered society[^41].
- Etruscan Italy is described as having an egalitarian relationship and
  partnership between the two sexes[^42], and the existence of a
  hierarchical system of "elites" and "dependents" is fundamentally
  doubted[^43].

### Patriarchy as Including Hierarchy

- The definition of patriarchally organized city-states includes
  concentration of profit, a ruling class and hierarchy, organized into
  a permanent state[^44] .
- The rise of patriarchy is linked to men overthrowing matriarchy to
  seize control of the home, enabled by control over private property
  which replaced communal property[^45].
- The situation of women under patriarchal conditions implies their
  status within a hierarchical structure[^46].
- The rise of patriarchy in Europe is linked to incursions of
  male-dominated herding cultures from the Eurasian steppes[^47]. These
  cultures are indicated by an increase in status symbols found in men's
  graves[^48]. These cultures were led by chiefs whose power grew
  enormously[^49] .
- Colonialism is presented as imposing a patriarchal paradigm and
  patriarchal descent, damaging previous social structures[^50].

### Societies with Matriarchal Traces and Other Hierarchies

- Among the islander Celts, powerful queen mothers, reigning queens,
  female judges, and priestesses existed, but these phenomena were often
  confined to the ruling class, while the status of ordinary women was
  not ideal[^51].
- Among the Germanic peoples, upper-class women could be priestesses,
  while ordinary women remained dependent according to clan law[^52].
- The modern Basque society, while having matriarchal traces, has an
  inheritance system that discriminates against the younger economically
  and politically, meaning it cannot be claimed that there is an
  egalitarian, matriarchal social order still today[^53].
