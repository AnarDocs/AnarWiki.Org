From Peter Gelderloos, *Anarchy Works*:

"In a number of towns and cities, anarchists hold Really Really Free
Markets — essentially, flea markets without prices. People bring goods
they have made or things they don’t need anymore and give them away for
free to passersby or other participants. Or, they share useful skills
with one another. In one free market in North Carolina, every month:

> two hundred or more people from all walks of life gather at the
> commons in the center of our town. They bring everything from jewelry
> to firewood to give away, and take whatever they want. There are
> booths offering bicycle repair, hairstyling, even tarot readings.
> People leave with full-size bed frames and old computers; if they
> don’t have a vehicle to transport them, volunteer drivers are
> available. No money changes hands, no one haggles over the comparative
> worth of items or services, nobody is ashamed about being in need.
> Contrary to government ordinances, no fee is paid for the use of this
> public space, nor is anyone “in charge.” Sometimes a marching band
> appears; sometimes a puppetry troupe performs, or people line up to
> take a swing at a piñata. Games and conversations take place around
> the periphery, and everyone has a plate of warm food and a bag of free
> groceries. Banners hang from branches and rafters proclaiming “FOR THE
> COMMONS, NOT LANDLORDS OR BUREAUCRACY” and “NI JEFES, NI FRONTERAS”
> and a king-size blanket is spread with radical reading material, but
> these aren’t essential to the event — this is a social institution,
> not a demonstration.

Thanks to our monthly ‘Free Markets, everyone in our town has a working
reference point for anarchist economics. Life is a little easier for
those of us with low or no income, and relationships develop in a space
in which social class and financial means are at least temporarily
irrelevant."[^1]
