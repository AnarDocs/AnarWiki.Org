# Israel / Occupied Palestine

**Israel**, officially the "State of Israel" and referred to by
Palestinians and their supporters as **Occupied Palestine** or the
**Zionist Entity**, is a settler-colonial state in Western Asia
established in 1948 through the violent displacement of the Palestinian
population. From an anarchist perspective, Israel represents a
particularly clear example of how state power, nationalism, militarism,
and imperialism intersect to perpetuate hierarchical domination and
systematic violence.

## Overview

Israel functions as what then-Senator Joe Biden described in 1986 as
essentially a forward operating base for US imperialism: "if Israel
didn't exist, the US would have to invent one to protect US
interests."[^1] The United States provides Israel with \$3.8 billion
annually, mostly for weapons purchases,[^2] making it the largest
recipient of US military aid globally.

The territory comprises land taken through ethnic cleansing in 1948 (the
Nakba), expanded through military conquest in 1967, and continuously
expanded through illegal settlement construction. Israel maintains
military occupation of the West Bank, enforces a devastating blockade on
Gaza, and exercises control over Palestinian movement, resources, and
daily life through what Human Rights Watch and other organizations have
characterized as apartheid.[^3]

## History

### Origins of Political Zionism

The modern Zionist movement emerged in late 19th century Europe as one
response to antisemitic persecution and pogroms, particularly in the
Russian Empire. While some early Zionists, including anarchists like
Joseph Trumpeldor, envisioned communal settlements based on libertarian
socialist principles, the movement became dominated by nationalist and
colonial frameworks.

The 1917 Balfour Declaration saw Britain promise to support a "national
home for the Jewish people" in Palestine—then under British colonial
control—without consulting the existing Palestinian Arab population.
This set the stage for decades of conflict as European Jewish settlers
arrived in increasing numbers, particularly fleeing Nazi persecution in
the 1930s and 1940s.

From an anarchist perspective, the tragedy lies in how legitimate fears
of persecution were channeled into a nationalist, state-building project
that required the displacement of another people rather than challenging
the logic of nation-states and borders that enabled antisemitism in the
first place.

### The Nakba (1947-1949)

Between 1947 and 1949, Zionist militias and the newly formed Israeli
military expelled approximately 750,000 Palestinians—roughly 75% of the
Palestinian population—from their homes in an event Palestinians call
the Nakba (catastrophe).[^4] This was not a spontaneous result of war
but a deliberate campaign outlined in Plan Dalet.

Zionist forces committed at least 29 documented massacres during this
period, including:

- The Deir Yassin massacre (April 9, 1948) where the Irgun militia
  killed nearly the entire village population near Jerusalem
- The assault on Haifa (April 21, 1948) using barrel bombs filled with
  dynamite and gasoline, playing screaming sounds on loudspeakers to
  terrorize the population
- Systematic destruction of over 400 Palestinian villages[^5]

By the early 1950s, 80% of historic Palestine was occupied by the new
Israeli state, with the remainder divided into the West Bank (occupied
by Jordan) and Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt).

### Six Day War and Ongoing Occupation (1967)

In 1967, Israel launched a war against Egypt, Syria, and Jordan,
conquering the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights
within six days. This drove another 300,000 Palestinians from their land
and placed all of historic Palestine under Israeli control.[^6]

Despite international law requiring withdrawal from occupied
territories, Israel has maintained military occupation for over 55
years, making it one of the longest military occupations in modern
history.

### Expansion and Entrenchment (1970s-2000s)

Subsequent decades saw:

- Continuous settlement construction in violation of international law
- Multiple invasions of Lebanon (1978, 1982, 2006)
- The First Intifada (1987-1993), a popular Palestinian uprising met
  with massive violence
- The Oslo Accords (1993), which created the Palestinian Authority but
  allowed Israel to maintain effective control
- The Second Intifada (2000-2005)
- Construction of the separation wall deep inside West Bank territory
- Repeated military assaults on Gaza (2008-09, 2012, 2014, 2021,
  2023-present)

### Genocide in Gaza (2023-Present)

Following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack (which killed approximately
1,400 Israelis), Israel launched what numerous human rights
organizations, genocide scholars, and international observers
characterize as genocide in Gaza.

The assault has:

- Killed tens of thousands of Palestinians (estimates range from 40,000
  to over 100,000 when accounting for those buried under rubble and
  indirect deaths from destroyed healthcare infrastructure)
- Destroyed over 60% of all buildings in Gaza
- Deliberately targeted hospitals, schools, universities, and refugee
  camps
- Used starvation as a weapon of war through aid blockades
- Destroyed Gaza's entire university system, most mosques and churches,
  museums, libraries, and cultural institutions
- Killed hundreds of journalists, medical workers, and humanitarian aid
  workers
- Produced explicitly genocidal statements from Israeli government
  officials calling for Gaza to be "erased" and Palestinians driven into
  the desert

## Anarchist Analysis

### Settler Colonialism and State Violence

Israel exemplifies settler colonialism—a process where colonizers come
not to exploit labor but to replace the indigenous population entirely.
Like the United States, Canada, and Australia, Israel's founding
required the violent removal and ongoing suppression of the existing
population.

The Israeli state maintains this colonial relationship through:

- Military occupation and martial law in the West Bank
- Blockade of Gaza (described by the UN as "collective punishment" and a
  "medieval siege")
- A two-tier legal system where settlers and Palestinians are governed
  by different laws in the same territory
- Home demolitions (hundreds per year) as collective punishment
- Torture, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial killings
- Restriction of Palestinian movement through checkpoints and the
  separation wall
- Control over Palestinian water, electricity, and resource access

This isn't simply "a conflict" between two equal parties but an
asymmetric relationship of domination enforced through state violence.

### The IDF: Rules of Engagement

The Israeli military operates under rules of engagement that permit
extraordinary violence against Palestinians. During the 2018 Great March
of Return—when Palestinians nonviolently marched toward the Gaza
fence—IDF snipers killed 46 children among the 300+ Palestinians
killed.[^7]

Whistleblower testimonies from groups like Breaking the Silence reveal
that soldiers receive orders to shoot children with live ammunition,
making these not isolated incidents but systematic policy executed
through military chain of command. As former IDF soldier Eran Efrati
explained, soldiers don't decide to fire live ammunition
independently—orders are decided, given to soldiers who execute them,
then relayed back to command.

### Surveillance and Social Control

Since 2019, Israel has deployed extensive facial recognition programs in
the West Bank, described by former soldiers as a "secret Facebook for
Palestinians."[^8] In 2020, Israel used Pegasus spyware against
Palestinian human rights activists.[^9]

This surveillance infrastructure connects to the global development of
police and border control technologies—Israeli companies market their
systems as "field-tested" on Palestinians, then export them worldwide,
including to police departments in the United States.

### Israel as Imperial Proxy

Israel functions as a regional enforcer for US imperial interests in the
Middle East. The \$3.8 billion in annual US military aid underwrites
Israeli operations while generating profits for US weapons manufacturers
like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.

This relationship operates bidirectionally:

- The US uses Israel as a forward operating base and regional military
  power to threaten Iran, Syria, and other states resisting US hegemony
- Israeli lobbying through AIPAC and similar organizations shapes US
  Middle East policy, contributing to sanctions on Iran, military
  interventions in Iraq and Syria, and unconditional diplomatic support
  including UN Security Council vetoes

Despite rhetoric about being "the only democracy in the Middle East,"
Israel collaborates extensively with authoritarian regimes when
strategically useful. Israel has provided military aid to the Free
Syrian Army,[^10] Islamic State-linked groups, and numerous repressive
governments globally.

The Israeli arms industry ranks eighth globally, exporting \$9 billion
in military equipment and software in 2019,[^11] with weapons and
surveillance technologies "field-tested" on Palestinians.

### Critique of All Nationalisms

From an anarchist perspective, both Zionism and Palestinian nationalism
represent problematic frameworks, though they exist in radically unequal
power relationships.

Zionism as a nationalist ideology seeks to establish and maintain Jewish
supremacy through state power. This necessarily requires the exclusion
and subordination of non-Jews, as evidenced by the 2018 Nation-State Law
that explicitly defines Israel as exclusively for Jewish
self-determination.

Palestinian nationalism, while emerging as resistance to colonial
displacement, still operates within state-building frameworks that
anarchists critique. However, the immediate material reality is that
Palestinians face violent dispossession and have legitimate claims based
on actual displacement from land they inhabited and worked.

Anarchists distinguish between:

- Occupancy and use rights (someone living on and working land)
- Abstract property claims enforced by state violence

A Palestinian family expelled from Haifa in 1948 has a legitimate claim
based on actual dispossession. But the solution isn't to create a
Palestinian state apparatus that would simply establish new hierarchies
and borders—it's to dismantle all state structures in favor of
federated, decentralized communities based on free association.

### The False "Two-State Solution"

The Oslo Accords divided Palestinian territory into Areas A, B, and C:

- Area A (major Palestinian cities): nominally under Palestinian
  Authority control, but Israel maintains the "right" to enter for
  military operations
- Area B (rural villages): Palestinian civil control, Israeli "security"
  control
- Area C (60% of West Bank): full Israeli control, used for settlements
  and resource extraction

This arrangement was always designed to maintain Israeli control while
creating a façade of Palestinian autonomy. Israel has used the interim
period to massively expand settlements, making any viable Palestinian
state impossible.

The "two-state solution" is dead—not because Palestinians rejected it,
but because Israel systematically destroyed its possibility while
claiming to negotiate. Meanwhile, this framework served to delay action
while the settler-colonial project intensified.

### The Bankrupt "One-State Solution" (Liberal Version)

Liberal proposals for a single democratic state with equal rights for
all often imagine a conventional nation-state with parliamentary
democracy. From an anarchist perspective, this simply proposes replacing
one state apparatus with another, maintaining hierarchical structures
while changing who controls them.

Moreover, given the reality of settler-colonial violence and the depth
of division created by 75+ years of dispossession and conflict, any
state framework will face irresolvable tensions between competing
nationalist claims.

### Anarchist Alternative: No-State Solution

Anarchists propose dismantling all state structures in favor of:

- Federated communities based on free association rather than ethnic or
  religious identity
- Decentralized decision-making through popular assemblies and councils
- Right of return for Palestinian refugees based on actual
  dispossession, not state-mediated "citizenship"
- Shared access to resources (especially water) based on need rather
  than state-controlled distribution
- Horizontal relationships replacing both military occupation and
  nationalist governance

This isn't utopian fantasy—it draws on:

- Historical examples like the early kibbutzim (before they became
  integrated into the state project)
- Current experiments in Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan) and Zapatista
  territories
- Ongoing Palestinian popular committees and mutual aid networks
- Joint Israeli-Palestinian organizing that builds direct relationships
  outside state frameworks

The immediate task is building these alternative structures while
resisting state violence—both the Israeli occupation and the hierarchies
within Palestinian society itself.

## The Gaza Blockade

Since 2007, Israel has enforced a land, sea, and air blockade of Gaza
that the UN has denounced as "collective punishment" and a "medieval
siege."[^12]

The blockade restricts:

- Movement of people (Palestinians cannot leave except in rare
  circumstances)
- Construction materials (preventing rebuilding after Israeli attacks)
- Fuel and electricity (Gaza receives power for only a few hours per
  day)
- Fishing rights (restricted to a few kilometers from shore despite
  international agreements)
- Medical supplies and equipment

This has created:

- Acute food insecurity affecting one million people
- 80% of the population dependent on international aid
- Collapse of healthcare infrastructure
- Contaminated water supply (over 95% of Gaza's water is unfit for human
  consumption)
- Economic devastation with unemployment over 40%

The UN warned in 2012 that Gaza would become "unlivable" by 2020. That
assessment proved correct—Gaza was already a humanitarian catastrophe
before the 2023 genocide.

Israeli military assaults in 2008-09, 2012, 2014, and 2021 repeatedly
devastated Gaza's infrastructure. The 2008-09 assault included
deliberate use of white phosphorus—a chemical weapon—in populated
areas.[^13] The 2014 massacre killed over 500 children.

Egypt, under dictator Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has collaborated with the
blockade despite widespread anger in Egyptian society, closing the Rafah
crossing and even flooding smuggling tunnels that provided Gaza's
economic lifeline.

## Apartheid

Multiple human rights organizations—including Human Rights Watch,
Amnesty International, and the Israeli organizations B'Tselem and Yesh
Din—have concluded that Israel operates an apartheid system.

Key features include:

### Two-Tier Legal System

In the West Bank, Israeli settlers and Palestinians live under different
legal systems:

- Settlers are governed by Israeli civil law with full rights
- Palestinians are governed by Israeli military law with no rights
- The same action (e.g., throwing a stone) receives radically different
  punishments depending on whether the person is Jewish or Palestinian

### Restriction of Movement

Palestinians face over 100 permanent checkpoints in the West Bank, plus
hundreds of temporary "flying checkpoints." They require permits to:

- Travel between Palestinian cities
- Access their own agricultural land when it's near settlements
- Enter Jerusalem (many Palestinians have never seen Jerusalem despite
  living nearby)
- Leave the West Bank

Israeli settlers move freely throughout the territory on settler-only
roads that Palestinians cannot use.

### Separate Infrastructure

- Separate road systems
- Separate water infrastructure (settlers receive unlimited water,
  Palestinians are restricted)
- Separate legal systems
- Separate license plates identifying Palestinian vs Israeli vehicles

### Systematic Discrimination

Israeli law and policy systematically privileges Jews over non-Jews:

- The Law of Return grants automatic citizenship to any Jew worldwide,
  while Palestinian refugees cannot return to homes they were expelled
  from
- The 2018 Nation-State Law defines Israel as exclusively the
  nation-state of the Jewish people, downgrading Arabic from an official
  language
- Government budgets, land allocation, and development systematically
  favor Jewish communities
- Military rule in the West Bank gives soldiers authority over all
  aspects of Palestinian life

This isn't simply inequality within a democratic system—it's a
fundamental structure designed to maintain Jewish demographic and
political supremacy through state power.

## Israeli Society and Internal Contradictions

### Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) Influence

Haredi Jews comprise a growing portion of Israeli society (currently
about 12%, projected to reach 30% by 2050) but face exemption from
military service to study religious texts. This creates massive
resentment among secular Israelis who must serve.

Haredi men largely don't work (over 60% unemployment), relying on state
benefits while raising families averaging 8 children. They receive
exemptions from secular education requirements, leaving children without
knowledge of math, science, or English.

This creates:

- Economic drain (Bank of Israel warns it threatens the economy)
- Political power (Haredi parties are kingmakers in coalitions)
- Cultural conflict (enforcement of Sabbath restrictions, gender
  segregation in public spaces)
- Demographic shifts that alarmed economists predict could collapse the
  state

From an anarchist perspective, this demonstrates how religious authority
can become integrated into state power, creating hierarchical control
through different mechanisms than secular nationalism.

### Discrimination Against Mizrahi and Ethiopian Jews

Despite Zionist rhetoric about a Jewish homeland for all Jews, Israel
maintains internal hierarchies:

Ethiopian Jews face:

- Forced contraception (documented cases of giving Depo-Provera without
  informed consent)
- Highest poverty rate among all Jewish groups
- Disproportionate imprisonment and police brutality
- Housing discrimination
- Lower wages and higher unemployment

Mizrahi Jews (from Middle Eastern and North African countries) have
historically faced:

- Lower social status compared to Ashkenazi (European) Jews
- Discrimination in housing, employment, and education
- Their cultural traditions marginalized in favor of European Jewish
  culture

This reveals how even the supposedly unifying identity of "Jewishness"
becomes stratified within hierarchical state structures along lines of
race and ethnicity.

### Palestinian Citizens of Israel

Approximately 20% of Israeli citizens are Palestinian Arabs (including
Muslims, Christians, and Druze). They face:

- Systematic discrimination in land allocation, housing permits, and
  government budgets
- Restriction from living in hundreds of communities through "acceptance
  committees"
- Exclusion from military service (except Druze, who are conscripted)
  and therefore many employment opportunities and benefits
- Surveillance and criminalization of political organizing
- Attacks by right-wing mobs (especially during military operations in
  Gaza or the West Bank)

The situation of Palestinian citizens reveals the contradiction at the
heart of the "Jewish democratic state"—how can a state be both
"democratic" (implying equality) and "Jewish" (implying supremacy of one
group) without systematically marginalizing non-Jews?

## Resistance Movements

### Palestinian Popular Resistance

Palestinians have resisted occupation through various means:

- Popular committees organizing local resistance
- Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement
- The First and Second Intifadas
- The 2018 Great March of Return
- Agricultural resistance (planting olive trees settlers try to uproot)
- Sumud (steadfastness—remaining on the land despite pressure to leave)
- Cultural preservation and education

From an anarchist perspective, the most interesting resistance forms are
those that build horizontal organization and mutual aid:

- Village popular committees coordinating demonstrations and direct
  action
- Youth groups organizing protests without waiting for political party
  leadership
- Mutual aid networks supporting families of prisoners
- Farmers' cooperatives resisting agricultural colonization

However, Palestinian resistance also includes hierarchical organizations
and authoritarian tendencies that anarchists critique.

### Hamas and Islamic Jihad

Hamas (governing Gaza since 2007) and Islamic Jihad represent Islamist
resistance organizations. From an anarchist perspective, they are:

- Religiously authoritarian (enforcing conservative social codes)
- Hierarchically organized
- Engaging in tactics (like rocket attacks on civilians) that anarchists
  generally oppose

However, anarchists also recognize:

- Hamas emerged from the failure of secular nationalist movements to end
  occupation
- The blockade and repeated Israeli massacres have empowered the most
  militant groups
- Western focus on condemning Hamas serves to deflect from Israeli state
  violence and occupation
- Armed resistance to military occupation is not inherently illegitimate
  (though anarchists debate tactics and strategy)

The anarchist position isn't to support Hamas but to recognize that
authoritarian resistance movements emerge from conditions of extreme
oppression—the solution is to end the occupation and build horizontal
alternatives, not to demand Palestinians accept oppression peacefully.

### Anarchists Against the Wall

Anarchists Against the Wall (2003-late 2010s) represented the most
significant Israeli anarchist intervention in the conflict. Israeli
anarchists worked directly with Palestinian villages to:

- Dismantle sections of the separation wall
- Provide human shields against IDF violence during demonstrations
- Participate in direct action against settlements and occupation
  infrastructure
- Build relationships of solidarity across the colonial divide

Gil Na'amati, a former paratrooper who became an anarchist, was shot in
both legs by the IDF during a 2003 demonstration. The group disbanded
due to:

- Decline in Palestinian popular resistance (partly due to Israeli
  repression)
- Internal disagreements over violence/nonviolence
- Exhaustion from years of state repression

### Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)

The BDS movement, launched in 2005 by Palestinian civil society, calls
for:

- Boycott of Israeli products and institutions
- Divestment from companies profiting from occupation
- Sanctions until Israel complies with international law

BDS draws inspiration from the anti-apartheid movement against South
Africa. While anarchists generally oppose appealing to states to impose
sanctions, many support BDS tactics of boycott and divestment as direct
action against complicity.

Many states and institutions have attempted to criminalize BDS advocacy,
with:

- The UK and many US states introducing anti-BDS legislation
- Universities disciplining students for BDS organizing
- Conflation of BDS advocacy with antisemitism

From an anarchist perspective, these repression attempts reveal how
state power protects Israeli state violence while suppressing grassroots
solidarity.

### Israeli Refuseniks

Refuseniks are Israelis who refuse military service in the occupied
territories (or entirely). Organizations like:

- Breaking the Silence (soldiers documenting occupation abuses)
- Courage to Refuse
- Shministim (high school seniors refusing draft)

These represent cracks in Israeli society, though most refuseniks
maintain Zionist frameworks and simply oppose specific occupation
policies rather than the colonial project itself.

## Anarchist Organizing in Israel/Palestine

### Historical Waves

Israeli anarchist organizing has occurred in three main waves:

**Early Kibbutzim (1900s-1920s)**: Early kibbutzim had libertarian
socialist influences, with anarchist ideas circulating widely. Figures
like Joseph Trumpeldor declared themselves both anarcho-communist and
Zionist, attempting to reconcile these through communal living. This
tradition waned as Zionism became dominated by bourgeois nationalism and
state-building.

**Yiddish Anarchists (1950s)**: Abba Gordin established ASHUACH
(Freedom-Seekers Association), conducting cultural and publishing work.

**Contemporary Movement (1967-present)**: Modern Israeli anarchism
emerged after the 1967 occupation, developing through:

- 1970s: Black Front/Trippy Anarchist Group in Tel Aviv, working with
  Israeli Black Panthers
- 1980s-90s: Punk movement connections, army refusal during First
  Intifada, Israeli Anarchist Federation (1991-93) protesting police
  brutality and McDonald's
- Late 1990s: Environmental organizing against Highway 6, Green Action,
  infoshops, Food Not Bombs
- 2000s-present: Shift toward Palestinian solidarity as central focus

### Palestinian Anarchism

Palestinian society has individual anarchist sympathizers but
historically lacked organized anarchist movements, with the secular left
dominated by Marxist-Leninist organizations like the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

**Fauda** (established 2020) represents the first organized Palestinian
anarchist movement, concentrated in the West Bank and inspired by
international anarchist movements including the George Floyd uprisings.
Fauda focuses on:

- Education in anarchist resistance methods
- Direct action and black bloc tactics
- Media documentation of occupation violence
- Historical education countering Israeli narrative
- Collaboration with anti-Zionist Israeli anarchists

### Cross-Border Solidarity

**Ta'ayush** organized informally to break sieges, deliver supplies to
Palestinian towns, and defend farmers from settler attacks.

**International Solidarity Movement (ISM)** brought international
anarchists for direct action campaigns. ISM activists Rachel Corrie and
Tom Hurndall were killed by the IDF in Gaza. Israel responded with
systematic repression including raids, deportations, and entry denials.

### Current Status

Uri Gordon estimated around 300 politically active anarchists in Israel
circa 2007. The movement remains small but active, particularly around:

- Animal rights (notably strong in Israeli anarchism)
- Anti-militarist organizing and draft resistance
- Support for Palestinian resistance
- Cooperation with Palestinian anarchist initiatives like Fauda

## International Solidarity

Anarchists worldwide have engaged with Palestine solidarity through:

- Direct action against arms manufacturers supplying Israel (factory
  occupations, blockades)
- BDS campaigns targeting complicit institutions
- Refusing to allow Israeli military or intelligence officials to speak
  at universities
- Fundraising for Palestinian mutual aid projects
- Amplifying Palestinian voices and analysis
- Blocking weapons shipments at ports and airports
- Occupying government buildings to demand end to arms sales

Major mobilizations include responses to Israeli assaults on Gaza in
2008-09, 2014, 2021, and especially 2023-present, with anarchists
participating in:

- Port blockades preventing weapons shipments
- Occupations of weapons factories
- Mass demonstrations
- Direct action against companies profiting from occupation
- Support for Palestinian prisoners
- Documentation of Israeli war crimes

## Contradictions and Debates

### Immediate Solidarity vs. Long-Term Vision

Anarchists face tension between:

- Supporting Palestinian liberation movements in the immediate term
  (opposing occupation, settlements, blockade, violence)
- Maintaining that the goal shouldn't be nation-states but federated,
  decentralized communities
- Critiquing nationalist and authoritarian tendencies within Palestinian
  movements
- Not letting anti-statist principles become excuses for abandoning
  people facing immediate violence

This means holding multiple positions simultaneously: solidarity with
Palestinian resistance to occupation, critique of both Zionist and
Palestinian nationalist frameworks, and building toward non-hierarchical
futures.

### Violence and Nonviolence

Debates continue around:

- Whether armed resistance to military occupation is legitimate
- How to evaluate Palestinian rocket attacks vs. Israeli state violence
  (recognizing massive asymmetry)
- Whether nonviolence is a viable strategy against systematic state
  violence
- How to build movements that don't reproduce militaristic hierarchies

### Relationship to Other Tendencies

Israeli anarchists have debated relationships with:

- Zionist "left" (who want to end occupation but maintain Jewish state)
- Palestinian nationalist movements (collaboration vs. critique)
- International solidarity movements (avoiding becoming "tour guides for
  foreigners")
- Marxist Palestinian organizations (tactical alliances despite
  theoretical differences)

### The Question of Return

The Palestinian right of return—for the 750,000 expelled in 1948 and
their millions of descendants—raises questions:

- Do refugees have the right to return to homes they were expelled from?
  (Anarchist answer: yes, based on actual dispossession)
- Does this right require a state to enforce it? (Anarchist answer: no,
  it's based on use and occupancy, not state-mediated citizenship)
- How to reconcile return with Israelis currently living on that land?
  (No easy answer, but state frameworks make resolution impossible by
  turning it into competing nationalist claims)

## Why Israel Matters to Anarchists

### Clearest Example of Settler Colonialism

Israel provides an unusually clear case study of settler colonialism
because:

- The time frame is recent and well-documented
- The process continues actively in the present
- The mechanisms (land expropriation, ethnic cleansing, military
  occupation, legal discrimination) are visible and ongoing
- It connects to global systems of imperialism and militarism

This makes it pedagogically useful for understanding settler colonialism
in contexts like the United States, Canada, Australia—where the same
processes occurred generations or centuries ago and have been
naturalized.

### Nexus of State, Capital, and Militarism

Israel demonstrates how:

- State violence serves capital accumulation (arms industry,
  surveillance technology)
- Nationalism justifies hierarchical control
- Military technology developed for colonial control gets exported
  globally
- Imperial powers use client states as regional enforcers
- "Security" discourse legitimizes unlimited violence against racialized
  populations

### Test Case for Resistance Strategies

The Palestinian struggle has tested various resistance approaches:

- Armed struggle (mixed results, often counterproductive)
- Nonviolent mass movements (brutally repressed but sometimes effective)
- International solidarity and BDS (some successes despite repression)
- Diplomatic negotiations (completely failed, used to delay while
  intensifying colonization)
- Popular committees and horizontal organizing (ongoing)

Studying these helps anarchists everywhere think through strategies
against state violence and colonial control.

### Connection to Global Struggles

Palestine solidarity connects to:

- Anti-imperialism (US imperial system)
- Prison abolition (mass incarceration of Palestinians)
- Border abolition (walls, checkpoints, population control)
- Refugee solidarity (Palestinian refugees, broader refugee struggles)
- Anti-racism (racialized violence, apartheid systems)
- Anti-militarism (weapons development, arms trade)
- Police abolition (Israeli training of US police, surveillance
  technology)

This makes Palestine a junction point where multiple liberation
struggles intersect.

## Criticism of "Both Sides" Framing

Mainstream discourse frequently presents the conflict as "both sides"
with equal responsibility for violence. Anarchists reject this false
equivalence:

- Israel is an occupying military power with overwhelming force (nuclear
  weapons, advanced military, unlimited US support)
- Palestinians are a colonized population under military occupation with
  minimal weapons
- The power asymmetry is enormous (Israeli casualties are a tiny
  fraction of Palestinian casualties)
- One side has a state apparatus that systematically dispossesses and
  controls the other
- Focusing on Palestinian violence deflects from the structural violence
  of occupation

This doesn't mean anarchists endorse all Palestinian tactics or
strategies, but rejects treating colonizer and colonized as morally
equivalent.

Similarly, anarchists reject "pro-Israel" vs. "pro-Palestine" framing
that treats this as a sporting match or identity politics. The question
isn't which nationalist project to support but how to end hierarchical
domination and build liberatory alternatives.

## Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism

Anarchists distinguish sharply between:

- **Antisemitism**: prejudice against or hatred of Jewish people based
  on their Jewishness
- **Anti-Zionism**: opposition to Zionism as a political ideology and
  the Israeli state

These are not equivalent. Many Jews are anti-Zionist (including many
anarchists), and opposition to Israeli state violence is not
antisemitism.

However, anarchists also recognize that:

- Some anti-Zionist discourse does deploy antisemitic tropes (conspiracy
  theories about Jewish control, etc.)
- Real antisemitism exists and is growing globally
- The Israeli state cynically weaponizes accusations of antisemitism to
  silence criticism
- Antisemitism and anti-Zionism can become entangled and must be
  carefully distinguished

Anarchists oppose all forms of ethnic or religious supremacy—including
both antisemitism and Zionism (which explicitly seeks Jewish supremacy
through state power).

## Conclusion

From an anarchist perspective, Israel/Occupied Palestine demonstrates
how state power, nationalism, colonialism, and militarism intersect to
create and maintain hierarchical domination. The solution isn't to
create a Palestinian state to compete with the Israeli state, nor to
maintain Israeli apartheid, but to dismantle all state structures in
favor of federated communities based on free association, mutual aid,
and horizontal organization.

This requires:

- Immediate solidarity with Palestinians resisting occupation and
  genocide
- Building alternative structures outside state frameworks
- Critiquing nationalist ideologies on all sides
- Connecting to global struggles against state violence and imperialism
- Learning from both successes and failures of resistance strategies
- Refusing to abandon anti-statist principles while refusing to abandon
  people facing violence

The struggle isn't between two nationalisms but between hierarchical
domination and liberatory possibilities—between state power and human
freedom.
