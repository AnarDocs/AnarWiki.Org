# Direct Action

**Direct action** is a form of activism in which participants use
agency—for example economic power or political power—to achieve their
goals. The aim of direct action is to either obstruct a certain practice
such as a government's laws or actions or to solve perceived problems
without appealing to authorities or intermediaries.

Direct action may include activities, that can be either violent or
nonviolent, targeting people, groups, institutions, actions, or property
that its participants deem objectionable. Violent direct action may
include political violence, assault, arson, sabotage, and property
destruction. Nonviolent direct action may include civil disobedience,
sit-ins, strikes, and counter-economics.[^1]

## Origins

The term and concept of direct action originated in fin de siècle France
according to philosopher José Ortega y Gasset.[^2] The Industrial
Workers of the World union first mentioned the term "direct action" in a
publication about the 1910 Chicago strike.[^3]

American anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre wrote the essay "Direct Action"
in 1912, offering historical examples such as the Boston Tea Party and
the American anti-slavery movement, and writing that "direct action has
always been used, and has the historical sanction of the very people now
reprobating it."[^4]

William Mellor defined direct action in 1920 as "the use of some form of
economic power for securing of ends desired by those who possess that
power." He considered it a tool of both owners and workers, including
lockouts and cartels as well as strikes and sabotage.[^5]

Canadian anarchist Ann Hansen, one of the Squamish Five, wrote that "the
essence of direct action \[...\] is people fighting for themselves,
rejecting those who claim to represent their true interests, whether
they be revolutionaries or government officials".[^6]

## Anarchist Practice

Anarchists organize almost exclusively through direct action,[^7] which
they use due to a rejection of party politics and a refusal to work
within hierarchical bureaucratic institutions.[^8][^9]

From an anarchist perspective, direct action represents the fundamental
principle of self-liberation and mutual aid - the idea that people
should solve their own problems collectively rather than relying on
states, political parties, or other hierarchical institutions. This
approach embodies the anarchist principle that the means must prefigure
the ends: a free society cannot be achieved through authoritarian
methods.

## Historical Examples

### Labor Movement

The Belgian general strike of 1893 demonstrated mass direct action by
workers demanding universal suffrage and better working conditions. The
Industrial Workers of the World pioneered numerous direct action tactics
including strikes, workplace occupations, and sabotage as part of their
revolutionary industrial unionism.

### Anti-Globalization Movement

Anti-globalization activists forced the Seattle WTO Ministerial
Conference of 1999 to end early via direct action tactics and
prefigurative politics.[^10] This represented a resurgence of anarchist
organizing methods and inspired a new generation of activists globally.

### Environmental Action

Groups like Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front use
property destruction, arson, and sabotage while maintaining these acts
are nonviolent as they target property rather than living beings.[^11]

In recent years, direct action has increasingly been used to oppose the
fossil fuel industry, oil drilling, pipelines, and gas power plant
projects.[^12]

### Anti-War Resistance

Direct action was taken at arms factories in the United States and the
United Kingdom that supplied arms to Israel during the Gaza
war.[^13][^14]

Human rights activists have used direct action in the campaign to close
the School of the Americas, with 245 SOA Watch protestors collectively
spending almost 100 years in prison.[^15]

## Tactics

Direct action encompasses a wide range of tactics that bypass
traditional political channels:

### Economic Direct Action

- Strikes and general strikes
- Workplace occupations
- Boycotts
- Counter-economics and agorism
- Tax resistance

### Physical Intervention

- Blockades and lockdowns[^16]
- Tree-sitting[^17]
- Occupation of buildings and spaces
- Tunneling to prevent evictions[^18]

### Symbolic Actions

- Banner drops
- Culture jamming and subvertising
- Hacktivism

### Property Destruction

While controversial within activist movements, some groups engage in:

- Sabotage and ecotage
- Tree spiking
- Arson against corporate or state property

## Violent vs Nonviolent Direct Action

### Nonviolent Direct Action

Nonviolent direct action has been championed by figures like Mahatma
Gandhi, whose satyagraha campaigns targeted unjust laws like the salt
tax,[^19] and Martin Luther King Jr., who felt the goal was to "create
such a crisis and foster such a tension" as to demand a response.[^20]

Gene Sharp defined nonviolent direct action as "those methods of
protest, resistance, and intervention without physical violence in which
the members of the nonviolent group do, or refuse to do, certain
things."[^21]

### Insurrectionary Approaches

Insurrectionary anarchists advocate for coordinated militant action by
decentralized cell networks, seeing the state as unreformable and
requiring forceful opposition.[^22] They largely reject mass grassroots
organizations in favor of immediate attack on state and capitalist
infrastructure.

Voltairine de Cleyre wrote that violent direct action utilizes physical,
injurious force against people or, occasionally, property.[^23]

## Organization and Support

### Affinity Groups

Direct action is typically organized through decentralized affinity
groups - small autonomous collectives based on trust and shared
political affinity. These groups coordinate through spokescouncils while
maintaining operational security.

### Legal Support

Direct action groups form legal teams to support arrested activists,
addressing interactions with law enforcement, judges, and courts.[^24]

### Security Culture

Participants often use security culture practices including:

- Black bloc tactics - wearing black clothing and face coverings to
  protect identities[^25]
- Operational security and encrypted communications
- Compartmentalized planning

## Effectiveness and Debate

The "activist's dilemma" describes the challenge that "activists must
choose between moderate actions that are largely ignored and more
extreme actions that succeed in gaining attention, but may be
counterproductive to their aims."[^26]

Research shows that while radical activism has been effective in
movements like civil rights,[^27] forceful environmental sabotage can
have "negative impact on voter attitudes toward all environmental
organizations."[^28]

In the United Kingdom, polls show two-thirds of respondents support
non-violent environmental direct action, while a similar percentage
believe defacing art or monuments should be criminalized.[^29]

## Theoretical Foundations

Direct action embodies several key anarchist principles:

- **Prefigurative Politics**: Creating the new world in the shell of the
  old by modeling horizontal, non-hierarchical forms of organization
- **Propaganda of the Deed**: Demonstrating possibilities through action
  rather than just words
- **Self-Liberation**: The belief that freedom cannot be granted but
  must be taken
- **Mutual Aid**: Collective action based on solidarity rather than
  charity
