# South Carolina Commune

The **South Carolina Commune** was a revolutionary Black-led government
that controlled South Carolina from 1868 to 1874 during the
Reconstruction era following the U.S. Civil War. Characterized by W.E.B.
Du Bois as implementing more radical reforms than the famous

and "<a   href="anti-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">"anti-capitalism</a> represents one of the most
significant but overlooked examples of anarchist principles in American
history.

As anarchist political scientist Joel Olson observed: "The Black-led
Reconstruction government in South Carolina from 1868-1874, which Du
Bois dubbed the 'South Carolina Commune,' did far more toward building
socialism than the Paris Commune in 1871 ever did."[^1]

## Overview

The South Carolina Commune emerged from the revolutionary upheaval of
the post-Civil War period, when newly freed enslaved people seized
control of political and economic institutions to build an alternative
society based on "<a   href="racial_equality.md" class="wikilink"
title="racial equality">"racial equality</a>,
"<a   href="economic_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic democracy">"economic democracy</a>, and
"<a   href="community_self-governance.md" class="wikilink"
title="community self-governance">"community self-governance</a>. While
operating within the framework of Reconstruction government, the
movement was fundamentally driven by grassroots

"<a   href="mutual_aid_societies.md" class="wikilink"
title="mutual aid societies">"mutual aid societies</a>.

The commune implemented radical reforms including land redistribution to
over 14,000 Black families, creation of the South's first public
education system, universal healthcare programs, and legislation banning
racial discrimination - achievements that went far beyond the demands of
the contemporaneous Paris Commune.[^2]

Confederate General Albert Pike had warned that Black suffrage would
create "a hell on earth, a hideous, horrid pandemonium filled with all
the devils of vice, crime, pauperism, corruption, violence, political
debauchery, social anarchy."[^3] Pike was correct about one thing - the
extension of liberty to African Americans did foster "social anarchy" in
the best sense, creating a revolutionary transformation of Southern
society.

## Historical Context

### Economic Foundation of Slavery

By 1820, cotton had become "the dominant driver of US economic growth,"
with cotton jumping from 14 percent to 42 percent of total U.S. exports
in the following two decades.[^4] This expansion was built on the
"pushing system" under slavery, where productivity per enslaved person
increased by almost 400 percent from 1819 to 1860 through systematic
brutalization.

The economic importance of slavery meant that its abolition represented
a direct attack on American capitalism. As slavery defender James
Hammond argued in 1845: "do you imagine you could prevail on us to give
up a thousand millions of dollars in the value of our slaves and a
thousand millions of dollars more in the depreciation of our lands."[^5]

### The General Strike

According to W.E.B. Du Bois, a turning point in the Civil War was a
"general strike" of enslaved people who fled their masters and joined
the Union Army. This strike "decided the war" in the North's favor, with
some half a million enslaved people escaping bondage.[^6]

As Kevin van Meter notes: "For the duration of the Civil War, slaves
launched insurrections, sabotaged farm implements, set storehouses
ablaze, and fled to join the Union Army. Escaped slaves based in maroon
communities waged guerilla warfare."[^7]

This mass resistance represented one of the largest
"<a   href="general_strikes.md" class="wikilink"
title="general strikes">"general strikes</a> in history and demonstrated
the revolutionary potential of coordinated direct action.

### Reconstruction Act of 1867

The 1867 Reconstruction Act divided the South into five military
districts, with federal troops protecting Black political participation.
This created space for revolutionary organizing, though the movement's
dependence on federal protection would ultimately prove its weakness.

## Revolutionary Vision and Practice

### Anti-Capitalist Economics

According to Du Bois, South Carolina's Black residents consciously
desired "to rid themselves of the dominion of private capital."[^8]
While this didn't mean rejecting all market activity, their vision
centered on "<a   href="self-sufficiency.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-sufficiency">"self-sufficiency</a>,
"<a   href="collective_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="collective ownership">"collective ownership</a>, and economic
arrangements that prioritized human dignity over profit.

As historian Tera Hunter explains, freedom to Reconstruction-era Blacks
"meant the reestablishment of lost family connections, the achievement
of liberty, the exercise of political rights, and the security of a
decent livelihood without the sacrifice of human dignity or
self-determination."[^9]

At South Carolina's constitutional convention, Black delegate R.C.
Delarge called for the government to buy land and distribute it to
landless Black families - a demand for massive wealth redistribution
that challenged the foundations of capitalist property relations.[^10]

### Direct Democracy and Community Control

The South Carolina Commune was fundamentally a
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a> movement rather than simply electoral politics. Even Black
legislators like Alfred Grey in Alabama called for armed resistance: "I
may go to hell, my home is hell, but the white man shall go there with
me...And every one come in and bring your guns and stand up for your
rights!"[^11]

As Noel Ignatiev remarks, such speeches by landless legislators signify
"that we are no longer talking about a bourgeois parliament."[^12]

For the first time, Southern Blacks controlled their own churches and
schools. Before the Civil War, all Southern churches had white pastors
and Black congregants sat in back rows. During Reconstruction, Blacks
formed their own churches with Black leadership, and by the end of
Reconstruction the vast majority had left white-controlled
institutions.[^13]

### Revolutionary Education

Black communities made education explicitly liberatory and
anti-authoritarian. In Georgia, African Americans successfully lobbied
to change the education department's name to the "Georgia Equal Rights
and Educational Association."[^14]

Records from schools show teachers encouraging students to question
authority and understand economic exploitation:

**TEACHER**: Now children, you don't think white people are any better
than you because they have straight hair and white faces?

**STUDENTS**: No, sir.

**TEACHER**: No, they are no better, but they are different, they
possess great power, they formed this great government, they control
this vast country...Now what makes them different from you?

**STUDENTS**: Money!

**TEACHER**: Yes, but what enabled them to obtain it? How did they get
money?

**STUDENTS**: Got it off us, stole it of we all![^15]

## Achievements and Reforms

### Land Redistribution

The South Carolina government distributed land to over 14,000 Black
families, representing a massive transfer of wealth from former
slaveowners to the previously enslaved.[^16] This went far beyond the
unfulfilled promise of "40 acres and a mule" to create actual economic
democracy.

Unable to rely entirely on government action, Blacks also seized land
directly. They expropriated land from former masters' estates and
occupied unused or abandoned land. In other cases, they pooled money
together and collectively bought farms.[^17]

### Universal Public Services

The South Carolina Commune created the South's first public education
system - an achievement that the Paris Commune only talked about. They
also provided healthcare assistance, built institutions for the deaf and
disabled, and established comprehensive social services.[^18]

As South Carolinian Thomas Miller later described: "We were eight years
in power. We had built schoolhouses, established charitable
institutions, built and maintained the penitentiary system, provided for
the education of the deaf and dumb, rebuilt the jails and courthouses,
rebuilt the bridge and reestablished the ferries."[^19]

### Civil Rights Legislation

A century ahead of its time, the South Carolina government banned racial
discrimination in public places, though enforcement remained
inconsistent due to white resistance.[^20]

## Direct Action and Mutual Aid

### Worker Organization

The commune was supported by extensive worker organizing and
"<a   href="strike.md" class="wikilink" title="strike">"strike</a> activity. In
1876, farm workers in Colleton County went on strike and threatened to
destroy planters' crops. In Buford County, 200 Black rice farmers went
on strike, locked scabs in outhouses, and "overpowered a sheriff and his
posse."[^21]

In urban areas, Black women workers quit demeaning jobs, went on strike,
and formed cooperative networks. In Jackson in 1866, Black female
laundry workers struck for higher wages. The same year in Galveston,
Black women struck against unfair pay and confinement to household
work.[^22]

### Mutual Aid Networks

Reconstruction-era African Americans created thousands of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
groups including burial societies, debating clubs, drama societies, and
trade associations.[^23] In Atlanta, Blacks pooled funds and built a
hospital.[^24]

These groups offered "social fellowship, sickness and funeral benefits,
and, most of all, a chance to manage their own affairs."[^25] Often
mutual aid was informal - people simply helped friends and family
survive and resist.

### Self-Defense

With police forces dominated by whites and often allied with the Ku Klux
Klan, Black communities organized their own defense. Police led white
mobs in four days of violence in Memphis in 1866, killing 46 Blacks.
Police led one-third of the South's riots during Reconstruction.[^26]

The Klan "was rarely active where black people were in a majority and
prepared to defend themselves. In the case of white supremacy, the Klan
usually attacked those who could not defend themselves."[^27] Community
self-defense proved more effective than relying on state protection.

### Tax Resistance

In 1865, hundreds of Blacks in South Carolina refused to pay taxes to
the state government, demonstrating resistance to state authority even
when that state was nominally under their control.[^28]

## Contradictions and Limitations

### Dependence on Federal Protection

The commune's greatest weakness was its dependence on federal military
protection. This created a contradiction between the movement's
transformative vision and reliance on a conservative federal government
that ultimately betrayed Southern Blacks.

President Andrew Johnson "vetoed bills to help Negroes; he made it easy
for Confederate states to come back into the Union without guaranteeing
equal rights to blacks."[^29] With the Compromise of 1877, the U.S.
withdrew troops from the South and Reconstruction collapsed.

### Gender Limitations

The movement's vision of liberation sometimes stopped short of women's
liberation. Black male leaders "emphasized women's responsibility for
making the home 'a place of peace and comfort' for men and urged them to
submit to their husband's authority."[^30]

However, the movement also had powerful women leaders, including South
Carolina's Rollins sisters who advocated women's suffrage, and women
played crucial roles in strikes, mutual aid networks, and community
organizing.[^31]

### Criminal Justice Contradictions

While Reconstruction governments reduced punishments for many crimes,
they also built new prisons that were used in the convict lease system
to put many Blacks back into slave-like conditions.

## Legacy and Lessons

### Lack of Solidarity

A crucial factor in Reconstruction's collapse was the lack of solidarity
from Northern leftists and anarchists. As Noel Ignatiev writes:
"Apparently, American Internationalists were able to look across the
ocean to the Paris Commune, but could not cast their eyes southward to
the South Carolina Commune."[^32]

This failure of solidarity is a recurring theme in anarchist history -
similar to Mexican anarchists failing to unite with Zapatistas, Spanish
anarchists failing to unite with Moroccans, or Israeli kibbutzim
aligning with Zionist colonizers over Palestinian resisters.

### Revolutionary Potential

Despite its limitations, the South Carolina Commune demonstrated that
revolutionary transformation is possible even within the world's most
hierarchical societies. As Du Bois observed, Reconstruction was "a
revolution comparable to the upheavals in France in the past, and in
Russia, Spain, India, and China today."[^33]

The commune showed that: - Oppressed peoples can seize control of
political and economic institutions -
"<a   href="Mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="Mutual aid">"Mutual aid</a>
and
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a> can create alternative social relations - Land redistribution
and wealth transfer are achievable through organized struggle -
Community control of education and social services works better than
state bureaucracy - "<a   href="Self-defense.md" class="wikilink"
title="Self-defense">"Self-defense</a> and autonomous organization
provide better protection than police

### Contemporary Relevance

The South Carolina Commune's example remains relevant for contemporary
movements like "<a   href="Black_Lives_Matter.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Lives Matter">"Black Lives Matter</a>, which often employ
horizontal organization,
"<a   href="direct_action.md" class="wikilink" title="direct action">"direct
action</a>, and radical critiques of existing society. The commune
demonstrates that revolutionary change is possible when movements
combine electoral participation with grassroots organizing, mutual aid,
and direct action.

As Max Shachtman noted, the commune's limitations came not from its
radical vision but from the constraints of operating within a capitalist
system and dependence on bourgeois allies who ultimately abandoned the
movement.[^34]

## Significance for Anarchist Theory

The South Carolina Commune provides crucial lessons for anarchist theory
and practice:

### Prefigurative Politics

The commune demonstrated
"<a   href="prefigurative_politics.md" class="wikilink"
title="prefigurative politics">"prefigurative politics</a> by creating
the kind of society anarchists envision - one based on
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>,
"<a   href="direct_democracy.md" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">"direct democracy</a>, economic equality, and
community self-governance - rather than waiting for revolution to create
these conditions.

### Intersectional Analysis

The commune shows how struggles against racial oppression, economic
exploitation, and state authority are interconnected. Its
anti-capitalist vision emerged directly from the experience of racial
slavery and the need to prevent its reimposition.

### Revolutionary Strategy

The commune's combination of electoral participation, direct action,
mutual aid, and community organizing provides a model for revolutionary
strategy that doesn't rely solely on either reform or insurrection.

### Solidarity and Coalition

The commune's collapse demonstrates the importance of solidarity between
different oppressed groups and the dangers of isolation. Contemporary
anarchist movements must learn from the failure of Northern leftists to
support this revolutionary experiment.

The South Carolina Commune stands as proof that anarchist principles can
work on a large scale and create dramatic improvements in people's
lives, even under the most difficult conditions. Its example challenges
both reformist and revolutionary strategies while pointing toward the
possibility of fundamental social transformation.
