The Black Panther Party for Self Defense was founded in 1966 by Black
college students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in California. On 15 June
1969, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover called the Black Panther Party “the
greatest threat to internal security of the country.”[^1] The party had
45 branches and sold a quarter-million newspapers a week at their
peak.[^2] A 1970 poll found some two thirds of African Americans admired
the Panthers.[^3]

Although the BPP was officially Maoist, and heavily influenced by
Malcolm X and Frantz Fanon, its commitments to community control and
direct action led the social ecologist John Clark to observe “radically
decentralist and anarchistic dimensions” in the party's organizing.[^4]
BPP members had direct ties to Anarchism before, during, and after the
party's existence.

BPP co-founder Huey Newton explained that in his pre-Panther days, he
"fell in love with Bakunin and Nechayev's Catechism of the
Revolutionist," and his autobiography praised Bakunin as speaking for
the <a href="International_Workers&#39;_Association" class="wikilink"
title="First International">First International</a>'s most militant
wing.[^5]

The anarchist <a href="San_Francisco_Diggers" class="wikilink"
title="San Francisco Diggers">San Francisco Diggers</a> printed the
first issues of the BPP's newspaper, and BPP member David Hillard says
these anarchists' free grocery service inspired the Panthers' famous
Free Breakfast Program.[^6] In 1968, when the BPP's Eldridge cleaver ran
for president under the Peace and Freedom Party, he selected Jerry
Rubin, a member of the anarchistic
<a href="Yippies" class="wikilink" title="Yippies">Yippies</a>, as his
running mate.[^7]

Several former Black Panthers - including Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, Ashanti
Alston, and Kuwasi Balagoon - became self-identified Anarchists later
on, and another, Russell Maroon Shoatz, went on to support an entirely
anarchist theory without actually adopting the identity.[^8]

The section on “Political Prisoners” has information on how to write to
and support Black Panthers who are currently incarcerated.

# Ideology and Structure

According to political prisoner and former BPP member Mumia Abu-Jamal,
most Black Panthers were much more familiar with the speeches of Malcolm
X than they were with Chairman Mao's Red Book. “\[T\]he Black Panther
Party was a Malcolmist party far more than it was a Marxist one,”
Abu-Jamal recounts.[^9]

Isolated from the party's grassroots beliefs, a smaller handful of
leaders, including undercover FBI informant Richard Aoki, shaped the
party's official Marxist-Leninist ideology. Aoki claimed to have
contributed, “\[t\]he Maoist twist, I kind of threw that one in. I said
so far the most advanced Marxists I have run across are the Maoists in
China."[^10]

Despite having a Marxist-Leninist ideology, the Black Panther Party was
not especially influenced by the USSR's domestic or foreign policies. In
fact, Huey Newton made a speech in 1970 that rejected Stalin's belief in
"socialism in one country."[^11]

At least initially, the Black Panther Party advocated the establishment
of a socialist, Black nation-state independent from the United State of
America.[^12] However, Newton's 1970 speech disavowed nationalism in
favor of a "revolutionary intercommunalism." He said that Blacks in the
United States were by that point not a nation but a "collection of
communities."[^13]

In the past decades, some Black Panthers have since became Anarchists,
especially when in prison and facing the most extensive brutalities of
the State head on. These Panthers have come to criticize the Party's
hierarchical organization. According to Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, the BPP
“partially failed because of the authoritarian leadership style of Huey
P. Newton, Bobby Seale and others on the Central Committee.”[^14]

The Panthers had a Ten-Point Program that emphasized community control
of the economy and police, workplace self-management, cooperative
housing, and communal health care.[^15]

# Survival Programs and Community Control

The Black Panthers had members in more than forty cities across the
United States. Almost every chapter or branch had a Free Breakfast for
Children program, a health clinic, and a free clothing program.[^16]
Huey Newton said Panthers described these initiatives as “survival
programs pending revolution.”[^17] These programs constituted direct
action, offering services to communities that capitalists and the State
were not offering. Panther David Hillard credited the anarchist
<a href="San_Francisco_Diggers" class="wikilink"
title="San Francisco Diggers">San Francisco Diggers</a>' free grocery
service with inspiring the BPP's Free Breakfast program,[^18] which in
turn would help propel the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.[^19]

Some BPP chapters had liberation schools, which each week offered
children free breakfasts and lunches, three days of classes, and three
days of films and field trips. Adult education courses were offered in
the evenings.[^20]

Panthers set up patrols to follow the police, armed with tape records,
cameras, law books, and guns.[^21] The party proposed that the police
should be controlled by elected neighborhood councils which would have
the ability to discipline the police and recall commissioners at any
time.. Members of the neighborhood could recall council members.[^22]

scott crow, a Texas-based Anarchist who collaborated with former Panther
Malik Rahim to set up survival programs in New Orleans after Hurricane
Katrina hit in 2005[^23], reflects on the impact of the BPP's historic
survival programs:

> What frightened the state so much about the programs run by Panthers?
> It was that they advocated that people take power into their own hands
> through food programs, educating themselves, and defending their
> communities from police assaults and harassment. If they had been an
> unarmed church group, no one would have paid attention' but they were
> offering underserved communities tools for creating dignity and
> self-determination in the face of oppression.[^24]

# Rainbow Coalition

In the fall of 1968, the Illinois Black Panthers partnered with the
Young Patriots (a white working class group) to form the Rainbow
Coalition. The Young Lords (an organization of Puerto Ricans) then
joined. The Panthers' Fred Hampton named the coalition and took a
leading role in organizing it. The multi-racial working class
organization energized Chicago's grassroots, and it also appeared to
frighten authorities. That December, the police murdered Hampton, as
discussed later in this article.[^25] Other Rainbow Coalition members
included the
<a href="American_Indian_Movement_and_Anarchy" class="wikilink"
title="American Indian Movement">American Indian Movement</a>, and
Chicano Crusade for Justice.[^26]

# Women in the Party

BPP member Safiya Bukhari-Alston recalled that women held leadership
positions on every level of the Party and that the Party adopted
anti-sexism policies which in practice were sometimes followed and other
times ignored:

> In its brief history (1966-1973) of seven years women had been
> involved on every level in the Black Panther Party. There were women,
> like Audrea Jones, who founded the Boston Chapter of the Black Panther
> Party, women like Brenda Hyson, who was the OD (Officer of the Day) in
> the Brooklyn Chapter of the Black Panther Party, women like Peaches,
> who fought side by side with Geronimo Pratt in the Southern California
> Chapter of the Black Panther Party, Kathleen Cleaver who was in the
> Central Committee, and Sister Rivera who was one of the motivators
> behind the office in Mt. Vernon, NY. By the same token there were
> problems with men who brought their sexist attitudes into the
> organization. Men who refused to take direction (orders) from women,
> and we had a framework established to deal with that but because of
> liberalism and cowardice, as well as fear, a lot of times the
> framework was not utilized.[^27]

Afeni Shakur (later famous as the mother of rapper Tupac Shakur) took on
a leadership poisition in the Party's Harlem branch. Shakur recalled,
“When I first met Sekou \[Odinga\] and Lumumba \[Shakur\] it was the
first time in my life that I ever met men who didn't abuse women. As
simple as that. It had nothing to do with anything about political
movements. It was just that never in my life had I met men who didn't
abuse women, and who loved women because they were women and because
they were people.”[^28]

According to former Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, “the Black Panther Party,
for ideological reasons and for reasons of sheer survival, gave the
women of the BPP far more opportunities to lead and to influence the
organization than any of its contemporaries, in white or Black radical
formations.”[^29]

# Black Liberation Army

An underground group comprised largely of former BPP members, the Black
Liberation Army conducted guerilla actions including bank expropriations
and attempted jailbreaks. While the Army espoused a hierarchical
Marxist-Leninist ideology, in practice it conducted actions in a
decentralized manner through autonomous cells.[^30]

The *Wikipedia* page on the Black Liberation Army discusses an
“Anarchist turn” among members of the Black Liberation Army: “Following
the collapse of the BLA, some members - including Ashanti Alston, Donald
Weems (a.k.a. Kuwasi Balagoon) and Ojore N. Lutalo - became outspoken
proponents of anarchism.[^31]

# State Repression

In November 1968, the FBI's director J. Edgar Hoover called on FBI field
agents “to exploit all avenues of creating...dissension within the ranks
of the BPP.”[^32]

The FBI's Counter Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, took 233 actions
against the Black Panther Party.[^33] These operations included a range
of tactics from spreading false rumors about certain Panthers being
snitches, to making up evidence, to conducting outright assasinations of
Panthers.

## Bad-jacketing

Some COINTELPRO actions involved bad-jacketing, meaning the spread of
false rumors that certain Panthers were snitches. A COINTELPRO document
from 10 July 1968 proposed “convey\[ing\] the impression that \[SNCC
leader and BPP Honorary Prime Minister Stokley\] CHARMICHAEL is a CIA
informer.”[^34] Later, the Black Panthers' Minister of Defense Huey P.
Newton began denoucning Charmicahel. On 5 September 1970, Newton
proclaimed, “We...charge that Stokley Charmichael is operating as an
agent of the CIA.”[^35]

In another instance, the FBI spread a rumor in 1969 that a Panther named
Fred Bennett was a police informant. Other Panthers killed Bennett and
cremated the body. In the study *Agents of Repression: The FBI's Secret
Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement*,
authors Churchill and Vander Wall comment that this outcome demonstrates
bad-jacketing's “leathal implications.”[^36]

## Fabricating evidence

Other COINTELPRO operations involved the fabrication of evidence. The
FBI trained bogus witnesses to testify in the Chicago Eight trial
involving the Panthers' Bobby Seale. The FBI also sent a fake
threatening letter to jurors signed as “the Black Panthers.”[^37]

## Assassinations

COINTELPRO even resorted to outright assassinations. At 4:30 AM on 4
December 1969, FBI agents broke into the Black Panther Fred Hampton's
apartment in Chicago and shot three Black Panthers. The raid left Brenda
Harris injured and Mark Clark and Fred Hampton dead. The only shot fired
by the Panthers during the raid was one reflexively fired by Clark after
he had already been shot by federal agents.[^38]

The targeting of Hampton was likely a response to Hampton's demonstrated
skill at community organizing and ability to work effectively with
people across cultural boundaries. Hampton helped influence a Puerto
Rican street gang to form the Young Lords Party. He collaborated with
apolitical black gangs, Asians, Mexicans, poor whites, and others.[^39]

# The Split and Decline

A split between Black Panther Party leaders Huey Newton and Eldridge
Cleaver effectively tore apart the party. The split came about, first of
all, because of the intense campaign of state repression directed
against the party. The FBI wrote fabricated letters to party leaders
with the attempt of driving a wedge between them. For instance, one
FBI-written letter, allegedly by the Panther Elbert Howard, addressed
the BPP's Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver and accused BPP
Minister of Defense Huey Newton of lying to him about the use of Party
funds.[^40] In 1971, the split between Cleaver and Newton went public
when they disputed each other during a television call-in show. On the
air, Newton called Cleaver a “punk” and “coward.”[^41]

Mumia Abu-Jamal claims that the party's hierarchical structure allowed
it to be more easily destroyed by the FBI's divide-and-conquer attempts.

> Despite the ideological claim that the Party functioned under the
> principle of criticism and self-criticism, the Party hierarchy in fact
> functioned much like any other group in bourgeois society, that is,
> according to the principle of power dynamics: those who have power
> strive mightily to keep it-period.
>
> So when Huey received letters full of criticism of his leader­ ship, he
> struck out at those he thought were angling to undermine his rule of
> the organization. When Eldridge received letters critical of Huey's
> leadership, he felt a sense of affirmation. Neither appar­ ently
> questioned the authorship of this critical correspondence. [^42]

Moreover, the party's Central Committee, under Newton's influence, made
decisions alienating to some rank-and-file Panthers. One such directive
asked Panthers around the country to close down survival programs and
come to Oakland to work on Bobby Seale's mayoral campaign. According to
Abu-Jamal, this order led to many defections and gave the impression
that the organization was in decline:

> The order meant that Panthers from across the country had to close
> their local offices, close their local com­munity survival programs,
> and, essentially, leave for Oakland. For some Panthers, this was
> simply unacceptable. Many people left the Party.[^43]

Russell Maroon Shoatz argues that the U.S. government, by letting Huey
Newton leave jail despite pending charges for allegedly killing a cop,
and thereby keeping him on a "short leash," encouraged Newton to drive
the party in a reformist and "gangster" direction:

> Newton continued to use his iconic stature and renewed direct control
> of his faction again to play the cool-political-gangster role; and
> like any drug addict who refuses to reform, he kept sliding downhill,
> even turning on old comrades and his main champion, Elaine Brown, who
> had to flee in fear.
>
> Sadly, for all practical purposes, that was the end of the original
> Black Panther Party.
>
> Check-mate!
>
> Later, as is well-known, Newton’s continued drug addiction cost him
> his life, a sorry ending for a once great man.[^44]

According to Anarchist and former Panther Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, the BPP
“partially failed because of the authoritarian leadership style" of the
Central Committee. Ervin elaborates:

> "Because of the over-importance of central leadership, the national
> organization was ultimately liquidated entirely, packed up and shipped
> back to Oakland, California. Of course, many errors were made because
> the BPP was a young organization and was under intense attack by the
> state. I do not want to imply that the internal errors were the
> primary contradictions that destroyed the BPP. The police attacks on
> it did that, but, if it were better and more democratically organized,
> it may have weathered the storm."[^45]

# Huey Newton and Anarchism

Despite his praise for Bakunin (described above), the BPP's co-founder
and Minister of Defense Huey Newton wrote an article criticizing
anarchism as lacking organization and being too individualist:

> In this country the anarchists seem to feel that if they just express
> themselves individually and tend to ignore the limitations imposed on
> them, without leadership and without discipline they can oppose the
> very disciplined, organized reactionary state. This is not true. They
> will be oppressed as long as imperialism exists.[^46]

Murray Bookchin responded that Anarchists emphasize organization while
insisting on autonomy and horizontal structures:

> I don't know who Huey is arguing with when he speaks of "anarchists"
> who believe all they have to do is "just express themselves
> individually" in order to achieve freedom. Tim Leary? Allen Ginzberg?
> The Beatles? Certainly not the revolutionary anarchist communists I
> know -- and I know a large and fairly representative number.[^47]

# Political Prisoners

For up-to-date addresses and information on how to write to and support
incarcerated Panthers and other prisoners, see NYC Anarchist Black
Cross's *Illustrated Guide to Political Prisoners and Prisoners of
War*.[^48] The following descriptions are quoted from this guide. The
guide also includes links to websites of relevant prisoner support
campaigns.

## Mumia Abu-Jamal

Birthday: April 24

“Mumia is an award winning journalist and was one of the founders of the
Black Panther Party chapter in Philadelphia, PA. He has struggled for
justice and human rights for people of color since he was at least 14
years old ~ the age when he joined the Party. In December of 1982,
Mumia, who moonlighted by driving a taxi, happened upon police who were
beating his brother. During the melee, a police officer was shot and
killed. Despite the fact that many people saw someone else shoot and
then runaway from the scene, Mumia, in what could only be called a
kangaroo court, was convicted and sentenced to death. During the summer
of 1995, a death warrant was signed by Governor Tom Ridge, which sparked
one of the most effective organizing efforts in defense of a political
prisoner ever. Since that time, Mumia has had his death sentence
overturned, but still has a life sentence with no opportunity for
parole.”

## Sundiata Acoli

Birthday: January 14

“A New York Black Panther, he endured two years of prison awaiting trial
for the Panther 21 Conspiracy Case. He and his comrades were eventually
acquitted on all the bogus charges.

The case was historic and a classic example of police and government
attempting to neutralize organizations by incarcerating their
leadership. As a result of this political attack and because of the
immense pressure and surveillance from the FBI and local police
Sundiata, like many other Panther leaders went 'underground'. On May 2,
1973, Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ambushed and
attacked by state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike. Assata was
wounded and Zayd was killed. During the gun battle a state trooper was
shot and killed in self defense. Sundiata was tried in an environment of
mass hysteria and convicted, although there was no credible evidencethat
he killed the trooper or had been involved in the shooting. He was
sentenced to thirty years. Sundiata was ordered released on parole by a
state appeals court in New Jersey in September 2014 when the court ruled
the parole board had 'acted arbitrarily and capriciously' when it
previously denied him parole. The State of New Jersey has appealed the
decision.”

## Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin

Birthday: October 4

“Formerly known as H. Rap Brown, the Imam came to prominence in the
1960s as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and
the Justice Minister of the Black Panther Party. He is perhaps most
famous for his proclamation during that period that 'violence is as
American as cherry pie', as well as once stating that 'If America don’t
come around, we’re gonna burn it down.' He is currently serving a life
sentence for homicide.”

## Zolo Azania

Birthday: December 12

“Zolo Azania is a former Black Panther convicted of a 1981 bank robbery
that left a Gary, Indiana cop dead. He was arrested miles away from the
incident as he was walking, unarmed, down the street. The prosecution
intimidated witnesses, suppressed favorable evidence, presented false
eyewitness and expert testimony, and denied him the right to speak or
present motions in his own behalf.”

## Herman Bell

Birthday: January 14

“Herman Bell moved to Brooklyn as a boy. He was a talented football
player and won ascholarship to UC-Oakland. While in Oakland, Herman
joined the Black Panther Party and became active around human rights
issues in the Black community. In 1971, due to relentless FBI attacks on
the Party, Herman went underground. While underground, Herman joined the
Black Liberation Army, and in September of 1973 he was captured and
extradited to New York on charges of having killed 2 New York City
police officers—a case for which other Panthers were serving time. No
witnesses were able to put Herman at the scene of the crime. The first
trial ended in a hung jury, but Herman was convicted at his second trial
and sentenced to 25 years to life. In 1990, he earned his B.S. degree
from the SUNY-New Paltz. Herman remains a prison activist, having
coached sports teams inside the prison system, as well as mentoring
younger prisoners. His next parole hearing is scheduled for 2016.”

## Joe-Joe Bowen

Birthday: January 15

“Joseph 'Joe-Joe' Bowen is one of the many all-but-forgotten frontline
soldiers in the liberation struggle. A native of Philadelphia, Joe-Joe
was a young member of the '30th and Norris' street gang before his
incarceration politicized him. Released in 1971, his outside activism
was cut short a week following his release when Joe-Joe was confronted
by an officer of the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police department.
The police officer was killed in the confrontation, and Bowen fled.
After his capture and incarceration, Bowen became a Black Liberation
Army combatant, defiant to authorities at every turn. In 1973, Joe-Joe
and Philadelphia Five prisoner Fred 'Muhammad' Burton assassinated
Holmesberg prison’s warden and deputy warden as well as wounded the
guard commander in retaliation for intense repression against Muslim
prisoners in the facility. In 1981, Bowen led a six-day standoff with
authorities when he and six other captives took 39 hostages at
Graterford Prison as a freedom attempt and protest of the prison
conditions. Much of his time in prison has been spent in and out of
control units, solitary confinement, and other means of isolating
Joe-Joe from the general prison population. These include three trips to
Marion Penitentiary, where he met Sundiata Acoli and other BLA members.
He is legendary to many prisoners as a revolutionary. 'I used to teach
the brothers how to turn their rage into energy and understand their
situations,' Bowen told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1981. 'I don’t
threaten anybody. I don’t talk to pigs. I don’t drink anything I can’t
see through and I don’t eat anything off a tray. When the time comes,
I’ll be ready.'

## Veronza Bowers, Jr.

Birthday: February 4

“Veronza was a member of the Black Panther Party and was convicted in
the murder of a U.S. Park Ranger on the word of two government
informants, both of whom received reduced sentences for other crimes by
the Federal prosecutor’s office. There were no eye-witnesses and no
evidence independent of these informants to link him to the crime. At
his trial, Veronza offered alibi testimony which was not credited by the
jury. Nor was testimony of two relatives of the informants who insisted
that they were lying. The informants had all charges against them in
this case dropped and one was given \$10,000 by the government according
to the prosecutor’s post-sentencing report. Veronza has consistently
proclaimed his innocence of the crime he never committed, even at the
expense of having his appeals for parole denied for which an admission
of guilt and contrition is virtually required. He insists on maintaining
his innocence.”

## Chip Fitzgerald

Birthday: April 11

“Romaine 'Chip' Fitzgerald, born and raised in Compton, California,
joined the Southern California Chapter of the Black Panther Party in
early 1969 as a teenager who had just been released from the California
Youth Authority. In September of that year, as a dedicated member of the
Party, Chip was arrested in connection with a police shoot-out and tried
for assault on police and related charges, including the murder of a
security guard. He was sentenced to death.”

## Robert Seth Hayes

Birthday: October 15

“After the assassination of Martin Luther King and the social upheaval
which followed it, Robert Seth Hayes joined the Black Panther Party,
working in the Party’s free medical clinics and free breakfast programs.
Like many other activists, Seth was forced underground by FBI and police
repression of the Panther movement. Once underground, Seth joined the
Black Liberation Army. In 1973, following a shootout with police, Seth
was arrested and convicted of the murder of a New York City police
officer, and, while maintaining his innocence to this day, sentenced to
25 years to life in prison. Imprisoned for nearly forty years, Seth has
long since served his sentence. Seth first came up for parole in 1998,
but prison officials have refused to release him, focusing on his
involvement with the Black Panther Party and his knowledge as to the
whereabouts of Assata Shakur and not his conduct while imprisoned. While
in prison, Seth has worked as a librarian, pre release advisor, and AIDS
counselor, mentoring younger prisoners and continuing to struggle for
his people.”

## Ruchell Magee

Birthday: March 17

“Commonly regarded as the longest held political prisoner in the U.S.,
Ruchell Magee has been imprisoned since 1963. He was politicized in
prison and participated in the August 7, 1970 Marin County Courthouse
Rebellion— the attempted liberation of political prisoner \[and Black
Panther\] George Jackson and the Soledad Brothers by Jackson’s younger
brother Jonathan. Magee was seriously injured in the incident and
subsequently pleaded guilty to aggravated kidnapping. He was sentenced
in 1975 to life in prison and has been denied parole numerous times.”

## Jalil Muntaqim

Birthday: October 18

“Jalil became affiliated with the Black Panther Party at age 18. Less
than 2 months before his 20th birthday he was captured with Albert Nuh
Washington in a midnight shootout with San Francisco police. He was
subsequently charged with a host of revolutionary activities including
the assassination of two police in New York City, and is currently
serving a 25 years to life sentence in New York State. His case is known
as the New York 3 case as his co-defendants include Nuh and Herman Bell.
He was also implicated in the San Francisco 8 case, and pled guilty to a
lesser offense. His next parole hearing is scheduled for 2016.”

## Kojo Bomani Sababu

“Kojo Bomani Sababu is a New Afrikan Prisoner of War, currently serving
a 55 year sentence for actions with the Black Liberation Army and
attempted prison escape with Puerto Rican Independista Oscar López
Rivera. Sababu was convicted of one count of conspiracy for an alleged
escape plan that included the use of rockets, hand grenades, and a
helicopter.”

## Kamau Sadiki

Birthday: February 19

“Kamau Sadiki is a former member of the Black Panther Party and was
convicted of a 30-year old murder case of a Fulton County Police Officer
found shot to death in his car outside a service station.”

## Dr. Mutulu Shakur

Birthday: August 8

“In 1987 Dr. Shakur was sentenced to 60 years imprisonment for his role
in the Black Liberation Movement. In March 1982, Dr. Shakur and 10
others were indicted by a federal grand jury under a set of U.S.
conspiracy laws called Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization
(RICO) laws. These conspiracy laws were ostensibly developed to aid the
government in its prosecution of organized crime figures; however, they
have been used with varying degrees of success against revolutionary
organizations. Dr. Shakur was charged with conspiracy and participation
in the Black Liberation Army, a group that carried out actual and
attempted expropriations from several banks. Eight incidents were
alleged to have occurred between December 1976 to October 1981. In
addition, he was charged with participation in the 1979 prison escape of
Assata Shakur, who is now in exile in Cuba. After five years
underground, Dr. Shakur was arrested on February 12, 1986. While he was
on the street, Dr. Shakur challenged the use of methadone as a tool of
recovery for addicts. He believed in natural remedies instead and, based
on those beliefs, founded the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of
North America. Many people credit Shakur with saving their lives. Dr.
Shakur has worked to free political prisoners and to expose government
abuses against political organizers. While in prison, he has struggled
to create peace between rival gangs.”
