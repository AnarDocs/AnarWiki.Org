## Death

Palme was shot while walking home from a cinema with his wife in
Stockholm in 1986. His killed has never been identified leading to
numerous theories about the assassination have spawned in the years
following. Although it is entirely possible that one, multiple or none
of these theories are true, it is a conclusion you will have to reach
yourself.

### Theory \#1: Arms Trafficking

It's been argued that his assassination may have been connected to the
Bofors scandal, given Palme's secret efforts to secure armanents
production contracts to sell to the
<a href="India" class="wikilink" title="Indian">Indian</a> military. The
theory suggests he was assassinated in order to stop him learning about
several corrupt elements of the deal and Swedish police hid evidence
from <a href="MI6" class="wikilink" title="MI6">MI6</a>.[^1]

### Theory \#2: CIA Involvement

According to Richard Brenneke, a man who claims to be a former
<a href="CIA" class="wikilink" title="CIA">CIA</a> agent, the CIA was
behind the assassination. This theory supports the South African Police
theory, given the close co-operation between the US and South African
government in interfering in the affairs of other states throughout the
late 20th century. <a href="Operation_Gladio#Italy" class="wikilink"
title="CIA-connected fascists in Italy">CIA-connected fascists in
Italy</a> wrote telegrams saying "the Swedish tree will be felled"
before his assassination.[^2]

### Theory \#3: Organised Crime

### Theory \#4: Iran

### Theory \#5: KGB Involvement

It has been suspected that the KGB (the intelligence arm of the
<a href="USSR" class="wikilink" title="USSR">USSR</a>) were behind the
assassination, although they possessed a motive (Palme apparently did
not follow orders from the USSR) no people associated with the KGB have
ever been connected with the case.[^3]

### Theory \#6: LaRouche Movement

At the time, Victor Gunnarsson, a member of the European Workers Party,
the Swedish branch of the <a href="LaRouche_Movement" class="wikilink"
title="LaRouche Movement">LaRouche Movement</a>, was arrested after he
matched the description and had pamphlets hostile to Palme in his home.
However, he was acquitted and eventually murdered in the
<a href="United_States_of_America" class="wikilink" title="USA">USA</a>
as part of a love triangle.[^4]

### Theory \#7: Mistaken for a Drug Dealer

Christer Pettersson, a local thief, drug addict and alcoholic was
strongly suspected in the case (originally arrested) he allegedly shot
him because he mistook Palme for a drug dealer.[^5]

### Theory \#8: Neo-Fascists

### Theory \#9: PKK Involvement

Both the Swedish police and Turkish governments have alleged the
assassination to be a product of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),
although evidence for this is lacking.[^6]

### Theory \#10: Skandia Man

### Theory \#11: South African Police

Some have suspected that the South African Police were behind the
assassination, owing to Palme's outspoken criticism of
<a href="Apartheid_(South_Africa)" class="wikilink"
title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> and public support (both diplomatic and
financial) for the
<a href="African_National_Conference" class="wikilink"
title="ANC">ANC</a> during his government. Supporters of this theory
include several former South African police, mercenaries and documentary
makers.[^7]

### Theory \#12: Rogue Swedish Police

### Theory \#13: Yugoslavia

In January 2011 the German magazine *Focus* cited official
<a href="Germany" class="wikilink" title="German">German</a>
interrogation records in connection with another investigation from 2008
as showing that the assassination had been carried out by an operative
of the <a href="Socialist_Yugoslavia" class="wikilink"
title="Yugoslavian">Yugoslavian</a> security service. The assassin is
allegedly a 65 year old Croatian man in Zagreb who works for private
security.[^8]

Sadly, his protégé and political ally,
<a href="Bernt_Carlsson" class="wikilink" title="Bernt Carlsson">Bernt
Carlsson</a>, who was appointed UN Commissioner for Namibia in July
1987, was killed in the bombing of
<a href="Pan_Am_Flight_103" class="wikilink"
title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am Flight 103</a> over Lockerbie, Scotland
on 21 December 1988 *en route* to the UN signing ceremony of the New
York Accords the following day.
