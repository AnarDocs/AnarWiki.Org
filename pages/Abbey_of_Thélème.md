16th-century François Rabelais imagined an Abbey of Thélème, a monastery
with no rules except "Do what you will." The name *Thélème* means "will"
or "pleasure" in Greek.

> The most colourful and rumbustious French libertarian was the
> incomparable François Rabelais. An ex-Franciscan and Benedictine monk
> who practised and taught medicine, Rabelais came to hate monks and
> scholasticism. In his masterpiece Gargantua and Pantagruel (1532–64)
> he delighted in satirizing the religious, political, legal and social
> institutions and practices of sixteenth-century France. The work
> contains a wonderful mixture of bawdy humour, sharp satire and zest
> for life.
>
> At the same time, there is a serious side to Rabelais. He adopted a
> form of naturalistic optimism which led him to anarchist conclusions.
> He believed that human nature is fundamentally good and only corrupted
> by our education and environment. He therefore called for the full
> development of our faculties ‘because free people, well-born and
> well-educated, keeping good company, have by nature an instinct and
> incentive which always encourage them to virtuous acts, and hold them
> back from vice.’[^1] It follows that if people are left to themselves
> their ‘honour’ or moral sense is sufficient to govern their behaviour
> without the need for any external rules or laws.
>
> Rabelais gave flesh and blood to these abstract principles in Book I
> of Gargantua and Pantagruel (1534) where he describes the founding of
> the abbey of Thélème. Gargantua gives the abbey to Friar John (Frère
> Jean des Entommeures: Friar John of the Hearty Eaters) for his help in
> the war against the power-mad despot Picrochole, who has a ‘bitter
> bile’ (the meaning of his name in Greek). Friar John has all the
> faults of monks but none of their vices. He is ignorant, dirty and
> gluttonous, but also brave, frank and lusty. His abbey is built like a
> magnificent and luxurious country house without walls, the very
> opposite of a convent or monastery. Its name Thélème in Greek means
> ‘will’ or ‘pleasure’. The gifted and well-bred members are free to
> leave whenever they choose. There is no chastity, poverty and
> obedience: they can marry, be rich, and live in perfect freedom. They
> have no need for laws and lawyers, politics, kings and princes,
> religion, preachers and monks, money and usurers. All their life is
> spent ‘not in laws, statutes or rules, but according to their own free
> will and pleasure’. The only rule is ‘fais ce que voudras!’ (Do what
> you will!).
