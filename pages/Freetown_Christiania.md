## Overview

## History

### Origins (1971)

On 26 September 1971, Christiania was declared open by Jacob Ludvigsen,
a well-known provo and journalist who published a magazine called
*Hovedbladet* ('The main paper'). Ludvigsen wrote an article exploring
what he termed 'The Forbidden City of the Military', widely announcing
the proclamation of the free town under the headline "Civilians
conquered the 'forbidden city' of the military".[^3]

The area of Christiania consists of former military barracks of
Bådsmandsstræde and parts of the city ramparts. The ramparts and the
borough of Christianshavn were established in 1617 by King Christian IV
by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and Amager.
After the siege of Copenhagen during the Second Northern War, the
ramparts were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under Christian V to form a
complete defence ring. The ramparts are today considered among the
finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.[^4]

### 1970s

Although Christiania initially enjoyed a blind eye from the authorities,
the Ministry of Defence brought a legal case against Christiania on 1
April 1976, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on 2 February 1978,
ruling that Christiania should be cleared immediately. However, despite
the ruling, immediate action was not taken and that same year the Danish
Parliament decided that a development plan should be drafted first.

The 1976 protest song "I kan ikke slå os ihjel" ("You cannot kill us"),
written by Tom Lunden of flower power rock group Bifrost, became the
unofficial anthem of Christiania.[^5]

### 1980s

In 1984, a motorcycle gang moved into Christiania and began selling hard
drugs. Residents expelled the gang using a combination of sabotage,
public meetings, pressure, and direct confrontation.[^6]

In 1989 the Danish Parliament legalised Christiania.[^7]

### 2000s

In 2005, a gang shooting killed one man and injured three others in
connection with the drug trade.

On 14 May 2007, workers from the governmental Forest and Nature Agency,
accompanied by police, entered Christiania to demolish leftovers of the
small, abandoned building of *Cigarkassen* ('the cigar box'). They were
met by angry residents who built roadblocks. The police eventually
entered the Freetown en masse and were met by resistance. Residents
threw stones and shot fireworks at police vehicles and built barricades
in the street outside Christiania's gate. The police used tear gas on
the residents and over 50 activists from both Christiania and outside
were arrested.[^8]

In 2009, a hand grenade attack at Cafe Nemoland left one person with
severe facial injuries.

### 2010s

In a communal meeting consisting of Christiania residents, it was
decided that the stalls in Pusher Street (by far the site of the largest
cannabis sale in Denmark) should be removed, which happened the
following day, 2 September 2016.[^9] Local residents also urged people
who were friends of the neighbourhood to help by not buying cannabis in
Christiania. About two months later, it was estimated that the *de
facto* practice of cannabis sales within Christiania had dropped by
about 75%.[^10]

Also in 2016, a shooting of two police officers and a civilian occurred.

### 2020s

In 2023, a shooting killed one person and injured four others.

In 2024, a large portion of the drug trade was shut down in a
collaborative effort between Danish police and the majority of the
inhabitants, with Pusher Street being physically dug up.[^11]

### Land ownership

After bitter negotiations that temporarily resulted in the area being
sealed off to the public, in June 2011, the residents of Christiania
agreed to collectively set up a fund to formally purchase the land.[^12]
The community made its first payment in July 2012, officially becoming
legal landowners. Christianites were able to buy about 19 acres of the
initial 84-acre plot, transitioning from squatters to legal property
owners through a foundation run by residents.[^13]

After the residents had squatted in Christiania for four decades,
Denmark sold the residents the land for \$13 million. Ole Lykke, a
resident and historian commented to *Vanity Fair*, "We now pay double
for half the freedom, considering the interest cost and increased rent.
We have moved into a capitalist structure. Money talks now. It's
possible for the state to keep turning the wheel on the rent and the
banks to keep making the interest higher. It will be harder and harder
for older people, disabled people, to keep a home here."[^14]

## Characteristics

### Positives

#### Decision-Making

Christiania operates as an intentional community under a consensus
democracy, where the Ting serves as the central decision-making body.
Residents make decisions by
"<a   href="consensus.md" class="wikilink" title="consensus">"consensus</a> at
community meetings held in a central building called the Ting
House.[^15]

As "<a   href="Georgy_Katsiaficas.md" class="wikilink"
title="Georgy Katsiaficas">"Georgy Katsiaficas</a> explains:

> In the Free Republic of Christiania, hundreds of people illegally live
> in an alternative community where no authority counts except that of
> the Ting, an ancient Danish form of consensual decision making. One of
> the central buildings is known as the Tinghus (Ting house). Sitting in
> a circle at meetings of the communal council, each resident may go to
> the center and speak, and decisions are made by the eventual agreement
> of all through consensus rather than a majority vote. Direct democracy
> within the Danish movement does not have to be explained - it is
> almost second nature - nor is it limited to occasional gatherings of
> political groups who use it as a formal method of decision-making.

A resident explains the community's way of resolving conflicts:

> If a problem comes up, it is first discussed in the house where it
> originates, where it hopefully will be resolved. Only if the issue is
> still not taken care of will a neighborhood meeting be called to
> discuss it. This way, the house and then the neighborhood must fail to
> deal with the problem before it becomes necessary to have a community
> meeting, and by then, most people have already heard about the matter
> and considered the various options. We never vote at community
> meetings nor do we have a council, because then some people make
> decisions for others. We only have community meetings when we need
> to - sometimes not for years, other times once a week.[^16][^17]

Different people interviewed have different conceptions of how
Christiania maintains itself, suggesting a sort of dual system. A
newcomer explained that residents clean up after themselves, and when
they feel like doing some extra picking up, they do. An old-time
resident who was more involved in decision-making explained there was a
garbage committee, answerable to the "Common Meeting," responsible for
the bottom-line of keeping Christiania clean, though clearly voluntary
assistance and cleanliness by all the residents was the first line of
defense.

#### Economy

Christiania does not have private property. Filmmaker Richard Jackman
explains, "Even if you build your own house or renovate an apartment,
you cannot sell it when you move out, and the local area meeting decides
who will move into a vacant home."[^18]

Industries and work performed in Christiania include:

- Blacksmiths
- Metalworkers (who specialize in making eco-friendly ovens and
  "<a   href="Bicycle.md" class="wikilink" title="bikes">"bikes</a>)
- Jewelers
- Potters
- Candle makers
- Shoemakers
- Restaurants and cafés
- A cabinetry workshop
- A bicycle workshop
- A kindergarten
- A clinic
- A health food shop
- A book shop
- An anarchist space
- A concert venue
- Various artisan crafts

Most businesses are
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
title="worker-owned cooperatives">"worker-owned cooperatives</a>. All of
these industries are
"<a   href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management.md" class="wikilink"
title="self-managed">"self-managed</a>, and pay a tax/rent to the
community which is then used for community projects and to pay for
utilities.[^19][^20]

For many years, Christiania was famous for its open cannabis trade on
Pusher Street (also known as "Green Light District" by the Christianian
council). While cannabis trade remains illegal in Denmark, authorities
were for many years reluctant to forcibly stop it in Christiania. The
open drug market faced increasing opposition from residents,
particularly after violent incidents, leading to multiple attempts by
the community to shut it down. When local residents removed the Pusher
Street stalls in 2016, cannabis sales dropped by about 75%. Residents
have consistently emphasized that drug dealers do not adhere to the laws
and values of the free city, and that money earned from drug sales
finances gangs rather than Christiania itself.

#### Environmental Protection

Despite receiving over one million visitors a year, Christiania has
managed to keep the streets, buildings, restaurants, public toilets, and
public showers all very clean, with much of the neighbourhood covered in
trees and kept automobile-free. Residents have been taking out their own
trash for over thirty years.[^21]

Residents have built dozens of the houses now standing in Christiania
using innovative eco-designs. The houses use solar and wind power, and
composting and reed beds to filter waste. A method of filtering sewage
through reed beds means water coming out of Christiania is as clean as
that coming out from the rest of Copenhagen's treatment plants. These
innovations helped the commune be shortlisted for a pan-Scandinavian
award for ecological living.[^22]

The community features many idiosyncratic constructions exemplifying
modern "architecture without architects", including glass houses and
creative reuse of the historic military buildings.

#### Culture

The residents of Christiania are called *Christianit*, or
*Christianshavner* and *Amagerkaner* because Christiania is located on
the island of Amager.[^23]

Christiania has developed a distinct cultural identity over its decades
of existence. The community is known for its colorful murals,
alternative lifestyle, and creative expression. Small children run free,
their parents relaxed as long as they stay within sight, and dogs run
free as well.[^24] Historic military buildings have been repurposed and
renamed with creative names like *Aircondition*, *Autogena*,
*Fakirskolen* ('the Fakir School') and *Kosmiske Blomst* ('Cosmic
Flower').

The community has been recognized for its cultural contributions, with
Christiania's own development plan awarded the Initiative Award of the
Society for the Beautification of Copenhagen in November 2006.[^25]

#### Crime and Safety

Christiania functions as a largely police-free zone. Although soft drugs
are common, the community has made repeated efforts to ban hard
drugs.[^26]

Early in Christiania's history, a section decided to allow police in.
They found the police continually ignoring hard drug users while
arresting soft drug users, so they expelled the police. The community
has since handled internal security issues through collective
decision-making and direct action. In 1979, residents organized a "Junk
Blockade" against hard drugs.

Murals and signs around Christiania make the community's opposition to
heroin and hard drugs clear, reflecting the community's ongoing struggle
to maintain its values.

### Negatives

#### Drug-related violence

While Christiania was founded on anarchist principles of self-governance
and community autonomy, the presence of an illegal drug market has
brought significant challenges. The community has faced recurring
violence related to cannabis sales, including shootings, grenade
attacks, and conflicts between criminal gangs seeking control of the
drug trade.

The drug trade has been controlled by outside cartels rather than by the
community itself, undermining Christiania's autonomy and bringing
violence that conflicts with the community's values. Multiple violent
incidents have occurred:

- 1984: A motorcycle gang attempted to sell hard drugs but was expelled
  by residents
- 2005: A gang shooting killed one man and injured three others
- 2009: A hand grenade attack at Cafe Nemoland left one person with
  severe facial injuries
- 2016: A shooting of two police officers and a civilian
- 2023: A shooting that killed one person and injured four others

These incidents have repeatedly forced the community to confront the
contradiction between their anarchist values and the presence of violent
criminal enterprises. Residents have made multiple attempts to address
this issue, including the 1979 "Junk Blockade" against hard drugs, the
2016 removal of Pusher Street stalls, and the 2023 vote to close Pusher
Street entirely with government assistance.
