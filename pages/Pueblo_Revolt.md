In 1680, the Pueblo peoples of what is now the southwestern "United
States" succeeded in kicking Spanish colonizers out of their "New
Mexico" territories for some twelve years. The uprising included an
alliance of Pueblo peoples--including the
<a href="Hopi" class="wikilink" title="Hopi">Hopi</a> and
<a href="Zuni" class="wikilink" title="Zuni">Zuni</a>--assisted by
<a href="Diné" class="wikilink" title="Diné">Diné</a>, Apache, Ute, and
African rebels. The historian Colin Calloway calls it "one of the most
effective Indian resistance movements in American history."[^1]

The Tewa Pueblo medicine man Popé had spent five years building
alliances across the Pueblo towns that had never before united in
warfare. By 1680, his vision of a pan-Pueblo confederation materialized,
as Indians blamed devastating drought and disease on the brutal Spanish
colonizers' ban on indigenous religious rituals. The alliance united
some seventeen thousand Pubelos who resided in over twenty-four towns
and spoke at least six languages.[^2]

William Loren Katz notes that African maroons joined the revolt: "As
Spanish conquistadores penetrated the southwest, enslaved Africans among
them escaped whenever they could. The Navaho, Apache, Ute, and the
western Pueblo— which included Hopi and Zuni Nations—welcomed those who
deserted the conquerors, and found Africans had much to offer."[^3]
Domingo Naranjo, described as "very tall, black with very large, yellow
eyes," became one of Popé's officers.[^4]

Divided by six languages, the Pueblo rebels organized a relatively
decentralized resistance, coordinated by messengers running from town to
town with strings of knots representing the number of days until the
revolt.[^5]

The decentralized rebellion took spiritual leadership from the
Po-he-yemu ("one who scatters mist"), meaning the sky. According to
Kevin Tucker, "The Spanish were well aware that a revolt was being
planned, but could get no information other than the leader being
Po-he-yemu, whom was believed to be on the other side of the mountains
where captured and interrogated Pueblos would point. The entire time
they were looking for an actual being when ironically their unknown
ring-leader was the sky.[^6]

The rebels knew that the Spanish depended on supplies coming from wagons
fording the Rio Grande, and that the river was impossible for wagons to
ford during a flood. So, Pueblos paid attention as the rains came, and
they realized that supply shipments would be delayed until late August.
They decided to strike the Spanish on 10 August, as the Spanish were
running low on supplies and the new shipment was.[^7]

Pueblo militants captured Santa Fe and cut off settlers' water supply.
After nine days, the Spanish retreated southward, “\[b\]ewildered by the
scale and success of the uprising.”[^8] The Pueblos had kicked the
Spanish out of New Mexico. It was a victory born of confederation.

When Popé took power, however, he established a centralized government
over the formerly autonomous Pueblo towns. The historian Robert
Silverberg calls this centralization “the most alien concept \[the
Spanish\] had brought”.[^9] As the Pueblo governor, Popé moved into the
Spanish governor's former palace. He enslaved Pueblos who had refused to
join his rebellion and who disobeyed him. Popé banned Christian rituals
with a fervor rivalling the Spaniards' persecution of indigenous
rituals. As drought and disease persisted, the Pueblo population quickly
grew disenchanted with the new regime. “To some it seemed that things
had been under the Spaniards,” Silverberg writes.[^10]

One of those dissatisfied Pueblos, named Juan, confessed to Spanish
priests in 1681. Juan complained that Popé banned Christianity, and he
said that many Pueblos felt the Spanish “must come and gain the kingdom”
of New Mexico.[^11]

When the Spanish finally did reconquer the territory in 1692, they
encountered little resistance. By centralizing political power, Popé
destroyed the fragile alliance he had helped establish among the
Pueblos.
