From 1605 to 1694 in Brazil, Palmares was a federation of between 10,000
and 30,000 people, mostly runaway African slaves. Other residents
included Indigenous, Jewish and Muslim people. As a "quasi-state,"
"Palmares possessed a complex social structure, replicating, in many
instances, African political systems."[^1]

In <a href="Anarchism_in_Latin_America" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchism in Latin America">Anarchism in Latin America</a>,
Cappelletti calls Palmares "a community that in some sense was socialist
and self-managed."

The Portuguese and Dutch colonizers "made no less than eighteen attempts
to destroy it."[^2] Palmares was eventually captured and destroyed by
the Portuguese.
