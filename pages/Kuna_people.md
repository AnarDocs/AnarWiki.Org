The Kuna people of Central America have an egalitarian matriarchal
society that practices consensus-based decision making. About 60,000 of
the Kuna live in Panama's archipelago called Kuna Yuna (formerly Sans
Blas).

Though the Kuna has often been described as "matriarchal," this does not
indicate that women are dominant over others. In fact, there is gender
complementarity, with women having the upper hand at the local level,
men having the upper-hand at the regional level, and transgender
individuals being welcomed and respected.

# Culture

The Kuna are matrilineal and matrilocal.[^1] The *Irish Times* reports,
"And what does being a Kuna woman in a matriarchal society feel like?
'It's a good life,' says one young woman, bashfully."[^2]

The culture's most important ritual is the girl's initiation into
womanhood, known as the *Diwe Inna*.[^3] There is also an important
festival when a girl menstruates for the first time. There are no
comparable rituals for boys, and even weddings are a much more simple
affair.[^4]

In this matriarchal culture, the women dress much more elaborately than
men do. Heide Goettner-Abendroth explains:

> Before Christian mission schools were built in their territories, men
> used to wear nothing but a gold- en penis-holder and feathers; today
> they wear inexpensive western clothing. The women, on the other hand,
> are well dressed. They used to wear only a cloth wrap- around skirt,
> but were adorned from head to hips with their own creative and
> elaborate body painting in a great variety of fantastic forms. They
> also wore the family gold on their bodies as heavy, round plates in
> their ears and around their necks, sup- plemented by golden
> breastplates and nose rings. Although missionaries insisted that Kuna
> women cover themselves, they stayed true to traditional styles: as
> talent- ed painters, they transferred body painting designs to
> post-contact cotton blouses, and later began to practice their art in
> the form of needlework. This needlework, which adorns their blouses,
> or 'molas,' still expresses the fantastic forms that portray the
> entirety of their mythical cosmology—including modern images derived
> from American television commercials.

## Third Gender

There is a third gender called *Omeggid* referring to those who are
assigned male at birth and then adopt mainly feminine traits. The
Omeggid often choose traditionally feminine professions such as weaving
molas.[^5]

# Decisions

Women are more powerful at the local level, and men are more powerful at
the regional level. Anthropologist Diego Madi Dias summarizes, "while
women make all the domestic decisions, they are rarely politicians or
chiefs."[^6]

At the local level:

> "Women are the boss," says Jose Davies, a Kuna museum archivist. "My
> wife makes all the decisions. If I say to her, tomorrow I'm going
> fishing, she could say to me, no, we need bananas, go to the mainland
> and bring back bananas. So I go to the mainland and bring back
> bananas."[^7]

At the regional level, men make decisions at public assemblies. Kuna
chiefs, who are usually men, serve as facilitators and can be
immediately recalled by their communities. They maintain their role only
if they have popular consent. Each village's assembly meets two to three
times a week. Delegates and chiefs gather for a regional assembly a few
times a year.[^8]

# Economy

Women control the land and own what's grown on it. Men do the farming
and hand the harvest over to the matriarch so that the women can
distribute it fairly.[^9]

# Environment

In Kuna religion, "everything has a soul: rocks, water, wind, plants,
animals and people all possess souls."[^10] The Kuna have struggled
actively against ecologically destructive projects such as the
Pan-American Highway.[^11]

Kuna Yuna's islands are at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels
due to global warming.[^12]
