## History

### Origins

The **Catholic Worker Movement** is a collection of autonomous
communities founded by
"<a   href="Dorothy_Day.md" class="wikilink" title="Dorothy Day">Dorothy
Day</a> and
"<a   href="Peter_Maurin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Maurin">Peter
Maurin</a> in the United States in 1933. Its aim is to "live in
accordance with the justice and charity of
"<a   href="Jesus_Christ.md" class="wikilink" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus
Christ</a>".[^1] The movement began as a response to the Great
Depression, initially starting with the *Catholic Worker* newspaper
created by Dorothy Day to advance Catholic social teaching and maintain
a neutral, "<a   href="Christian_pacifism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian pacifist">Christian pacifist</a> position in the
war-torn 1930s.

Day attempted to put her words from the *Catholic Worker* into action
through ""<a   href="house_of_hospitality.md" class="wikilink"
title="houses of hospitality">houses of hospitality</a>" and then
through a series of farms for people to live together on communes. The
idea of "<a   href="voluntary_poverty.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary poverty">voluntary poverty</a> was advocated for those
who volunteered to work at the houses of hospitality. Many people would
come to the Catholic Workers for assistance, then becoming Workers
themselves.

The *Catholic Worker* newspaper spread the idea to other cities in the
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a>, as well as to
"<a   href="Canada.md" class="wikilink" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the
"<a   href="United_Kingdom.md" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">United
Kingdom</a>, through the reports printed by those who had experienced
working in the houses of hospitality. More than 30 independent but
affiliated communities had been founded by 1941. Between 1965 and 1980
an additional 76 communities were founded.

### Current Status

As of 2022, there were 159 Catholic Worker communities in the United
States and 28 in other countries including Australia, Canada, Dominican
Republic, Kenya, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, South
Korea, Sweden, the Netherlands, Uganda and the United Kingdom.[^2] The
movement claims over 240 local Catholic Worker communities providing
social services worldwide.

## Organisation

The Catholic Worker is a network of communes whose members "live a
simple lifestyle in community, serve the poor, and resist war and social
injustice." Each house has a different mission, going about the work of
"<a   href="social_justice.md" class="wikilink" title="social justice">social
justice</a> in its own way, suited to its local region. Day appointed
the directors of each of the houses, each of which operated autonomously
and came to vary in size and character.

Catholic Worker houses are not official organs of the Catholic Church,
and their activities, inspired by Day's example, may be more or less
overtly religious in tone and inspiration depending on the particular
institution. Initially, these houses of hospitality had little
organization and no requirements for membership. As time passed some
basic rules and policies were established.

One of the movement's guiding principles is hospitality towards those on
the margin of society, based on the principles of
"<a   href="communitarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="communitarianism">communitarianism</a> and
"<a   href="personalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="personalism">personalism</a>. According to co-founder Peter
Maurin, the beliefs of the Catholic Worker include:

- Gentle "<a   href="personalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="personalism">personalism</a> of traditional Catholicism
- Personal obligation of looking after the needs of our brother
- Daily practice of the

  title="Houses of hospitality">Houses of hospitality</a> for the

- Establishment of Farming Communes where each one "<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need.md"
  class="wikilink"
  title="works according to his ability and receives according to his need">works
  according to his ability and receives according to his need</a>
- Creating a

  title="new society within the shell of the old">new society within the

Advocating nonviolence and voluntary poverty inspired by Jesus and the
"<a   href="Early_Christians.md" class="wikilink"
title="Early Christians">Early Christians</a>, the Catholic Worker's
vision emphasizes individuality, decentralization and sustainability:

**Personalism** - A philosophy which regards the freedom and dignity of
each person as the basis, focus and goal of all metaphysics and morals.
In following such wisdom, we move away from a self-centered
individualism toward the good of the other. This is to be done by taking
personal responsibility for changing conditions, rather than looking to
the state or other institutions to provide impersonal "charity."

**A decentralized society** - In contrast to the present bigness of
government, industry, education, health care and agriculture. We
encourage efforts such as family farms, rural and urban land trusts,
worker ownership and management of small factories, homesteading
projects, food, housing and other cooperatives--any effort in which
money can once more become merely a medium of exchange, and human beings
are no longer commodities.

**A "green revolution"** - So that it is possible to rediscover the
proper meaning of our labor and our true bonds with the land; a
distributist communitarianism, self-sufficient through farming, crafting
and appropriate technology; a radically new society where people will
rely on the fruits of their own toil and labor; associations of
mutuality, and a sense of fairness to resolve conflicts.

The movement campaigns for "<a   href="nonviolence.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolence">nonviolence</a> and is active in opposing both
"<a   href="anti-war.md" class="wikilink" title="war">war</a> and the unequal
global "<a   href="distribution_of_wealth.md" class="wikilink"
title="distribution of wealth">distribution of wealth</a>. Day also
founded the *"<a   href="Catholic_Worker_(newspaper).md" class="wikilink"
title="Catholic Worker">Catholic Worker</a>* newspaper, still published
by the two Catholic Worker houses in
"<a   href="New_York_City.md" class="wikilink" title="New York City">New York
City</a>, and sold for one cent a copy.

## Criticism

The radical philosophy of the group can be described as
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">Christian anarchism</a>. Co-founder Dorothy
Day identified as an Anarchist. Anne Klejment, a history lecturer at the
"<a   href="University_of_St._Thomas_(Minnesota).md" class="wikilink"
title="University of St. Thomas">University of St. Thomas</a>, wrote of
the movement:

"The Catholic Worker considered itself a Christian anarchist movement.
All authority came from God; and the state, having by choice distanced
itself from "<a   href="Christian_perfectionism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian perfectionism">Christian perfectionism</a>, forfeited
its ultimate authority over the citizen… Catholic Worker anarchism
followed Christ as a model of
"<a   href="nonviolent_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="nonviolent revolution">nonviolent revolutionary</a> behavior… He
respected individual conscience. But he also preached a prophetic
message, difficult for many of his contemporaries to embrace."

Although Christian, the Catholic Workers generally criticize church
hierarchy and promote tolerance of other religions. They are also
anti-capitalist, preaching voluntary poverty and "distributist
communitarianism; self-sufficien\[cy\] through farming, crafting, and
appropriate technology; a radically new society where people will rely
on the fruits of their own toil and labor; associations of mutuality,
and a sense of fairness to resolve conflicts."

## Anarchy Works Summary

From Peter Gelderloos, Anarchy Works:[^3]

The Catholic Worker movement began in the United States in 1933 as a
response to the Great Depression, but today many of the 185 Catholic
Worker communities throughout North America and Europe focus on opposing
the militarism of the government and creating the foundations of a
peaceful society. Inseparable from their opposition to war is their
commitment to social justice, which manifests in the soup kitchens,
shelters, and other service projects to help the poor that form a part
of every Catholic Worker house. Some Catholic Workers even call
themselves Christian Anarchists.

Catholic Worker communities, which function as communes or aid centers
for the poor, often provide a base for protests and direct actions
against the military. Catholic Workers have entered military bases to
sabotage weaponry, though they waited for the police afterwards,
intentionally going to jail as a further act of protest. Some of their
communities also shelter victims of war, such as torture survivors
fleeing the results of US imperialism in other countries.
