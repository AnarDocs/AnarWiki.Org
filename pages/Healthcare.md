# Healthcare Under Anarchism

Anarchist thought offers a profound critique of existing healthcare
systems and proposes alternative models based on principles of direct
action, mutual aid, and self-governance. This approach fundamentally
seeks to transform healthcare by dismantling existing hierarchies and
replacing them with systems based on community control, worker
self-management, and care as a common good rather than commodity.

## Origins

### Historical Foundations

Anarchist involvement in healthcare has deep historical roots, often
manifesting through grassroots efforts and direct challenges to
oppressive structures:

**Early Activism and Midwifery:**
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, a prominent anarchist, worked as a nurse and midwife in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, advocating for women's reproductive
freedom and birth control amidst high maternal mortality rates among the
working class.[^1] Goldman valued nursing for the sense of community and
connectivity she believed it encouraged, for helping her understand real
world problems, and as a vehicle to translate political philosophy into
meaningful, practical activism.

**Friendly Societies (UK, 1600s-1900s):** These were mutual aid and
insurance associations, often workplace or community-based, that
provided medical insurance. They resisted government regulation and
faced opposition from the medical establishment, such as the British
Medical Association, who viewed them as "appalling" examples of doctors
being dictated to by their "social inferiors".

**The Peckham Health Centre (London, 1926-1950):** This pioneering
experiment focused on **promoting health and well-being rather than
treating disease**. It operated on principles of family-centred
membership, a small weekly subscription, and autonomous administration,
with "no guiding planners, no cliques, no closed doors, no hierarchies".
Despite its success in fostering community ownership and improving
health, it was rejected by the newly formed National Health Service
(NHS) for not conforming to centralised, free, and illness-focused state
models. Although the founder rejected the label of 'anarchist', others
have pointed out that the centre worked along several anarchist
principles, including contribution and autonomy where doctors did not
direct but instead supported people to make informed choices about their
own health.

**Spanish Revolution (1936):** During this period, the CNT Federation of
Health Workers, comprising 40,000 members, established a comprehensive
health service in Catalonia, providing universal healthcare, treating
civil war victims, and implementing preventative medicine programs based
on local community health centres. Hospitals and health centres were
socialised and linked in federations, operating on libertarian
principles. This demonstrated how medical care could be organised
without state control or private profit through worker collectives.

**Welsh Miners' Medical Aid Societies:** The Welsh miners developed
comprehensive mutual aid healthcare systems that directly influenced the
formation of Britain's National Health Service. These community-created
healthcare systems operated through collective contributions and
democratic control, with miners pooling resources to employ doctors and
establish medical facilities for their communities. The societies
demonstrated how working-class communities could organise effective
healthcare provision independent of both state control and private
profit. [^2] The miners' model showed that healthcare could be both
universal and community-controlled, providing a template for socialised
medicine that predated and helped shape national healthcare systems.
However, when these principles were incorporated into the NHS, the
horizontal, community-based decision-making structures were replaced
with centralised state bureaucracy, illustrating how anarchist
healthcare innovations can be co-opted and hierarchicalised by state
institutions.

### Theoretical Development

The theoretical foundations of anarchist healthcare draw from
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>'s concept of **mutual aid**, which challenged social
Darwinism's emphasis on competition. Kropotkin observed that cooperation
and mutual support were more important factors for survival and
flourishing than competition, both in animal societies and human
communities. This principle became central to anarchist approaches to
healthcare organisation.

Contemporary anarchist theory has expanded these ideas to encompass
**posthuman** perspectives, recognising healthcare as part of
interconnected relationships between humans, non-human beings, and
environments. This approach rejects the anthropocentrism of earlier
anarchist thought while maintaining core principles of anti-hierarchy
and mutual aid.

## Tendencies

### Community-Based Mutual Aid

Modern examples of anarchist healthcare principles include:

**Community Survival Networks:** Recent crises, like the COVID-19
pandemic, have highlighted failures of centralised authorities and led
to surges in community-led mutual aid efforts globally, from
distributing food and masks in Brazil to forming community networks in
South Africa. See <a href="Vaccination" class="wikilink"
title="Vaccination">Vaccination</a> for further information.

**Free Clinics and Direct Action:** Examples include free clinics in
Greece due to austerity, the development of DIY pharmaceuticals,
pro-bono care for refugees, and community clinics like Common Ground
Health Clinic in the US and the Self-Organized Health Structure of
Exarchia (ADYE) in Greece. The Young Lords (US, 1960s-1970s) made health
and healthcare central to their work, employing confrontational and
educational strategies including occupying hospitals and health
department offices.

**Professional Resistance:** Healthcare workers increasingly engage in
direct action by refusing to cooperate with harmful policies, providing
supplies to uninsured patients, refusing to share information with
immigration authorities, and organising strikes for better working
conditions. As anarchist nursing scholars note, this involves ending
"cop shit" - pedagogical and professional techniques that presume
adversarial relationships between healthcare workers and patients.

### How Anarchism Addresses These Problems

An anarchist approach fundamentally seeks to transform healthcare by
dismantling existing hierarchies and replacing them with systems based
on mutual aid, direct democracy, and community control:

**Universal, Free Healthcare:** An anarchist system would be **universal
and free at the point of access**, eliminating financial barriers to
care and encouraging preventative medicine.

**Decentralised and Community-Led:** Healthcare services would be
**organised from the bottom-up, owned, run by, and accountable to local
communities or communes**. This approach champions grassroots
initiatives and mutual aid networks.

**Worker and User Self-Management:** Healthcare workers, patients, and
community members would directly control services, with minimal or no
hierarchy. Doctors would be employed by the commune, focused on patient
needs rather than profit. Decisions would be made by those doing the
work, with feedback from patients and students.

**Emphasis on Preventative Medicine and Health Education:** There would
be a massive investment in public healthcare, primary care, and
community care, with a strong emphasis on health education and
preventative medicine.

**Elimination of the Profit Motive:** Healthcare would be free of profit
motives, challenging pharmaceutical companies' exorbitant prices by
eliminating intellectual property laws and encouraging open-access
production of medications.

**Challenging All Hierarchies and Domination:** Anarchism provides a
framework to continually question and dismantle all forms of hierarchy
and oppression within healthcare, including those related to gender,
race, and economic status.

**Direct Action and Popular Campaigns:** Reforms would be fought for
through direct action and popular campaigns in communities and
workplaces, building "dual power" structures where communities serve and
are responsible to themselves, independent of the state.

### Transition Methods

Transitioning to an anarchist healthcare system involves a multi-faceted
approach, focusing on building new structures while simultaneously
challenging existing ones:

**Small Steps and Demonstrating Success:** Implementation requires
"small steps" and concrete evidence of success to overcome public
reliance on the current system.

**Direct Action and Dual Power:** This means actively building
alternative, self-organised structures that provide healthcare services
(dual power) while simultaneously engaging in direct action and
grassroots agitation to demand change and expose the failings of the
state and capitalist system.

**Workplace Organising:** Healthcare workers are encouraged to organise
within their workplaces, employing tools like workplace mapping and
one-on-ones, to build power and challenge existing conditions. This is
seen as a crucial step towards systemic change and social revolution.

**Cultivating Radical Professionals:** There's a need to increase the
number of trained and licensed leftist healthcare professionals
(physicians, nurses, paramedics, etc.) who can influence institutional
policies, organise workers, and staff new mutual aid programs. Mentoring
students and providing free training (e.g., street medic classes) are
key methods.

**Forming New, Non-Hierarchical Unions:** Advocating for revolutionary
factions within existing unions and establishing new patient and worker
unions that are non-hierarchical.

**Building Anarchist Networks:** Creating interconnected networks of
anarchist health initiatives, allowing for the sharing of ideas and
strategies, which can inspire widespread revolutionary change.

**Prefigurative Politics:** Actions taken today aim to "model the
organization, and relationships that could form in the future,"
effectively "building a new world in the shell of the old".

**"Seize the Hospitals":** This slogan represents the ultimate goal of
physically taking control of healthcare institutions from capitalist and
state control, a vision attainable through sufficient organisation and
power.

### Organisational Models

**Self-Management and Autonomy:** Healthcare facilities would be
autonomous units, run by general assemblies of all workers (medical,
administrative, maintenance) who would elect and mandate administrative
staff and decide policy. This includes functional self-management where
different professional groups manage their own work while coordinating
horizontally.

**Community and Patient Control:** Patients and community members would
have a significant say in the running of the system, providing essential
feedback to ensure quality and responsiveness to local needs. Patients
would be treated as experts on their own bodies, fostering dialogue and
dismantling unhelpful hierarchies between patients and practitioners.

**Decentralised Provision and Primary Care Focus:** A modern primary
care system would be established, with GPs, nurses, physiotherapists,
social workers, and other health workers operating in teams from
well-equipped, community-based primary care centres. This would involve
a much higher ratio of doctors to population, ensuring closer
doctor/patient relationships and promoting preventative check-ups.

**Federated Systems:** Autonomous hospitals and health centres would be
linked in federations, allowing for sharing of resources and information
while enabling quick adjustment to local requirements. The Spanish
Revolution provided examples of federated health services divided into
zones, with central committees coordinating autonomous departments.

**Funding through Socialised Means:** Resources would be provided by
communes, syndicates, and their federations, free from profit motives.
While traditional state taxation and private insurance are rejected,
careful design of a universal health insurance system (compulsory,
publicly funded, and free from private insurers) could ensure equity and
a dependable flow of funds. Other models include community
contributions, donations, bartering (like the Ithaca Health System), or
collectivist approaches seen in groups like the Amish, where communities
pool resources to cover medical bills.

**Reclaiming Health as a Common Good:** Anarchism fundamentally seeks to
reclaim health as an **irreducible social and common good**, accessible
to all and not subject to instrumentalisation or compromise.

**Emphasis on Expertise and Accessibility:** While challenging
hierarchies, an anarchist system would acknowledge the need for experts
and specialists, aiming to decentralise medical knowledge and ensure it
is accessible, rather than confined to a "small group of professional,
highly-educated elites".

## Criticism

### Challenges for Implementation

### Special Challenges

**Transition and Public Acceptance:** Overcoming the public's ingrained
reliance on existing systems and the deeply embedded "abstract slogans"
of revolution to make practical progress. Anarchism is often
misunderstood and associated with violence, which could hinder
widespread public acceptance.

**Sustaining Funding and Resources:** Securing consistent and adequate
funding for a truly universal, free system without traditional state
taxation or private insurance models is a continuous challenge. While
community contributions and alternative funding mechanisms exist,
acquiring regulated items like medications and needles outside
traditional systems remains difficult.

**Scaling and Coordination:** While local, autonomous initiatives are
central, scaling these to provide comprehensive, specialised care for a
larger population across diverse geographical areas without a
centralised authority presents complex coordination challenges. Ensuring
consistency and quality across self-managed units could be difficult.

**Balancing Professional Expertise and Community Autonomy:** The need to
dismantle "unhelpful hierarchies of knowledge" between patients and
practitioners while still ensuring the necessary advanced medical
knowledge and expertise is available and utilised effectively.
Historical opposition from the medical establishment to community-led
initiatives highlights this tension.

**Quality Control and Safety of "DIY" Approaches:** While DIY
pharmacology is proposed as a response to inaccessible medication,
sources acknowledge serious practical problems, safety concerns, risks
of contamination, and the need for trained and licensed professionals to
ensure safe and effective care. Misinformation, as seen during the
COVID-19 pandemic, could also pose a significant challenge to public
health initiatives.

**Combating Public Apathy and Sustaining Engagement:** Despite
widespread dissatisfaction with current healthcare systems, popular
campaigns often struggle to broaden their scope beyond local issues or
maintain long-term momentum. Inspiring and sustaining mass collective
action and self-organisation remains a continuous challenge for an
anarchist approach.

**Preventing New Forms of Hierarchy and Domination:** A core tenet of
anarchism is the opposition to all forms of hierarchy. The ongoing
challenge within any self-organised system is to perpetually question
power relations and prevent the emergence of new elites or coercive
structures, ensuring "a condition of permanent revolution, a continuing
rebellion against our own tendencies toward entrenchment and
domination".

**Historical Baggage:** Early anarchist figures were sometimes
associated with eugenic ideas, though this was actively challenged by
other anarchists like Kropotkin, which is a historical issue that might
need addressing in public discourse.

### Problems with Existing Systems

Anarchist critique identifies fundamental problems with current
healthcare systems:

**Cost and Access Barriers:** Systems are often described as an
"apartheid system" where access to care is determined by ability to pay,
leading to unequal treatment. High costs for GP visits, private health
insurance, and prescription drugs act as significant disincentives for
seeking timely care and preventative measures.

**Systemic Inequality and Two-Tier Care:** Access to public hospital
beds can involve years-long waits for public patients, while private
patients receive treatment within weeks in the same publicly funded
institutions, reflecting a rationing system based on wealth.

**Underinvestment and Lack of Preventative Focus:** Historical
underfunding leads to insufficient capacity, equipment, and staffing.
There is a chronic lack of emphasis on primary care and preventative
medicine, with disproportionate amounts of care taking place in
hospitals.

**Hierarchical Structures and Lack of Accountability:** Power
imbalances, such as the Department of Finance controlling health
spending, and contracts giving undue power to medical professionals (GPs
and consultants), are prevalent. GPs, often self-employed, prioritise
private patients due to financial incentives, and consultants often
delegate care without accountability. Rigid hospital hierarchies impede
patient safety. Employment caps lead to a reliance on temporary agency
workers, hindering future planning.

**Profit Motive and Marketisation:** Healthcare is increasingly run as a
business, benefiting corporations (e.g., drug companies, private
insurers) and the wealthy. Policies like "payment by results" and
Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) introduce market dynamics.
Pharmaceutical companies "rip off" public health services with
artificially inflated drug prices, driven by corporate-state schemes and
stringent intellectual property laws, making essential medications
unaffordable. CEO salaries in health insurance can reach millions.

**Centralised State Control and Ineffectiveness:** Governments are seen
as unwilling to implement genuine reform or challenge vested interests,
often prioritising their own benefactors over constituents. Traditional
methods of advocacy like trade union action or electing politicians are
deemed ineffective. The creation of welfare states, like the NHS, led to
a "loss of local self-organisation and mutual aid initiatives,"
fostering dependency. Criticisms extend to "Medicare for All" proposals,
which are seen as vague, failing to address drug costs or lobbying,
dictating care through reimbursement reductions, and ultimately
remaining a temporary solution within capitalism. The state is often
critiqued for failing to act in public best interests, as seen in the
COVID-19 pandemic response and persistent underfunding.

## Contemporary Applications

### Direct Action in Healthcare

Healthcare workers can engage in numerous forms of direct action:
refusing to discharge patients without shelter to unsafe conditions,
speaking to media about working conditions, whistleblowing on unsafe
practices, ensuring uninsured patients receive adequate supplies,
refusing cooperation with immigration enforcement, and striking for
better conditions.

**Cutting "Cop Shit":** This involves ending adversarial relationships
between healthcare workers and patients, rejecting "compliance" language
that treats patients as subordinates, and questioning mandated reporting
requirements that often harm marginalised communities, particularly
Black and brown families.

### Mutual Aid Networks

Contemporary mutual aid in healthcare involves establishing systems of
care, solidarity, and generosity outside existing state and
institutional structures. This includes:

**Participatory Problem-Solving:** Those on the frontlines of crises are
best positioned to improve outcomes through direct action that is
spontaneous, doesn't rely on regulatory actors, and allows autonomous
decision-making.

**Building Parallel Institutions:** Creating alternative healthcare
systems that meet survival needs while building shared understanding
about why people lack access to care, mobilising people to expand
solidarity, and solving problems through collective action rather than
waiting for external solutions.

### Nursing and Anarchist Practice

**Buurtzorg Model:** The Dutch home-care organization Buurtzorg
Nederland demonstrates many anarchist principles in practice, though not
explicitly anarchist in ideology. Founded in 2006 by nurses dissatisfied
with traditional hierarchical healthcare delivery, Buurtzorg operates
through self-governing teams of 10-12 highly trained nurses who take
complete responsibility for 50-60 patients in their neighborhood. These
autonomous teams make their own decisions about patient care, work
arrangements, and resource allocation without traditional management
oversight. The model eliminates the artificial division of labor that
separates medical care from support services, with nurses providing
holistic care rather than being constrained by bureaucratic role
definitions. Buurtzorg's flat organizational structure, emphasis on
nurse autonomy, and integration of medical and social care reflects
anarchist principles of worker self-management and rejection of
unnecessary hierarchy. The organization has achieved both high worker
satisfaction (the highest of any Dutch company) and cost-effectiveness,
demonstrating that non-hierarchical organization can be both more humane
and more efficient than traditional capitalist healthcare models.
However, the model still operates within the broader capitalist
healthcare system and relies on state funding, illustrating both the
possibilities and limitations of implementing anarchist principles
within existing institutional frameworks.

Nursing offers particular opportunities for anarchist practice due to
nurses' proximity to human struggle and comfort with complex human
interactions. Anarchist nursing involves:

**Horizontal Organisation:** Rejecting historical hierarchical
structures by referring to physicians as colleagues rather than
authorities, occupying physical space equally in meetings, and
supporting solidarity between different nursing groups.

**Community Engagement:** Moving beyond hospital walls to provide mobile
healthcare, participating in protests and community organising, and
establishing clinics for vulnerable populations who fear stigmatisation
in traditional medical settings.

**Militant Joy:** Building communities of resistance where healthcare
workers can celebrate, support each other, and maintain hope for radical
transformation. This counters the alienation and despair common in
current healthcare systems.
