# Are Rulers Inevitable?

## Isn't hierarchy necessary for society to function?

Far from being necessary, hierarchy actively inhibits society's healthy
functioning. When we speak of hierarchy, we refer specifically to
institutionalised authority—systems where some individuals are granted
power over others based on position rather than competence. As Bakunin
noted, we must distinguish between "rational authority" based on
competence, which helps others grow, and "irrational authority" based on
power, which exploits those subjected to it. Anarchists don't oppose all
forms of influence but rather the artificial, privileged, and official
forms that lead to oppression and exploitation.

Hierarchy not only fails to make society function better—it actively
damages it. The Miners' Next Step captured this when noting that
leadership "implies power held by the leader" and that the "sum of
initiative, responsibility, and self-respect" of the workers "becomes
his." This concentration of power stifles creativity, critical thinking,
and problem-solving capabilities in the vast majority of people. As
Colin Ward observed, people "do go from womb to tomb without realising
their human potential, precisely because the power to initiate, to
participate in innovating, choosing, judging, and deciding is reserved
for the top men." The result is a tragic waste of human potential and
the creation of serious social inequality.

Contrary to claims that hierarchy provides necessary coordination,
anarchist alternatives based on free association, horizontal
decision-making, and mutual aid allow for more effective cooperation.
When people participate as equals, they develop greater capacity for
self-management and mutual respect. As noted in the texts, even complex
undertakings require coordination, but this can be achieved without
hierarchical authority. Proudhon differentiates between workplaces where
employees are "subordinated, exploited" versus those where workers
"participate" and "have a voice in the council." In the latter case,
power is "diffused to the collectivity and becomes the true expression
of the liberty of everyone."

The supposed efficiency of hierarchy is another myth. Malatesta pointed
out that rulers "can only make use of the forces that exist in society"
while hierarchy itself "greatly reduces" society's "productive,
organising and protective forces." Hierarchical structures restrict
information flow, stifle innovation, and create needless bureaucracy.
They generate resistance and conflict rather than harmony. As the text
notes, "the fantastic inefficiency of any hierarchical organisation—any
factory, office, university, warehouse or hospital—is the outcome of"
knowledge and wisdom not being distributed according to rank, and people
being present through economic necessity rather than identification with
common goals. In contrast, anarchist organisation allows the free
development of individuals' capabilities in cooperation with others,
creating a society that functions to meet human needs rather than to
maintain systems of control.

## Isn't hierarchy inevitable whenever you have a group of people of a certain size and above?

The claim that hierarchy is inevitable in large groups demonstrates a
profound lack of historical understanding. Anthropological evidence
reveals countless examples of large-scale, non-hierarchical societies
throughout human history. As the text explains, Christopher Boehm's
study surveying dozens of egalitarian societies across continents found
that the common factor was "a moralistic determination on the part of a
local group's main political actors that no one of its members should be
allowed to dominate the others." These societies actively developed what
Boehm called "reverse dominance hierarchies," where any individual
attempting to gain power over others faced social sanctions, proving
that hierarchy is not an inevitable outcome of human organisation.

The naturalisation of hierarchy serves the interests of those in power.
The text describes how even in societies where leadership roles exist,
these positions need not be coercive or privileged. Many societies
developed intentional "levelling mechanisms" to prevent the accumulation
of power. When someone in a leadership role attempts to gain more power,
the community employs various tactics to "bring the leader back down to
earth," including criticism, ridicule, and ultimately removal if
necessary. These mechanisms have successfully functioned in numerous
societies for extended periods, demonstrating that hierarchical
authority is neither inevitable nor necessary.

Contemporary examples further disprove the inevitability of hierarchy.
The text describes how the anti-globalisation movement "proved itself to
be a global force" through non-hierarchical organisation, bringing
together "hundreds of thousands of people in cities from London, England
to Port Harcourt, Nigeria." This movement achieved significant tactical
victories, including shutting down the WTO summit in Seattle, all while
operating through horizontal consensus-building processes. Similarly,
the Zapatistas have demonstrated sustainable, non-hierarchical social
organisation on a substantial scale. These examples show that even in
our modern context, large groups can and do organise effectively without
resorting to hierarchical structures.

Human behaviour is fundamentally shaped by social structures, not by
some immutable "human nature." As the anarchist perspective emphasises,
people adapt to the institutions they live within. Under hierarchical
systems, competitive and authoritarian behaviours are rewarded; under
cooperative systems, mutual aid and solidarity flourish. The idea that
hierarchy is inevitable overlooks how modern hierarchical institutions
actively reproduce submissive/authoritarian personalities. The text
explains how "statist societies" still contain "the ability to organize
without hierarchies" and "the possibility remains to create
anti-authoritarian cultures that can bring any would-be leaders back
down to earth." Far from being inevitable, hierarchy represents just one
possible social arrangement—one that anarchists have consistently
demonstrated can be replaced with more liberatory alternatives.
