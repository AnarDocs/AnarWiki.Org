The Minangkabau are a matriarchal, stateless, and egalitarian people
living in modern-day Indonesia.

# Culture

The Minangkabau traditionally followed a law called *adat*, and today
most Minangkabau combine *adat* with an adherence to Islam. Through the
*adat* traditions, Minangkabau are matrilineal, and women have central
roles in ceremonies and land ownership.[^1]

The Minangkabau have matrilocal residency and practice "visiting
marriage" (similar to the "walking marriage" of the
"<a   href="Mosuo.md" class="wikilink" title="Mosuo">"Mosuo</a>), meaning that
the alternates between living with his biological family and visiting
his wife's family as a regular guest. Traditionally, 40 to 80 people
from 3 generations would live in a large "motherhouse" which had room
for assemblies and festivals. Because upkeep for this large building is
expensive, many Minangkabau today live in smaller dwellings.[^2]

# Decisions

Each community is a "self-governing village republic," and women have as
much power as men do.[^3] If anything, "Minang women have the upper hand
in daily decisions involving household running – they decide on the
budgeting, shopping, and kids’ education," according to field researcher
Sadiq Bhanbhro. It's true that men tend to have the more public
leadership roles, but these roles are often as figureheads: "Yes, men
have public power. But think of them as front men, representing the
community to the state or to the mosque,” said Evelyn Blackwood an
anthropologist who published ethnography on Minangkabau."[^4] Heide
Gottner-Abendroth assesses that while men make grand speeches in the
village council, "These speeches have the character of rote
performances, where everyone is in agreement before they start."[^5]

# Economy

The Minangkabau practice a gift economy, where basic needs are in the
hands of the women who pass it on to their daughters.[^6]

The Minangkabau economic is agricultural, and their staple foods include
rice, bananas, coconuts, and hot peppers.[^7]
