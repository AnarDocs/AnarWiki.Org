# Social Contract

## Overview

The **social contract** is a theory in moral and political philosophy
concerning the legitimacy of state authority over individuals. The
theory posits that individuals have consented, either explicitly or
tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority
of the state in exchange for protection of their remaining rights or
maintenance of social order.[^1]

According to this theory, society and political order are not natural
phenomena but human creations established through agreement. The social
contract supposedly provides the foundation for legitimate governmental
authority, with individuals trading natural liberty for civil rights and
state protection.

## Origins

### Classical Thought

Early formulations of social contract theory appear in ancient texts.
The Buddhist text *Mahāvastu* from the second century BCE recounts the
legend of Mahasammata, describing how early humans lived without
property, government, or laws until cosmic decay led them to appoint a
ruler in exchange for order.[^2]

The concept was articulated by Glaucon in
"<a   href="Plato.md" class="wikilink" title="Plato">Plato</a>'s *Republic*,
who described justice as arising from an agreement among people who
recognized that avoiding mutual harm was preferable to the chaos of
unlimited freedom. Glaucon portrayed the social contract as a compromise
between the best condition (doing injustice without punishment) and the
worst (suffering injustice without recourse).[^3]

"<a   href="Epicurus.md" class="wikilink" title="Epicurus">Epicurus</a> in the
fourth century BCE developed the idea that justice stems from mutual
agreement and advantage, writing that "there never was such a thing as
absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men
in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or
suffering of harm."[^4]

### Modern Formulations

The theory gained prominence during the Enlightenment, when philosophers
sought secular justifications for political authority.
"<a   href="Thomas_Hobbes.md" class="wikilink" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas
Hobbes</a> in *Leviathan* (1651) argued that in the "state of nature"
human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" due to
unlimited natural freedoms leading to perpetual conflict. To escape this
condition, individuals supposedly contract to establish an absolute
sovereign authority.[^5]

"<a   href="John_Locke.md" class="wikilink" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>'s
*Second Treatise of Government* (1689) presented a different version,
arguing that individuals in the state of nature possess natural rights
to life, liberty, and property. They form governments to protect these
rights through an impartial judge, retaining the right to revolt if the
government fails in its duties.[^6]

"<a   href="Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.md" class="wikilink"
title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s *Du Contrat
Social* (1762) offered yet another interpretation, emphasizing the
"general will" and arguing that individuals must "forfeit their rights
to the whole so that such conditions were equal for all." Rousseau's
formulation justified extensive state authority while claiming it
represented true freedom.[^7]

## Supposed Benefits

Proponents of social contract theory claim it provides several
advantages:

**Legitimacy of Authority**: The theory supposedly explains how
governmental authority can be legitimate without divine sanction. By
grounding authority in consent, it appears to reconcile individual
freedom with political obligation.

**Protection of Rights**: The contract allegedly ensures protection of
individual rights by establishing an impartial authority to enforce
agreements and prevent mutual harm.

**Social Order**: It supposedly resolves the problem of coordination
among individuals with conflicting interests by establishing shared
rules and enforcement mechanisms.

**Moral Foundation**: The theory claims to distinguish between
legitimate and illegitimate authority based on whether it stems from
genuine agreement or mere force.

## Anarchist Critique

### The Fiction of Consent

The fundamental problem with social contract theory is that no such
contract ever existed. As "<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> observed, "It was a great
fallacy on the part of Jean Jacques Rousseau to have assumed that
primitive society was established by a free contract entered into by
savages."[^8] Society preceded any deliberate agreement; humans are
inherently social beings whose collective life developed naturally
rather than through conscious contract.

The notion of "tacit consent" is particularly absurd. Bakunin called it
"a wordless, and consequently a thoughtless and will-less contract: a
revolting nonsense! An absurd fiction, and what is more, a wicked
fiction!" The theory assumes that by merely existing in a territory and
not actively resisting, individuals somehow consent to all state
authority. This reduces consent to meaninglessness - "it assumes that
while I was in a state of not being able to will, to think, to speak, I
bound myself and all my descendants into perpetual slavery."[^9]

As
"<a   href="David_Hume.md" class="wikilink" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>
noted even while supporting constitutional government, actual consent
"has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full
extent." Most governments arose through conquest and force, not
agreement.[^10]

### Society Versus State

Social contract theory systematically conflates
"<a   href="society.md" class="wikilink" title="society">society</a> with the
"<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>, treating them
as identical when they are fundamentally different. Society is "the
natural mode of existence of the human collectivity, independent of any
contract. It governs itself through customs or traditional habits, but
never by laws."[^11] Society emerged organically from human social
nature and existed long before states.

The state, conversely, is a historical institution based on domination.
As Bakunin explained, "The State is not society; it is only one of its
historical forms, as brutal as it is abstract in character.
Historically, it arose in all countries out of the marriage of violence,
rapine, and pillage — in a word, of war and conquest."[^12]

Society requires no contract because humans are naturally social; we are
"the most social" beings on earth. Revolt against society itself is
inconceivable because "society antedates and at the same time survives
every human individual." But revolt against the state is both possible
and necessary because the state is merely a temporary historical form
built on coercion.[^13]

### The Premise of Human Wickedness

Social contract theory rests on the assumption that humans are
essentially evil and require external authority to restrain their wicked
nature. Both Hobbes and Rousseau presupposed that without state
authority, humans would descend into chaos and violence.

This assumption serves to justify state power while defaming human
nature. As Bakunin noted, the theory claims "the good commences only
with the conclusion of the social contract, and, consequently, is merely
the product and very content of this contract. The good is not the
product of liberty."[^14] By this logic, human liberty itself produces
evil, and only submission to authority generates morality.

This parallels religious doctrine: "Every State, like every theology,
assumes that man is essentially wicked and bad." The similarity is no
coincidence - "politics and theology are both closely related, stemming
from the same origin and pursuing the same aim under two different
names."[^15] Both demand the sacrifice of human liberty and dignity.

### State Morality and Collective Egoism

Even if we accept the contract fiction, its moral implications are
deeply troubling. The social contract defines good and evil purely in
terms of state interests. Whatever the contract designates as serving
the common interest becomes "good," regardless of its actual moral
content.

This creates a morality limited to state boundaries. The contract "is
not the product of liberty. On the contrary, so long as men remain
isolated in their absolute individuality, enjoying all their natural
liberty, they follow one law only, that is, the law of their natural
egotism."[^16] The social contract merely transforms individual egoism
into collective egoism - "the greatest satisfaction given to the
collective egotism of a particular and limited association."[^17]

This collective egoism "excludes from its midst, as strangers and
natural enemies, the vast majority of the human species." Each state
treats all outsiders as threats, recognizing no common humanity or
universal rights. As Bakunin observed, "There is no common right, no
social contract of any kind between them; otherwise they would cease to
be independent states."[^18]

### "<a   href="Patriotism.md" class="wikilink" title="Patriotism">Patriotism</a> and the Negation of Humanity

The logical consequence of state morality is
"<a   href="patriotism.md" class="wikilink" title="patriotism">patriotism</a> -
the duty to serve one's state against all others. This "transcendent
morality" demands that citizens commit acts that would be crimes if done
for personal benefit: "to offend, oppress, rob, plunder, assassinate, or
enslave one's fellowman is ordinarily regarded as a crime. In public
life, on the other hand, from the standpoint of patriotism, when these
things are done for the greater glory of the State...it is all
transformed into duty and virtue."[^19]

The state "shatters the universal solidarity of all men on the earth,
and brings some of them into association only for the purpose of
destroying, conquering, and enslaving all the rest."[^20] It denies
humanity itself, replacing universal human solidarity with narrow
nationalism and perpetual conflict.

This explains why "ever since history began, that is, ever since States
came into existence, the political world has always been and still
continues to be the stage for high knavery and unsurpassed
brigandage."[^21] The transcendent morality of the state makes crimes
into virtues when committed for "reasons of state."

### The Necessity of Domination

Social contract theory cannot explain how a truly free people would need
government at all. If citizens possessed the wisdom and virtue to elect
worthy leaders consistently, "would it not mean that the people itself,
as a mass, had reached so high a degree of morality and of culture that
it no longer had need of either government or state?"[^22]

The theory requires an ignorant, incompetent populace needing guidance.
As Bakunin noted sarcastically, champions of the state "must have
available a more or less ignorant, immature, incompetent people, or,
bluntly speaking, a kind of canaille to govern."[^23]

Moreover, even the best individuals become corrupted by power. "Nothing
is as dangerous for man's personal morality as the habit of commanding.
The best of men, the most intelligent, unselfish, generous, and pure,
will always and inevitably be corrupted in this pursuit."[^24] The
assumption that elected leaders will govern wisely ignores the
corrupting nature of authority itself.

### Perpetual Slavery

Perhaps most damningly, social contract theory attempts to bind people
permanently to agreements they never made. The original contractors (who
never existed) supposedly bound all their descendants to perpetual
obedience. This transforms consent into hereditary slavery.

As Bakunin asked, how can a contract be legitimate "when it is an
agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we
call society" if it was never actually agreed to? The answer is that it
cannot. The social contract is "a convenient fiction" designed to
legitimize what is actually rule by force.[^25]

## Alternatives

### Free Association

Rather than imaginary contracts imposing authority, anarchists advocate
genuine "<a   href="free_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a>. True voluntary
cooperation requires no permanent binding agreements or submission to
sovereign power. Individuals and groups associate freely for mutual
benefit and retain the right to dissociate at any time.

As Bakunin proposed, legitimate social organization must be "from the
bottom up, according to the real needs and the natural tendencies of the
parties, through the free federation of individuals, associations,
communes, districts, provinces, and nations within humanity."[^26] This
federation respects individual and collective autonomy while enabling
cooperation.

### Natural Solidarity

Humans need no contract to live socially because social life is our
natural condition. We evolved as cooperative beings whose survival
depends on mutual aid and solidarity. Society emerges spontaneously from
these natural tendencies, requiring no artificial agreements or imposed
authority.

True morality likewise arises from our social nature rather than from
state commandments. Respect for others' humanity, reciprocity, and
mutual aid develop naturally in free social relations. As Bakunin
argued, "All human morality rests essentially upon respect for
humanity" - not upon obedience to authority.[^27]

### Federalism

Where coordination is needed beyond face-to-face communities,
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">federalism</a>
provides a voluntary alternative to the state. Free federations are
"founded upon the liberty for all the parties to unite or not to unite,
and with liberty for each of these always to leave a union even when
freely entered into."[^28]

Such federations coordinate action while preserving autonomy. Decisions
flow from the bottom up through freely chosen delegates rather than
being imposed from above by sovereign authority. Participants retain the
right to withdraw, ensuring relationships remain genuinely voluntary.

### Consensus

Where collective decisions are necessary,
"<a   href="consensus.md" class="wikilink" title="consensus">consensus</a>-base
assemblies allow communities to organise themselves without creating a
separate ruling class. All participate in decision-making rather than
delegating authority to representatives who inevitably form a privileged
elite.

This avoids the central fiction of representative government - that a
few can legitimately rule the many based on periodic elections. As
Bakunin observed, even in the most democratic states, "actual
self-government of the masses remains a fiction most of the time. It is
always, in fact, minorities that do the governing."[^29]

## Influence

Despite its philosophical problems, social contract theory profoundly
influenced modern political thought. The
"<a   href="United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.md" class="wikilink"
title="United States Declaration of Independence">United States
Declaration of Independence</a> drew on Lockean ideas of natural rights
and the right to revolt against unjust government, though in practice
the American state has deviated far from these principles.[^30]

The theory provided secular justification for state authority at a time
when divine right of kings was becoming untenable. It helped transition
Western political thought from theological to supposedly rational
grounds, even though it merely replaced one fiction with another.

Ironically, social contract theory's emphasis on consent and agreement
influenced later anarchist thought about genuine voluntary association,
even as anarchists rejected the theory's statist conclusions.
