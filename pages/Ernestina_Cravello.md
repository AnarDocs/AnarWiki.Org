## Revolutionary Life

Born into working-class poverty in
<a href="Northern_Italy" class="wikilink"
title="Northern Italy">Northern Italy</a>, Cravello emigrated to the
United States with her family in 1895. Like countless other workers, she
was forced into exploitation at a young age, laboring as a weaver in a
Paterson, New Jersey factory.[^1] Recognizing the inherent oppression of
the capitalist system, she joined the anarchist movement in her teens
alongside her brothers Antonio and Vittorio.[^2] She became a key member
of Paterson's Gruppo Diritto all'Esistenza (Right to an Existence
Group), fighting for the fundamental right of all people to live free
from economic and state coercion.[^3]

## Anarcha-Feminist Organizing

In 1897, Cravello co-founded the revolutionary Gruppo Emancipazione
della Donna (Women's Emancipation Group) with fellow anarchists
<a href="Maria_Roda" class="wikilink" title="Maria Roda">Maria Roda</a>
and <a href="Ninfa_Baronio" class="wikilink" title="Ninfa Baronio">Ninfa
Baronio</a>. Rejecting both capitalist exploitation and patriarchal
domination, the group advanced anarcha-feminist ideas through lectures,
writings, and cultural programs. They established the Club Femminile de
Musica e di Canto (Women's Music and Song Club) and the Teatro Sociale
(Social Theater), using art as a weapon against both church and state
authority. Their theatrical productions boldly challenged Catholic
sexual morality[^4] and depicted women not as passive victims but as
revolutionary agents of their own liberation.[^5] The group's success
inspired similar anarcha-feminist organizing across the region.[^6]

## Resistance to State Repression

In 1900, following
<a href="Gaetano_Bresci" class="wikilink" title="Gaetano Bresci">Gaetano
Bresci</a>'s assassination of the Italian monarch
<a href="Umberto_I_of_Italy" class="wikilink"
title="Umberto I of Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a>, Cravello faced
intense police harassment and surveillance. The capitalist press
attempted to demonize her as the "Queen of the Anarchists," but she
refused to be intimidated. In a powerful statement to reporters, the
young revolutionary declared: "Right to kill a tyrant?" she cried
passionately. "Right to kill a man who has crushed his people, starved
them, driven them into exile, murdered them by the score? These wretches
who were slaughtered were poor people. They did not count. Nobody cares
anything about them. Let them die like pigs... But a fat old man is shot
and the world cries out about it. Why? Was he so great, so good, so
beloved? He was a king! Kings are not like common people. They are made
of better clay. The poor man is dropped in the earth and forgotten. Yet
he was a man and a better man than any king. Oh, it is hateful!" Despite
facing a near-lynching by reactionary forces that was only prevented by
police intervention[^7], Cravello used her heightened profile to
strengthen connections between anarchist women's groups across the
northeastern United States. Her activities drew particular attention
from Italian authorities, who considered her "militant and very active"
and were especially concerned about her collaboration with the noted
anarchist <a href="Ersilia_Cavedagni" class="wikilink"

## Legacy

While Cravello later focused on raising her five children with companion
Paolo Ferre, she never abandoned her anarchist principles or belief in
the necessity of social revolution. She remained in Paterson until her
death in 1942 at age 62[^9], leaving behind a powerful legacy of
militant anarcha-feminist organizing and unwavering resistance to state
power.
