# Libertarian Socialism

**Libertarian Socialism** (sometimes called **Socialist Libertarianism**
or **Free Socialism**) is a political philosophy that advocates for the
ability of people to directly control the institutions that control them

## Overview

Libertarian socialism strives for a free and equal society, aiming to
transform work and everyday life through
<a href="Direct_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democratic">direct democratic</a> and grassroots
organization.[^1] It favors
<a href="Workers&#39;_Control" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a> of the
<a href="Means_of_Production" class="wikilink"
title="means of production">means of production</a> and the replacement
of
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
with a system of <a href="Cooperative_Economics" class="wikilink"
title="cooperative economics">cooperative economics</a> or
<a href="Common_Ownership" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">common ownership</a>.[^2]

Libertarian socialists view the working class as agents of
<a href="Social_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a>, reject
<a href="Representative_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a> and
<a href="Electoralism" class="wikilink"
title="electoralism">electoralism</a>, and advocate for
<a href="Self-Organisation" class="wikilink"
title="self-organisation">self-organisation</a> and
<a href="Direct_Action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a> as means to engage in class struggle. The movement upholds
liberties such as <a href="Freedom_of_Choice" class="wikilink"
title="freedom of choice">freedom of choice</a>,
<a href="Freedom_of_Expression" class="wikilink"
title="freedom of expression">freedom of expression</a>, and
<a href="Freedom_of_Thought" class="wikilink"
title="freedom of thought">freedom of thought</a>, while maintaining
that true freedom requires the abolition of capitalist property
relations.

### Anti-Authoritarianism

Libertarian socialism takes a fundamentally anti-authoritarian approach,
rejecting <a href="Parliamentarism" class="wikilink"
title="parliamentarism">parliamentarism</a> and
<a href="Bureaucracy" class="wikilink"
title="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> in favor of empowering individuals
to control their own lives through voluntary cooperation rather than
state control.[^3] Unlike
<a href="Authoritarian_Socialism" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian forms of socialism">authoritarian forms of
socialism</a>, it upholds a <a href="Decentralisation" class="wikilink"
title="decentralised">decentralised</a> model of self-governance based
on <a href="Free_Association" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a>.

Many libertarian socialists, following
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>, consider the state to be an inherent instrument of
landlordism and capitalism, viewing it not as a neutral institution but
as a structure designed to perpetuate hierarchy and exploitation.[^4]

### Anti-Capitalism

Libertarian socialism views corporate power as an institutional problem
rooted in the structure of capitalism itself, rather than simply the
result of individual moral failings. It opposes capitalism as an
economic system built on greed, the exploitation of labor, and coercion,
calling for its revolutionary overthrow.[^5]

Libertarian socialists reject private property as incompatible with
freedom, instead upholding individual self-ownership alongside
collective ownership of the means of production. They advocate for
<a href="Workers&#39;_Self-Management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>,
recognizing that workers can cooperate productively without supervisors
appointed by either employers or the state. The movement also supports
the elimination of social and economic inequality through the
expropriation of property from the wealthy.[^6]

## History

Libertarian socialism has a long and extensive history. While it is
generally agreed to have emerged in the aftermath of the failure of the
<a href="French_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and consequences of the
Industrial Revolution, there isn't a universally agreed upon start
point. The roots extend back to classical radicalism of the early modern
period, claiming the English
<a href="Levellers" class="wikilink" title="Levellers">Levellers</a> and
French <a href="Encyclopédistes" class="wikilink"
title="Encyclopédistes">Encyclopédistes</a> as intellectual
forerunners.[^7]

### Forerunners

*Main Article:
<a href="Forerunners_of_Libertarian_Socialism" class="wikilink"
title="Forerunners of Libertarian Socialism">Forerunners of Libertarian
Socialism</a>*

There are a significant number of historical movements, societies and
revolutions which some authors have argued constitute examples of
forerunners to anarchism. Some common examples given are as follows:

- Various revolutions that occurred in ancient cities, such as Cayonu
  Tepesi, Taosi and Athens
- Certain philosophies that developed in ancient China and ancient
  Greece, such as Taoism, Agriculturalism, Cynics and Stoics
- Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam
- Various heretic movements and peasant rebellions in medieval Europe
- Certain indigenous nations and alliances in North America

### Emergence

Libertarian socialism first emerged from the anti-authoritarian faction
of the
<a href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA), after it was expelled from the
organisation by the Marxist faction at the Hague Congress of 1872.[^8]
<a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> had rejected
<a href="Karl_Marx" class="wikilink" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s
calls for a "dictatorship of the proletariat," prophetically warning
that it would only create a new ruling class composed of a privileged
minority using the state to oppress the working classes. He concluded
that "no dictatorship can have any other aim than to perpetuate itself,
and it can only give rise to and instill slavery in the people that
tolerates it."[^9]

This put libertarian socialists into direct competition with
<a href="Social_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="social democrats">social democrats</a> and
<a href="Communism" class="wikilink" title="communists">communists</a>
for influence over left-wing politics. Libertarian socialism proved
attractive to British writers such as
<a href="Edward_Carpenter" class="wikilink"
title="Edward Carpenter">Edward Carpenter</a>,
<a href="Oscar_Wilde" class="wikilink" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar
Wilde</a>, and
<a href="William_Morris" class="wikilink" title="William Morris">William
Morris</a>, who developed a vision based on a strong critique of
civilization itself.[^10]

By the early 20th century, libertarian socialists had gained leading
influence over the left in the Netherlands, France, and Italy, going on
to play major roles in the Mexican and Russian Revolutions.[^11]

### Russian Revolution

Russian libertarian socialists, including anarchists, populists, and
left socialist-revolutionaries, led the opposition to Tsarist autocracy
throughout the late 19th century. They created networks of both
clandestine and legal organisations throughout Russia, aiming to
overthrow the Russian nobility and bring land under common ownership of
the mir. Their agitation for land reform culminated in the establishment
of rural soviets during the 1905 Revolution.[^12]

Anarchists also organised among the urban proletariat, forming
clandestine factory committees that proved more attractive to
revolution-minded workers than the more reformist trade unions favoured
by the Bolsheviks. During the 1917 Revolution, in which libertarian
socialists played a leading role, the Bolsheviks temporarily adopted
elements of the libertarian socialist programme. But by 1919, the new
Bolshevik government viewed libertarian socialists as a threat and moved
to eliminate their influence, banning their organisations and arresting,
deporting, or executing many members through the Cheka.[^13]

### Spanish Revolution

Libertarian socialism reached its apex with the
<a href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>,
representing "the largest and most successful revolution against
capitalism to ever take place in any industrial economy."[^14]

In Spain, traditional forms of self-management and common ownership
dated back centuries. Building on this foundation, the Spanish
libertarian socialist movement grew through sustained agitation and the
establishment of alternative institutions. A series of workers'
congresses debated and refined proposals for constructing a libertarian
socialist society, with resolutions published in widely distributed
periodicals like *Solidaridad Obrera* and *Tierra y Libertad*. By the
outbreak of the revolution, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT counted 1.5
million members.[^15]

During the revolution, the means of production were brought under
workers' control and worker cooperatives formed the basis for the new
economy. According to
<a href="Gaston_Leval" class="wikilink" title="Gaston Leval">Gaston
Leval</a>, the CNT established an agrarian federation in the Levante
encompassing 78% of Spain's most arable land, with 40% of the region's
1,650,000 people living on 900 self-organised agrarian collectives.[^16]

Although industrial and agricultural production reached its highest
levels in anarchist-controlled areas, and anarchist militias displayed
the strongest military discipline, liberals and communists blamed
"sectarian" libertarian socialists for the Republic's defeat in the
Spanish Civil War—charges that contemporary libertarian socialists like
<a href="Robin_Hahnel" class="wikilink" title="Robin Hahnel">Robin
Hahnel</a> and
<a href="Noam_Chomsky" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> have disputed as lacking substantial evidence.[^17]

### Decline and Revival

Following the Spanish Civil War, libertarian socialism fell into decline
as left-wing politics came to be dominated by social democracy and
Marxism-Leninism. The reformist successes of trade unions made the
libertarian socialists' anti-reformist message difficult to spread, and
their platform of workers' self-management failed to appeal broadly to
industrial workers.[^18]

Libertarian socialism experienced a revival during the 1960s as part of
the nascent
<a href="New_Left" class="wikilink" title="New Left">New Left</a>. This
revival often occurred unconsciously, as new leftists reinvented
concepts like grassroots democracy, workers' control, solidarity, and
autonomy. The New Left became disillusioned with mainstream social
democratic and Marxist-Leninist groupings due to the capitalistic
tendencies of the former and rigid authoritarianism of the latter.[^19]

A specific libertarian socialist tendency emerged, with anarchists
adopting the term to avoid negative connotations while libertarian
Marxists used it to distinguish themselves from authoritarian
socialists.[^20]
<a href="Noam_Chomsky" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> became the most prominent spokesperson for libertarian
socialism, championing a vision that upheld individual liberty and
self-ownership while advocating for anti-authoritarian social
transformation.[^21]

### Contemporary Experiments

Since the end of the Cold War, there have been two major experiments in
libertarian socialism: the
<a href="Zapatista_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista Uprising">Zapatista Uprising</a> in Mexico and the
<a href="Rojava" class="wikilink" title="Rojava Revolution">Rojava
Revolution</a> in Syria.

In 1994, the
<a href="Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation" class="wikilink"
title="Zapatista Army of National Liberation">Zapatista Army of National
Liberation</a> (EZLN) rose up against NAFTA and privatisation of
indigenous lands, enabling formation of a self-governing autonomous
territory in Chiapas. The Zapatistas have rejected political
sectarianism and ideological doctrine, with spokesman
<a href="Subcomandante_Marcos" class="wikilink"
title="Subcomandante Marcos">Subcomandante Marcos</a> declaring "I shit
on all the revolutionary vanguards of this planet," becoming an
inspiration for libertarian socialists worldwide.[^22]

In 2012, the Rojava Revolution established the Autonomous Administration
of North and East Syria to put "libertarian socialist ideas into
practice," with observers drawing parallels to both the Zapatista
uprising and the Spanish Revolution of 1936, noting the influence of
<a href="Murray_Bookchin" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>'s concept of libertarian
municipalism.[^23]

*\*An additional subdivision within individualist anarchism may be the
difference between its early American and European branches. Most
American individualist anarchists advocated for mutualism, while
European individualist anarchists were pluralists who advocated for
anarchism without adjectives and synthesis anarchism, ranging from
anarcho-communist to mutualist economic types.*

## Debates

### Priorities

While most libertarian socialists recognize the need to combat both
economic and political power simultaneously, some debate which should
take priority. Some, such as <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
<a href="Alexander_Berkman" class="wikilink"
title="Alexander Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>, considered capitalism
to rely fundamentally on state support and protection, concluding that
abolishing the state would cause capitalism to naturally dissolve.
Others, including
<a href="Noam_Chomsky" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a>, argue that the state is primarily oppressive due to its
control by a plutocratic class, and that while government can at least

### Criticism

title="Criticism of Libertarian Socialism">Criticism of Libertarian
Socialism</a>*

Libertarian socialism is often viewed as unfeasible, dangerous, too
optimistic about human nature, or unable to organise certain key
societal infrastructures without centralisation. Some scholars argue
that historical attempts to implement libertarian socialist systems—such
as during the Spanish Revolution—struggled with practical challenges
like coordinating defense or maintaining economic efficiency without
centralized structures. However, libertarian socialists counter that
these difficulties often resulted from external sabotage by
authoritarian leftists and fascists, resource constraints due to civil
war conditions, and active suppression by state powers rather than
inherent flaws in libertarian socialist organisation itself.
