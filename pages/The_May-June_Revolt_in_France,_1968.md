In May and June of 1968, a wave of riots and occupations swept France
and nearly 10 million workers went on strike. The uprising enjoyed
strong popular support; on May 8, a poll by the French Institute of
Public Opinion found that four-fifths of the country sympathized with
students in Paris who had been rioting for several days.[^1] With the
influence of the Situationist International, radically
anti-authoritarian and utopian slogans appeared on walls across the
country. "Be realistic: demand the impossible." "Live without dead
time." "Boredom is counterrevolutionary." "Happiness is hanging your
landlord." "No forbidding allowed."[^2]

The economy was brought to a halt, and the conservative president
Charles de Gaulle even temporarily fled the country.[^3] However,
workers stopped short of actually reopening and self-managing the
factories they occupied, and in June the country re-elected de Gaulle.
*An Anarchist FAQ* offers the following explanation for why the revolt
failed in the short-term:

> So why did this revolt fail? Certainly not because "vanguard"
> Bolshevik parties were missing. It was infested with them.
> Fortunately, the traditional authoritarian left sects were isolated
> and outraged. Those involved in the revolt did not require a vanguard
> to tell them what to do, and the "workers' vanguards" frantically ran
> after the movement trying to catch up with it and control it.
>
> \[I\]t was the lack of independent, self-managed confederal
> organisations to co-ordinate struggle which resulted in occupations
> being isolated from each other. So divided, they fell. In addition,
> Murray Bookchin argues that *"an awareness among the workers that the
> factories had to be worked, not merely occupied or struck,"* was
> missing.[^4]

The Communist Party played a role in suppressing the revolution.
Crimethinc summarizes the conclusions of May 1968 participants Daniel
Cohn-Bendit and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit: "The Communist CGT union negotiated
a settlement with the government to get the workers back to work, and
when the workers they claimed to represent refused en masse, they
functioned as strikebreakers."[^5]

In the longer term, however, it can be argued that the uprising
dramatically changed world history. Immanuel Wallerstein argues that the
*world revolution of 1968*, in which France figured prominently,
transformed global political common sense. New cultural mores of
anti-racism, feminism, and sexual revolution entered the mainstream, and
a critique of US imperialism and the bureaucracy of the Old Left became
vastly more legitimate.[^6]

Some anarchists and libertarian Marxists argue that the workers',
feminist, black liberation, indigenous and other struggles of the 1960s
caused the breakdown in the 1970s of Keynesian policies and the
so-called golden age of capitalism. "As the revolt against exploitation
grew," John Holloway writes, "both in its monetised and non-monetised
forms, the extraction of surplus value became more and more difficult
for capital."[^7] According to this explanation, the struggles succeeded
in putting the entire world capitalist system into a major crisis.
Neoliberalism, then, was a counter-revolution, an attempt by the ruling
class to "recover after the revolution of 1968."[^8]

>
> The May-June events in France placed anarchism back on the radical
> landscape after a period in which many people had written the movement
> off as dead. This revolt of ten million people grew from humble
> beginnings. Expelled by the university authorities of Nanterre in
> Paris for anti-Vietnam War activity, a group of anarchists (including
> Daniel Cohn-Bendit) promptly called a protest demonstration. The
> arrival of 80 police enraged many students, who quit their studies to
> join the battle and drive the police from the university.
>
> Inspired by this support, the anarchists seized the administration
> building and held a mass debate. The occupation spread, Nanterre was
> surrounded by police, and the authorities closed the university down.
> The next day, the Nanterre students gathered at the Sorbonne
> University in the centre of Paris. Continual police pressure and the
> arrest of over 500 people caused anger to erupt into five hours of
> street fighting. The police even attacked passers-by with clubs and
> tear gas.
>
> A total ban on demonstrations and the closure of the Sorbonne brought
> thousands of students out onto the streets. Increasing police violence
> provoked the building of the first barricades. Jean Jacques Lebel, a
> reporter, wrote that by 1 a.m., *"\[l\]iterally thousands helped build
> barricades. . . women, workers, bystanders, people in pyjamas, human
> chains to carry rocks, wood, iron."* An entire night of fighting left
> 350 police injured. On May 7th, a 50,000-strong protest march against
> the police was transformed into a day-long battle through the narrow
> streets of the Latin Quarter. Police tear gas was answered by molotov
> cocktails and the chant *"Long Live the Paris Commune!"*
>
> By May 10th, continuing massive demonstrations forced the Education
> Minister to start negotiations. But in the streets, 60 barricades had
> appeared and young workers were joining the students. The trade unions
> condemned the police violence. Huge demonstrations throughout France
> culminated on May 13th with one million people on the streets of
> Paris.
>
> Faced with this massive protest, the police left the Latin Quarter.
> Students seized the Sorbonne and created a mass assembly to spread the
> struggle. Occupations soon spread to every French University. From the
> Sorbonne came a flood of propaganda, leaflets, proclamations,
> telegrams, and posters. Slogans such as ***"Everything is Possible,"
> "Be Realistic, Demand the Impossible," "Life without Dead Times,"***
> and ***"It is Forbidden to Forbid"*** plastered the walls. ***"All
> Power to the Imagination"*** was on everyone's lips. As Murray

> not simply scarcity and material need, but also **quality of everyday
> life . . . the attempt to gain control of one's own destiny.**"*

> Many of the most famous slogans of those days originated from the

> Every other form of revolutionary struggle has ended up with the very

> rewaking of senses that people never thought they possessed."* \[**Op.
