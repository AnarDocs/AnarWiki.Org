## History

### Beginnings

Following a complex power struggle that emerged in the country after the
collapse of the Russian and Chinese Empires. In reaction to a theocratic
government, socialist revolutionaries, with the help of Russia,

### Early Years and World War II

At the time, Mongolia was severely underdeveloped. Industry was
nonexistent and all wealth was controlled by the nobility and religious
establishments. The population numbered less than a million people and
was shrinking due to nearly half of all Mongolian males living in
monasteries.

In 1928,
<a href="Joseph_Stalin" class="wikilink" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph
Stalin</a> ordered the collectivisation of Mongolian agriculture. This
led to an economic crisis, which resulted in uprisings in the West and
the South that could only be suppressed with the help of the Soviet
Union. After this failure, livestock remained in private hands. The
state began to develop industry based on processing of animal husbandry
products and crop raising on state farms. Transportation,
communications, domestic and foreign trade, and banking and finance were
nationalised or taken over by <a href="Cooperative" class="wikilink"

In 1934, Peljidiin Genden (first president of socialist Mongolia)
visited Moscow and angrily accused Stalin of "Red imperialism". He
subsequently died in the
<a href="Great_Purge_(USSR)" class="wikilink" title="Great Purge">Great
Purge</a> after being tricked into taking a holiday on the Black Sea.
The USSR also placed soldiers into the country in 1936 in response to
aggression into China by the <a href="Japanese_Empire" class="wikilink"
title="Japanese Empire">Japanese Empire</a>. Several battles occurred on
the border in an undeclared war during
<a href="World_War_II" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War

the USSR, Mongolian volunteers also fought in the
<a href="Red_Army_(USSR)" class="wikilink" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>
against
<a href="Nazi_Germany" class="wikilink" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi
Germany</a>. Mongolia was also used as the main base to launch the
USSR's invasion of Manchuria, a key point in causing Japan's surrender.

### Cold War

After World War II, Stalin negotiated Mongolia's independence from the
<a href="Kuomingtang" class="wikilink"
title="Kuomingtang">Kuomingtang</a> in China. Mongolia had been an
incredibly isolated country, only remaining in contact with the USSR and
focusing on economic development. It opened up relations with much of
Eastern Europe,
<a href="North_Korea" class="wikilink" title="North Korea">North
Korea</a> and <a href="China" class="wikilink" title="China">China</a>.
In the 1950s China provided much needed economic aid, helping to build
apartment blocks and infrastructure with Chinese workers. The country
also began massive investment into mining, timber processing and
consumer goods production. However, during the
<a href="Sino-Soviet_Split" class="wikilink"
title="Sino-Soviet Split">Sino-Soviet Split</a>, Mongolia firmly sided
with the USSR and the USSR stationed soldiers in the country.

### Collapse

After the attempted liberalisation of the USSR, many university students
in Mongolia took inspiration and launched
<a href="Mongolian_Revolution_(1990)" class="wikilink"
title="massive protests in 1990">massive protests in 1990</a>, which led
to the <a href="democratisation" class="wikilink"

the end of the Marxist-Leninist state. However, the communists were only
voted out in 1996.

Much like the collapse of most socialist nations, Mongolia's went
through a severe economic crisis, with GDP falling by 80% between 1989
and 1993, population growth also roughly halved. However, Mongolia did
not suffer a noticeable loss of life expectancy.
