On 30 November 1999, 75,000 people demonstrated in Seattle and
successfully shut down a summit of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Anarchists organized most of the direct action components and engaged in
many activities including street blockades, serving food, and breaking
the windows of corporate property. They succeeded in “preventing the
opening ceremonies from, well, opening.” Around the world, people
protested as part of a global day of action. Days into the summit,
African and Caribbean delegates walked out and shut down the conference
entirely. Over six hundred protesters were arrested in Seattle.[^1]
Bringing critiques of neoliberal “free trade” and corporate power to the
forefront of people’s attention worldwide, the demonstrations played an
enormous role in attracting new participants and supporters to the
"<a   href="alter-globalization_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="alter-globalization movement">alter-globalization movement</a>.

The demonstrations involved a diverse range of tactics including the
delegates’ walkout and activists’ permitted marches, nonviolent civil
disobedience, and property destruction. To this day, people argue about
which tactics were more effective than others, but the combination did
capture global headlines, delay the summit’s opening, and prevent the
WTO from reaching agreement. According to the Global Nonviolent Action
Database, the campaign “was extremely successful.”[^2]

# Planning

The direct actions emerged out of calls to action issued by Peoples’
Global Action (PGA), a network that had grown out of the Zapatistas’
international *encuentros* “for humanity and against neoliberalism.” At
a nonviolent direct action training organized by the Ruckus Society (a
nonprofit organization with links to the direct action movement), people
formed the Direct Action Network (DAN) in order to coordinate the
Seattle protests. DAN organized horizontally using consensus
decision-making.[^3] San Francisco Art and Revolution, the *Earth First!
Journal*, and many other groups helped publicize the impending WTO
shutdown.[^4]

The protests targeted the WTO, a global trade body dominated by the
Global North and biased against poorer nations. Trade talks tended to
pressure nations to weaken labor and environmental negotiations in the
interests of “free trade.” The overall narrative of the protests was
captured by Rainforest Action Network’s banner drop from a Seattle crane
a week before the shutdown. The banner showed two arrows pointing in
opposite directions. One arrow said “Democracy.” The other said “WTO.”
[^5]

Prior to the WTO summit’s 30 November opening (a date activists called
N30), many direct action participants stayed at 420 Denny Space, where
Anarchists ran trainings and skill shares, fed participants, and
mass-produced lock-boxes (tar-covered PVC pipes, through which
protesters link arms so it’s difficult for police to move them).[^6]
Actually, Earth First!’s direct action manual says this was the first
time activists built lock-boxes out of PVC pipes instead of heavier
metal pipes.[^7]

Affinity groups composed of DAN members took responsibility for blocking
certain “slices” of the circular area around the convention center, in
order to stop WTO delegates from getting in.[^8] The strategy was
modeled on the 1972 protests against the Republican Convention in Miami,
when protesters blocked delegates from attending (and a riot
started).[^9]

Early in the morning on 30 November, DAN affinity groups swarmed the
streets, successfully blocking WTO delegates’ entrance. A delegate asked
a police officer, “How do we get inside?” The cop responded, “Well,
sir...right now there *is* no way to get inside.” Opening ceremonies
were canceled.[^10]

Police responded very brutally with tear gas and rubber bullets.[^11]
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Washington State later
condemned the police violence: “Police repeatedly used force --
especially chemical weapons -- in ways that were more aggressive and
heavy-handed than the situation warranted.”[^12]

## Labor

Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO, a labor union with a conservative, pro-business
leadership, led a permitted, non-disruptive march far from the direct
actions. In Crimethinc’s analysis, “the AFL-CIO’s strategic target was
supporting and legitimating President Clinton’s actions at the
conference through purely symbolic displays by a loyal opposition.”[^13]
The union's messaging stayed clear of criticizing the administration or
the pro-WTO president.[^14]

Many rank-and-file unionists, however, broke away from that march and
joined DAN’s more disruptive demonstrations.[^15] Some unionists
overcame the mainstream labor movement’s traditional antagonism toward
environmentalism. They marched alongside with environmentalists dressed
as sea turtles and holding signs “Teamsters and Turtles, Together at
Last.”[^16]

Members of the
"<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) and
"<a   href="Earth_First!.md" class="wikilink" title="Earth First!">Earth
First!</a> organized rank-and-file members of the longshore workers and
steelworkers to join the direct actions:

> Both the IWW and Earth First! were part of the anti-capitalist faction
> which sought to block the negotiations from proceeding. As early as
> late Spring of 1999, at an anarcho-syndicalist “summit” we had
> organized called I-99, the Bay Area IWW took part in planning actions
> as part of the anti-WTO protests. These consisted of several efforts:
> (1) organizing a large contingent of IWW members and like minded class
> struggle unionists to protest in Seattle; (2) Organizing rank and file
> members of the ILWU to push for a vote to shut down the west coast
> ports during the WTO negotiations; (3) bringing large numbers of the
> United Steelworkers who were still engaged in a struggle with Kaiser
> Aluminum (owned by Maxxam corporation) and were working alongside
> Earth First! against their common adversary, Charles Hurwitz; (4)
> supporting various Seattle public workers unions, including the bus
> drivers, whose contracts were up at the time and whose bosses were
> pushing for concessions.[^17]

# Black Bloc

About 100 to 200 people, mostly Anarchists, formed a black bloc, meaning
they dressed in black and wore bandannas or masks to disguise their
identities from police and bosses.[^18] Many of them had come from
backgrounds in Earth First! and the radical ecological movement.[^19] On
the evening of 29 November and the afternoon of 30 November, the black
bloc attacked the private property of multinational corporations.

Communications scholars have since found that the black bloc “catapulted
the protests into national headlines” and thus “drew more \[media\]
attention to the issues.”[^20]

The ACME Collective explained that the bloc attacked:

> Fidelity Investment (major investor in Occidental Petroleum, the bane
> of the U’wa tribe in Colombia), Bank of America, US Bancorp, Key Bank
> and Washington Mutual Bank (financial institutions key in the
> expansion of corporate repression) Old Navy, Banana Republic and the
> GAP (as Fisher family businesses, rapers of Northwest forest lands and
> sweatshop laborers) NikeTown and Levi’s (whose overpriced products are
> made in sweatshops) McDonald’s (slave-wage fast-food peddlers
> responsible for destruction of tropical rainforests for grazing land
> and slaughter of animals) Starbucks (peddlers of an addictive
> substance whose products are harvested at below-poverty wages by
> farmers who are forced to destroy their own forests in the process)
> Warner Bros. (media monopolists) Planet Hollywood (for being Planet
> Hollywood).[^21]

Authors of the statement included future
"<a   href="Earth_Liberation_Front.md" class="wikilink"
title="Earth Liberation Front">Earth Liberation Front</a> members Daniel
McGowan and Suzanne Savoie (the latter of whom informed on ELF
co-defendants during Operation Backfire) [^22]

Jeffrey St. Clair reported from the ground that the black bloc were very
mindful and targeted in their actions:

> The manager of Starbucks whined about how “mindless vandals” destroyed
> his window and tossed bags of French Roast onto the street. But the
> vandals weren’t mindless. They didn’t bother the independent
> streetside coffee shop across the way. Instead, they lined up and
> bought cup after cup. No good riot in Seattle could proceed without a
> cup of espresso.[^23]

In response to police violence, some black bloc participants threw
bottles and rocks and dragged dumpsters to the streets and lit them on
fire.[^24] In addition, about 100 local teenagers started looting and
graffiting.[^25] Anarchists were generally thrilled by these teenagers’
participation. For example, a person in the documentary *Breaking the
Spell* says:

> There was this big, big push before the WTO happened to get people
> from diverse backgrounds and something other than the activist,
> middle-class thing that was going on. It happened very spontaneously.
> People with the reason to be fucking shit up, people who have the most
> reason to be breaking the windows of Nike, were doing it. And that was
> one of the best aspects of it. People who needed shoes were breaking
> the windows and getting shoes. And that’s the way it should be.[^26]

## Peace Police

Some pacifists—derided as “peace police”—attacked black bloc
participants and tried to get them arrested. ACME Collective reports,
“On at least 6 separate occasions, the so-called ‘nonviolent’ activists
physically attacked individuals who targeted corporate property. Some
even went so far as to stand in front of the Niketown super store and
shove the Black Bloc away.”[^27]

Lori Wallach of Public Citizen claims that on 29 November, unionists
“picked up” Anarchists and carried them to the police:

> Our people actually picked up the anarchists. Because we had with us
> steelworkers and longshoremen who, by sheer bulk, were three or four
> times larger. So we had them literally just sort of, a teamster on
> either side, just pick up an anarchist. We’d walk him over to the cops
> and say this boy just broke a window. He doesn’t belong to us. We hate
> the WTO, so does he, maybe, but we don’t break things. Please arrest
> him.[^28]

Medea Benjamin was quoted in the *New York Times* as having asked on 30
November, “Where are the police? These anarchists should have been
arrested.”[^29]

# Where was the color?

Elizabeth Betita Martinez criticizes how N30 organizers did not, by and
large, make a concerted effort to inform people of color about the WTO
or bring them to Seattle. People of color only comprised an estimated 5
percent of the demonstrators.

> Among community activists of color, the Indigenous Environmental
> Network (IEN) delegation led by Tom Goldtooth conducted an impressive
> program of events with Native peoples from all over the U.S. and the
> world. A 15-member multi-state delegation represented the Southwest
> Network for Environmental and Economic Justice based in Albuquerque,
> which embraces 84 organizations primarily of color in the U.S. and
> Mexico; their activities in Seattle were binational. Many activist
> youth groups of color came from California, especially the Bay Area,
> where they have been working on such issues as Free Mumia, affirmative
> action, ethnic studies, and rightwing laws like the current
> Proposition 21 "youth crime" initiative. Seattle-based forces of color
> that participated actively included the Filipino Community Center and
> the international People’s Assembly, which led a march on Tuesday
> despite being the only one denied a permit

Betita Martinez summarizes:

> Yet if only a small number of people of color went to Seattle, all
> those with whom I spoke found the experience extraordinary. They spoke
> of being changed forever. "I saw the future." "I saw the possibility
> of people working together." They called the giant mobilization "a
> shot in the arm," if you had been feeling stagnant.[^30]

# Global Action

In the days leading up to N30, people took direct action around the
world. Three thousand rallied in Seoul, South Korea. 75,000 protested in
eighty cities across France. Students in Milan, Italy occupied a
university’s biology facilities in protest of the WTO’s imposition of
biotechnology. People performed street theater in Santos, Brazil. Food
Not Bombs distributed food and leaflets in Prague, Czech Republic. In
Haifax, England, Earth First!ers occupied a Nestle factory. In
Manchester, England, fifty people occupied a bank branch and blockaded a
road. In Lille, France, twelve banks were painted red. In Narmada
Valley, India, more than 1,000 demonstrated. In Nashville, activists
occupied Vice President and Democratic Party presidential candidate Al
Gore’s campaign offices with a giant Ronald McDonald puppet. Groups
occupied a road in Buenos Aires, Argentina. More than 8,000 marched in
Pakistan with a “Shut down the WTO” banner.[^31]
