# History

## Origins

The roots of syndicalism can be traced to the
<a href="International_Workingmen&#39;s_Association" class="wikilink"
title="International Workingmen&#39;s Association">International
Workingmen's Association</a> (IWA), where the anti-authoritarian faction
advocated for
<a href="trade_union" class="wikilink" title="trade union">trade
unions</a> to overthrow the
<a href="State" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> through a
<a href="general_strike" class="wikilink" title="general strike">general
strike</a>.[^1] This syndicalist approach was adopted by anarchists in
<a href="Spain" class="wikilink" title="Spain">Spain</a>,
<a href="Cuba" class="wikilink" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>,
<a href="Mexico" class="wikilink" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the
<a href="United_States" class="wikilink" title="United States">United
States</a>, where it became the dominant organisational form among
libertarian movements.[^2]

## Revolutionary Syndicalism

Revolutionary syndicalism first emerged in
<a href="France" class="wikilink" title="France">France</a> through the
establishment of *<a href="Bourse_du_Travail" class="wikilink"
title="Bourses du Travail">Bourses du Travail</a>* (Labour Exchanges),
which provided
<a href="mutual_aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
to workers and organised strike actions.[^3] These labour exchanges
eventually formed the
<a href="General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France)" class="wikilink"
title="General Confederation of Labour">General Confederation of
Labour</a> (CGT), which grew to include 60% of French workers and
successfully won the <a href="eight-hour_day" class="wikilink"
title="eight-hour day">eight-hour day</a> and the
<a href="weekend" class="wikilink" title="weekend">weekend</a> through
general strike action.[^4]

By the 1910s, revolutionary syndicalism had spread throughout Europe,
with syndicalist unions emerging in the
<a href="Netherlands" class="wikilink"
title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>,
<a href="Italy" class="wikilink" title="Italy">Italy</a>,
<a href="Portugal" class="wikilink" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>,
<a href="Germany" class="wikilink" title="Germany">Germany</a> and
<a href="Sweden" class="wikilink" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>.[^5] The
concurrent development of <a href="industrial_unionism" class="wikilink"
title="industrial unionism">industrial unionism</a> led to the formation
of the <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) across the English-speaking world.[^6]

## War and Revolution

The outbreak of
<a href="World_War_I" class="wikilink" title="World War I">World War
I</a> divided syndicalists between internationalist and defencist
positions, ultimately discrediting "neutral syndicalism" as workers
witnessed the movement's inability to prevent war.[^7] During the
<a href="Revolutions_of_1917–1923" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutions of 1917–1923">Revolutions of 1917–1923</a>,
syndicalists became active participants in revolutionary movements
throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia, though these uprisings were
ultimately suppressed by nationalist or communist dictatorships.[^8]

## Spanish Revolution

Syndicalism reached its apex during the
<a href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a>, when
the <a href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo" class="wikilink"
title="National Confederation of Labour">National Confederation of
Labour</a> (CNT) led the defeat of fascist forces in
<a href="Catalonia" class="wikilink" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> and
established a revolutionary economy that
<a href="Collectivisation" class="wikilink"
title="collectivised">collectivised</a> three-quarters of the Republican
territories.[^9] This represented the most successful implementation of
syndicalist principles in practice, demonstrating workers' capacity for
self-organisation and economic management.

## Decline and Revival

Following
<a href="World_War_II" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a>, syndicalism experienced rapid decline as unions were either
marginalised by <a href="social_corporatism" class="wikilink"
title="social corporatism">social corporatism</a> or repressed by
authoritarian states.[^10] However, the movement began experiencing
revival following the <a href="protests_of_1968" class="wikilink"
title="protests of 1968">protests of 1968</a> and has seen renewed
growth in response to <a href="globalisation" class="wikilink"
title="globalisation">globalisation</a> and
<a href="neoliberalism" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>.[^11]

# Theory

## Anti-Political Approach

Syndicalism maintains an <a href="anti-politics" class="wikilink"
title="anti-political">anti-political</a> stance, rejecting
participation in <a href="parliamentary_politics" class="wikilink"
title="parliamentary politics">parliamentary politics</a> and the
formation of political parties.[^12] Syndicalists argue that political
participation corrupts the labour movement by substituting
<a href="representative_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a> for
workers' <a href="self-organisation" class="wikilink"
title="self-organisation">self-organisation</a>, leading to the
abandonment of <a href="anti-capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalism</a> in favour of
<a href="nationalism" class="wikilink"
title="nationalism">nationalism</a>.[^13]

## Direct Action

Central to syndicalist practice is
<a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
action</a>, which includes
<a href="boycott" class="wikilink" title="boycott">boycotts</a>,
<a href="sabotage" class="wikilink" title="sabotage">sabotage</a> and
<a href="strike_action" class="wikilink" title="strike action">strike
actions</a>. These methods allow workers to directly confront their
employers and force concessions without relying on political
intermediaries.[^14] Strike actions are viewed as "revolutionary drill"
that prepare workers for the eventual overthrow of capitalism and the
state.

## Federalism

Syndicalist organisations operate according to
<a href="federalist" class="wikilink" title="federalist">federalist</a>
principles, with unions maintaining autonomy while coordinating through
voluntary association.[^15] This federal structure builds from the
bottom-up, linking workplace unions into local cartels, regional
federations, and ultimately national organisations, while maintaining
democratic control and preventing bureaucratic centralisation.

## Workers' Control

The ultimate goal of syndicalism is establishing
<a href="workers&#39;_control" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; control">workers' control</a> over production and
distribution, creating a <a href="socialist_economy" class="wikilink"
title="socialist economy">socialist economy</a> managed directly by the
producers themselves.[^16] Trade unions serve as both the means to
achieve immediate improvements in working conditions and as the
foundation for a future society based on
<a href="workers&#39;_self-management" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>.

# Contemporary Relevance

Modern syndicalism continues to offer an alternative to both
<a href="state_socialism" class="wikilink" title="state socialism">state
socialism</a> and
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>,
emphasising direct worker organisation and action. Contemporary
syndicalist unions have re-emerged globally, organising strikes and
achieving reforms while maintaining their revolutionary vision of a
worker-controlled society.[^17]
