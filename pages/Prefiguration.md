# Prefiguration

## Overview

**Prefiguration** (or **prefigurative politics**) refers to the
principle that revolutionary movements should embody in their present
practices and organization the social relations they seek to create in
the future. The concept captures the anarchist commitment that means
must reflect ends, expressed in the idea of building a new world within
the shell of the old.

According to political theorists Paul Raekstad and Saio Gradin,
prefigurative politics is the deliberate experimental implementation of
desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now.[^1]
This involves creating forms of organization, decision-making, and
social relationships that prefigure the egalitarian and democratic
society that activists seek to establish.

While prefiguration has become central to contemporary anarchist
discourse and practice, the concept has also generated debate within
anarchist movements about the relationship between present action and
future transformation, the role of utopian thinking, and whether the
idea itself offers false reassurance about revolutionary possibility.

## Origins

### Historical Practice

Although the term "prefiguration" only emerged in the 1970s, the
principle of means-ends consistency has deep roots in anarchist thought.
Anarchists around the turn of the twentieth century clearly embraced the
principle that means used to achieve any end must be consistent with
that end, though they did not use the term prefiguration.[^2]

In 1868, the Belgian section of the First International argued that the
International itself carried within itself the institutions of the
society of the future.[^3] This idea became central to debates about
revolutionary organization. The 1871 Sonvilier Circular, produced by
anarchists after the Paris Commune, stated that the society of the
future should be nothing other than the universalization of the
organization with which the International had endowed itself, arguing
that it was impossible for an egalitarian and free society to emerge
from authoritarian organization.[^4]

James Guillaume, a comrade of Mikhail Bakunin, expressed this principle
directly when he wrote that one could not want an equalitarian and free
society to issue from authoritarian organization, declaring it
impossible.[^5] Bakunin himself insisted that revolutionary organization
must proceed from the bottom up, beginning with the social life of the
masses and their real aspirations, rather than forcing natural life into
the straitjacket of the state.[^6]

Emma Goldman provided one of the most powerful articulations of
means-ends unity in her afterword to My Disillusionment in Russia, where
she declared that no revolution can ever succeed as a factor of
liberation unless the means used to further it are identical in spirit
and tendency with the purposes to be achieved. She argued that means
employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and
parcel of the final purpose, such that aims and means become
identical.[^7]

### Term and Concept

The term "prefigurative politics" was introduced by social theorists
Carl Boggs and Wini Breines in the late 1970s to describe aspects of
revolutionary movements they observed. Boggs defined it as the
embodiment, within the ongoing political practice of a movement, of
those forms of social relations, decision-making, culture, and human
experience that are the ultimate goal.[^8]

Breines applied the concept to the US New Left, emphasizing
participatory democracy as central to prefigurative politics. She
described it as the attempt to embody personal and anti-hierarchical
values in politics, with the crux being to create and sustain within the
live practice of the movement relationships and political forms that
prefigured and embodied the desired society.[^9]

The concept gained widespread use in anarchist and radical movements
during the alter-globalization protests of the early 2000s and
particularly with the Occupy movements of 2011.

## Principles

### Means-Ends Consistency

At its core, prefiguration rests on the principle that there must be
consistency between means and ends in revolutionary struggle. Benjamin
Franks argues that anarchist prefiguration means that means have to
prefigure ends, steering anarchists away from both consequentialism
(judging actions by outcomes) and towards what he terms pragmatic
ethics.[^10]

This principle rejects instrumentalism, the idea that the success of a
plan is determined solely by its efficiency in meeting objectives.
Instead, prefigurative politics collapses the distinction between means
and ends, arguing that actions must embody the forms of social relation
that actors wish to see develop.[^11]

### Direct Action

Prefiguration is intimately connected to the concept of direct action.
Beyond disruptive tactics, direct action represents a principle of
action without intermediaries, where groups or individuals use their own
power to prevent injustice or fulfill desires rather than appealing to
external agents.[^12]

Through direct action, revolutionary masses can directly achieve some of
their objectives in the present. This includes direct expropriation of
resources, the immediate reconstruction of social roles and
relationships, and the creation of autonomous spaces and institutions.

### Anti-Hierarchy and Participation

Prefigurative politics emphasizes horizontal organization, participatory
democracy, and the active opposition to hierarchical and centralized
structures. This includes practices such as decision-making on the
lowest practical level, use of mandated delegates serving limited times
who are subject to immediate recall, and frequent rotation of
responsibilities.[^13]

David Graeber described how prefigurative politics demonstrates that
truly democratic society is possible not through rhetoric but through
practice. The experience of collective decision-making without
leadership structures, motivated only by principle and solidarity, can
change fundamental assumptions about what politics and human life could
be.[^14]

## Practice and Implementation

### Organizational Forms

Prefigurative practice manifests in specific organizational structures
including general assemblies, consensus decision-making processes,
affinity groups, spokescouncils, and horizontal networks. These forms
reject parliamentary procedure and representative democracy in favor of
direct participation and delegated coordination.[^15]

Movements also create alternative institutions such as community
kitchens, libraries, free schools, health clinics, and media centers
that model mutual aid and non-hierarchical cooperation while meeting
immediate needs.

### Addressing Informal Hierarchies

Contemporary prefigurative politics recognizes that formal democratic
structures alone are insufficient. Movements must also address informal
hierarchies based on race, gender, class, ability, and other axes of
oppression. This involves creating distinct caucuses for marginalized
groups, constructing accessible organizations and events, empowering
marginalized people through skill-shares and workshops, and making
members aware of informal hierarchies and how to unlearn them.[^16]

An intersectional analysis is necessary because different kinds of
oppression always intertwine and interact. Even organizations focused on
class politics inevitably have practical politics of race, gender, and
other dimensions, whether conscious or not.[^17]

### Relationship to Time

Prefigurative politics challenges the idea of revolution as a distant
future event. As expressed by activists, the revolution exists in every
moment of struggle, not in some mythic possible future. This focus on
the here and now means seeking to manifest desired futures in present
practice rather than deferring liberation to an abstract condition after
revolution.[^18]

However, this presentism has generated debate about whether it sidesteps
consideration of long-term social transformation and the generative
relationship between present and future.

## Historical Examples

### Spanish Revolution

One of the greatest examples of prefigurative politics in the 20th
century was the libertarian communism organized by anarcho-syndicalists
such as the CNT during the Spanish Civil War. Workers took collective
control of the means of production on a decentralized level, organized
autonomous municipalities, and established new forms of social
organization that embodied anarchist principles in practice.[^19]

### Zapatistas

The Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mexico, beginning in 1994,
exemplifies contemporary prefigurative politics. After initial armed
uprising, the Zapatistas developed structures of self-government,
autonomous education, healthcare, justice, and agrarian relations. They
established horizontal decision-making processes, emphasized indigenous
rights and local empowerment, and created de facto autonomy through
everyday practices.[^20]

The movement demonstrates prefigurative politics by building alternative
institutions in the present rather than waiting to seize state power.

### Rojava Movement

The autonomous region of Rojava in northern Syria, established in 2012,
embodies prefigurative politics through grassroots democracy, gender
equality, and social ecology. The movement established direct democracy,
decentralized governance, embraced a reciprocal economy, emphasized
ethnic and religious inclusivity, and championed women's rights through
policies like co-leadership and women's defense units.[^21]

### Occupy Movement

The Occupy movements of 2011 explicitly embraced prefigurative politics.
David Graeber described how Occupy Wall Street's slogan "this is what
democracy looks like" was meant literally. The movement not only
confronted forms of power but did so in ways that demonstrated why the
social relations on which that power was based were unnecessary. The
decentralized organization itself was the movement's ideology.[^22]

## Criticism and Debate

### The Problem of Utopianism

A significant debate within anarchist thought concerns the relationship
between prefiguration and utopianism. Some contemporary anarchists worry
that historical anarchism was too closely tied to blueprint utopianism,
which treats utopia as a predetermined endpoint that directs action
toward realization of fixed goals. This approach is seen as compromising
prefiguration by creating a gap between means and ends.[^23]

Critics like Saul Newman distinguish between scientific utopianism,
where future anarchist society is founded on rational principles and
will inevitably result from revolution, and utopianism of the here and
now, which focuses less on post-revolutionary society and more on
transformation of social relations in the present.[^24]

However, other scholars argue that this critique misreads historical
anarchist thought. Nineteenth-century anarchists like Bakunin and
Kropotkin were already wary of abstraction and blueprint thinking,
instead emphasizing conceptual contestability, practical
experimentation, and the creative power of people negotiating meanings
through struggle.[^25]

### False Reassurance

Uri Gordon raises a fundamental concern about whether prefiguration
offers false reassurance about revolutionary possibility. He argues that
the concept of prefiguration carries temporal implications drawn from
Christian theology, where the future radiates backwards on the past,
suggesting a predetermined fulfillment.[^26]

Gordon contends that while anarchist practice has historically used
generative temporal framing (where present shapes an unknown future),
the term prefiguration may hint at reassurance that an accomplished
future is already casting light on present actions. This becomes
problematic in an era of ecological collapse and converging planetary
crises, where traditional revolutionary expectations no longer seem
viable.[^27]

He suggests that the absence of revolutionary promise is now filled with
anxiety, frustration, and guilt, and that prefigurative terminology may
conveniently sidestep confrontation with bleak futures by offering vague
comfort about present relevance.

### Presentism

Some critics worry that emphasis on prefiguration in the here and now
leads to presentism that abandons long-term revolutionary goals. This
manifests in statements that treat revolution as existing in every
moment of our lives rather than as a process of fundamental social
transformation.[^28]

The turn to present-focused politics has been criticized as symptomatic
of activist networks becoming cultural scenes, abandoning revolutionary
politics for self-seeking pursuits, and neglecting movement-building and
class solidarity in favor of lifestyle choices and individual
liberation.

### Patterns of Decline

Carl Boggs identified three common patterns of decline in prefigurative
movements. Jacobinism occurs when popular forums are repressed or their
sovereignty usurped by centralized revolutionary authority. Spontaneism
results in strategic paralysis when parochial or anti-political
inclinations inhibit creation of broader structures of coordination.
Corporativism happens when an oligarchic stratum of activists is
co-opted, leading them to abandon the movement's originally radical
goals to serve their own interests in maintaining power.[^29]

These patterns suggest that prefigurative politics alone may be
insufficient without attention to questions of scale, coordination, and
maintaining revolutionary commitment over time.

### The Question of Effectiveness

Some anarchists question whether prefigurative politics can achieve
large-scale social transformation. The emphasis on means-ends
consistency and rejection of instrumentalism may limit strategic
flexibility. Organizations focused on modeling ideal relations in the
present may struggle to effectively challenge entrenched power
structures or reach beyond activist milieus to broader working-class
movements.

The historical anarchist emphasis on unions and workplace organizing is
sometimes contrasted with contemporary prefigurative politics focused on
autonomous spaces, consensus process, and lifestyle choices, raising
questions about where revolutionary power lies.

## Contemporary Significance

Despite these criticisms, prefiguration remains central to contemporary
anarchist practice. It provides a framework for understanding how social
transformation happens, addresses the paradox of self-emancipation (how
people without power can develop capacity to reorganize society), and
offers an alternative to authoritarian revolutionary strategies.[^30]

Prefigurative politics has become particularly important for movements
addressing multiple intersecting forms of oppression, for developing new
forms of struggle appropriate to contemporary conditions, and for
maintaining revolutionary commitment in the absence of traditional
guarantees about historical progress.

The concept continues to evolve through practical experimentation in
movements worldwide, from community land trusts and worker cooperatives
to autonomous zones and solidarity economies. These experiments generate
ongoing debate about the relationship between prefiguration and
revolution, present and future, means and ends.
