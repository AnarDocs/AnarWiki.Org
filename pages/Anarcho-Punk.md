Anarcho-Punk is a subgenre of
"<a   href="Punk_Rock.md" class="wikilink" title="Punk Rock Music">Punk Rock
Music</a> which originated in the 1970s that takes heavy influence from
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarchist">Anarchist</a> and
"<a   href="Anti-War_Movements.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-War">Anti-War</a> currents both historical and modern. The
subgenre is less defined by its sound and more heavily defined by its
Anarchist Lyrical content. Earlier Anarcho-Punk tended to take much
inspiration from avant-garde musicians, while modern artists whom some
classify as Anarcho-Punk blend genres which range anywhere from Hardcore
subgenres like Powerviolence and D-Beat, to more widely accessible
genres like Folk, Ska, Post-Punk, and Garage Rock. The lyrical content
always tends to include themes of Anti-Fascism, Anti-Statism, Anti-War,
and Anti-Capitalist sentiment, with many also including Animal Rights,
Labor Activism, Pacifism, and other Anarchist contentions with systems
of domination.[^1]
