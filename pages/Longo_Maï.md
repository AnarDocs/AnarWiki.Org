> Longo Maï is a network of cooperatives and autonomous villages that
> started in Basel, Switzerland, in 1972. The name is Provençal for
> “long may it last,” and so far they have lived up to their eponym. The
> first Longo Maï cooperative are the farms Le Pigeonnier, Grange neuve,
> and St. Hippolyte, located near the village Limans in Provence. Here
> 80 adults and many children live on 300 hectares of land, where they
> practice agriculture, gardening, and shepherding. They keep 400 sheep,
> poultry, rabbits, bees, and draft horses; they run a garage, a metal
> workshop, a carpentry workshop, and a textile studio. The alternative
> station Radio Zinzine has been broadcasting from the cooperative for
> 25 years, as of 2007. Hundreds of youth pass through and help out at
> the cooperative, learning new skills and often gaining their first
> contact with communal living or non-industrial agriculture and
> crafting.

> Since 1976 Longo Maï has been running a cooperative spinning-mill at
> Chantemerle, in the French Alps. Using natural dyes and the wool from
> 10,000 sheep, mostly local, they make sweaters, shirts, sheets, and
> cloth for direct sale. The cooperative established the union ATELIER,
> a network of stock-breeders and wool-workers. The mill produces its
> own electricity with smallscale hydropower.
>
> Also in France, near Arles, the cooperative Mas de Granier sits on 20
> hectares of land. They grow fields of hay and olive trees, on good
> years producing enough olive oil to provide for other Longo Maï
> cooperatives as well as themselves. Three hectares are devoted to
> organic vegetables, delivered weekly to subscribers in the broader
> community. Some of the vegetables are canned as preserves in the
> cooperative’s own factory. They also grow grain for bread, pasta, and
> animal feed.
>
> In the Transkarpaty region of Ukraine, Zeleniy Hai, a small Longo Maï
> group, started up after the fall of the Soviet Union. Here they have
> created a language school, a carpentry workshop, a cattle ranch, and a
> dairy factory. They also have a traditional music group. The Longo Maï
> network used their resources to help form a cooperative in Costa Rica
> in 1978 that provided land to 400 landless peasants fleeing the civil
> war in Nicaragua, allowing them to create a new community and provide
> for themselves. There are also Longo Maï cooperatives in Germany,
> Austria, and Switzerland, producing wine, building buildings with
> local, ecological materials, running schools, and more. In the city of
> Basel they maintain an office building that serves as a coordinating
> point, an information hub, and a visitors’ center.
>
> The call-out for the cooperative network, drafted in Basel in 1972,
> reads in part:
>
> > What do you expect from us? That we, in order not to be excluded,
> > submit to the injustice and the insane compulsions of this world,
> > without hope or expectations?
> >
> > We refuse to continue this unwinnable battle. We refuse to play a
> > game that has already been lost, a game whose only outcome is our
> > criminalization. This industrial society goes doubtlessly to its own
> > downfall and we don’t want to participate.
> >
> > We prefer to seek a way to build our own lives, to create our own
> > spaces, something for which there is no place within this cynical,
> > capitalist world. We can find enough space in the economically and
> > socially depressed areas, where the youth depart in growing numbers,
> > and only those stay behind who have no other choice.[^1]
