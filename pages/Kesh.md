# Kesh

The Kesh are a tribal society in Ursula K. Le Guin's post-apocalyptic
novel *Always Coming Home*. Unlike their neighbors the Condor, the Kesh
are peaceful and anarchistic. The Kesh have nine towns and are a
sedentary people.[^1] The novel's protagonist Stone Telling, born to a
Kesh mother and a father from the Condor, becomes torn between the two
sides of her family.

Le Guin summarizes, "The Kesh lived half in town and half in the
wilderness. They had no streets, and their farms were, by our standard,
gardens."[^2]

## Culture

The Kesh have a strong culture of gender equality, and Stone Telling is
surprised when the Condor do not share this commitment.[^3]
Homosexuality seems to be a normal practice among the Kesh, and
homosexuals are sometimes called *ginkgos* after the sexually dimorphous
gingko tree.[^4]

Much like Pravic, the language on
<a href="Anarres.md" class="wikilink" title="Anarres">Anarres</a> in Le
Guin's *The Dispossessed*, the Kesh language does not have possessive
words for relations between living beings. Someone might refer to "the
wife" but not to "my wife."[^5]

Kesh culture values mindfulness. This contrasts with the Condor practice
of putting something out of one's mind and saying "I'll think about that
later."[^6]

Children are taught in schools called *heyimas*.[^7]

## Decisions

Kesh society is divided into Houses each self-governed by a council.
Stone Telling speculates on how Houses agreed not to accept her father
from the Condor society: "I do not know why none of the Houses took my
father, but I guess that their councils saw that it would not do."[^8]

## Economy

The Kesh rely mainly on gathering and small-scale farming. Foraged foods
include different types of acorns, greens, herbs, berries, and seeds.
Farmers harvest corn, wheat, barley, and oats. Hunting is a mainly
unimportant supplement. Children do most of the hunting and eat most of
the game.[^9]

There is no private property, and in fact there is no transitive verb
"to have" in the Kesh language. One cannot be said "to have" such and
such. The word for "to be rich" is the same word as "to give,"
reflecting Kesh expectations of sharing and redistributing one's
possessions.[^10]

The Kesh pay money as a sign of honor to people who act, dance, recite,
or craft things. Money is not used as a medium of exchange.[^11]

The Kesh are almost entirely food self-reliant, although they trade for
rice.[^12]

## Environment

There are indications that the Kesh take ecological harmony very
seriously. When a Condor army builds a bridge through Kesh territory,
Kesh individuals complains that the river had not been consulted.[^13]
The Kesh never hunt an animal without giving a prayer of respect and
using every part of the animal.[^14]

## Neighboring Societies

The Kesh have a Warrior society that defends the people from outside
attackers. The Warriors are all men.[^15]
