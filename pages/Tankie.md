## Overview

**Tankie** is a pejorative term used primarily by
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchists">anarchists</a>,
<a href="democratic_socialism" class="wikilink"
title="democratic socialists">democratic socialists</a>, and other
<a href="anti-authoritarianism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> leftists to describe
<a href="Marxism-Leninism" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninists">Marxist-Leninists</a> and others who offer
uncritical support for authoritarian regimes claiming socialist
credentials. The term has expanded from its original Cold War context to
encompass those who defend any state aligned against Western powers,
regardless of that state's actual relationship to socialist principles
or working-class liberation.[^1]

From an anarchist perspective, tankies represent a fundamental betrayal
of socialist principles. As Christina Petterson noted, tankies "regard
past and current socialist systems as legitimate attempts at creating
communism, and thus have not distanced themselves from Stalin, China,
etc."[^2] This position places tankies in direct opposition to the
anarchist understanding that
<a href="the_state" class="wikilink" title="the state">the state</a> is
inherently oppressive and cannot serve as a vehicle for human
liberation.

The defining characteristic of tankie ideology is the prioritisation of
geopolitical alignments over class struggle and workers'
self-organisation. Rather than supporting working-class movements
regardless of which state they challenge, tankies reduce
anti-imperialism to simply taking the opposite side of whatever position
the United States holds.[^3]

## Origins

The term "tankie" originated within the
<a href="Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party of Great Britain">Communist Party of Great
Britain</a> (CPGB) following the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. On
27 October 1956, Peter Fryer, a CPGB member and correspondent for the
*Daily Worker*, arrived in Hungary four days into an uprising of workers
calling for worker-controlled socialism. Factories had been taken over
nationally by <a href="workers&#39;_councils" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a>, representing an
unprecedented demonstration of workers' self-organisation in an Eastern
Bloc country.[^4]

On 4 November, Soviet T-54 tanks rolled into Budapest to crush the
uprising. Street fighting continued until 10 November, although the
workers' councils held out for two months. Fryer returned to Britain
horrified by what he had witnessed, but the *Daily Worker* refused to
publish his account, adhering to the official Soviet line that the
uprising was a "fascist counter-revolutionary plot". When Fryer wrote up
his experiences independently, he was expelled from the CPGB.[^5]

Hungary 1956 split Communist parties across the world. Many who had
supported the USSR until this point became disillusioned and left, while
those who remained loyal to Moscow earned the epithet "tankie".[^6]
After 1956, the USSR was to invade Czechoslovakia in 1968, then
Afghanistan in 1979—each intervention producing further splits and
further use of the term.[^7]

The term gained wider currency during the 1980s as internal divisions
within the CPGB became public. The party had split between a
traditionalist, pro-Soviet wing associated with the *Morning Star*
newspaper (the "tankies") and a reformist, Eurocommunist wing associated
with *Marxism Today* (the "Euros").[^8] As Willie Thompson wrote in his
1992 history of the CPGB: "'Sectarians', 'traditionalists' and
'Stalinists' were all employed, the first being favoured in formal
debate, although in private conversation it was usually 'tankie', from
the support this faction had given to the Czechoslovak invasion."[^9]

The first documented uses of the term in print appeared in the student
press in the late 1970s. The Federation of Conservative Students
distributed a leaflet at the April 1978 National Union of Students
conference attacking the National Organisation of Labour Students and
the CPGB alliance as "tankies".[^10]

## Characteristics

### Trotskyist Connections

While the original "tankie" epithet grew out of splits in
Marxist-Leninist parties, geopolitical "anti-imperialist" support for
the USSR and states aligned against the USA has also been popular with
some Trotskyist groups. In the 1980s it was revealed that the Trotskyist
Workers Revolutionary Party in Britain had been receiving funding from
Libyan intelligence services and passing details of Iraqi dissidents in
the UK to Saddam Hussein.[^11]

In the USA, the Workers World Party and Party for Socialism and
Liberation both originated in a split from the Trotskyist Socialist
Workers Party under Sam Marcy. Marcy split from the SWP over the
position it took on Hungary 1956, although he also accused those who
supported the uprising of being Stalinists. Both parties now describe
themselves as Marxist-Leninist and no longer cite Trotsky, but their
origins were in the Trotskyist theory of the USSR as a "deformed workers
state."[^12]

This demonstrates that support for crushing workers' movements is shared
by both some Marxist-Leninists and some Trotskyists—one explanation
being that the actual politics of Stalin and Trotsky were not as
different as their respective followers claim.[^13]

### State-Level Focus

Research into online tankie communities has revealed a distinctive
pattern of political engagement. Analysis of over 1.3 million posts from
tankie subreddits found that tankies are "particularly vocal about major
geopolitical events" including Chinese and North Korean politics, the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. However,
"when it comes to everyday societal challenges that are usually points
of interest for the left wing—like policing, climate change, healthcare,
housing, and workers' rights—tankies seem less engaged."[^14]

This pattern reveals that tankies appear deeply invested in state-driven
political events, often at the expense of grassroots societal issues,
underscoring a distinct divergence between left-wing extremists and the
wider left community.[^15]

### Acceptance of Authoritarian State Narratives

Tankies characteristically adopt the preferred terminology and
narratives of the authoritarian states they support. Research found that
tankies often use "Communist Party of China (CPC)"—Beijing's preferred
nomenclature—rather than the more common "CCP". When discussing the
Uyghurs, tankie discussions "often diverge from the mainstream
narrative. Rather than highlighting concerns over detention and
genocide, they portray the situation in a less severe light."[^16]

Similarly, tankies show support that extends beyond nominally socialist
countries to include non-socialist autocratic states opposing NATO, such
as Putin's Russia. Research found tankies tend to use the titles of
Russian-backed de facto states like the "Luhansk People's Republic" and
"Donetsk People's Republic" when referring to occupied Ukrainian
territory.[^17]

### Stalinist Tendencies

Tankies demonstrate a marked tendency towards Stalinism, giving greater
prevalence to topics related to Stalin compared to other far-left
communities. This preference is evident in their discussions of Soviet
figures like Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev, both known for
efforts to move away from Stalin's policies. Tankies use the term
"trot"—a derogatory term for Trotskyists dating to Stalin's era—and
express hostility toward "de-Stalinisation".[^18]

### Reliance on State Media

Tankies show a stronger preference for sharing news from Chinese and
Russian state-sponsored or state-controlled sources while being less
inclined toward Western democratic outlets.[^19]

### Social Democratic Practice

Despite revolutionary rhetoric, many tankie organisations pursue
programmes that are essentially social democratic in content. The
American Party for Socialism and Liberation's programme, for example,
emphasises guaranteed jobs, union representation, pensions, healthcare,
paid leave, and a 30-hour work week—policies that resemble Scandinavian
social democracy rather than the abolition of wage labour.[^20]

Similarly, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), while holding rallies
with hammer and sickle flags, pursues pro-business policies where it
wins elections. In Kerala, the CPI-M administration stressed partnership
between management and trade unions and promised investment including
"Silicon Valley-like hubs"—hardly seizing the means of production.[^21]

## Anarchist Critique

### Betrayal of Working-Class Struggle

The fundamental anarchist objection to tankism is that it subordinates
working-class self-organisation to the interests of states claiming
socialist legitimacy. When Soviet tanks crushed the Hungarian workers'
councils in 1956, they were destroying precisely the kind of horizontal,
directly democratic organisation that anarchists advocate. Those who
defended this repression placed loyalty to a state above solidarity with
workers.[^22]

As the anarchist publication *Freedom* has documented, tankies
consistently side with state power against popular movements. The same
pattern repeated in Czechoslovakia in 1968, Afghanistan in 1979, and
continues today with tankie support for the Assad regime in Syria and
the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[^23]

### False Anti-Imperialism

Anarchists argue that tankie "anti-imperialism" is not genuinely
anti-imperialist but merely pro-Russian or pro-Chinese imperialism. As
Roane Carey of *The Intercept* identified, "the key element in the
tankie mindset \[is\] the simple-minded assumption that only the United
States can be imperialist, and thus any country that opposes the U.S.
must be supported."[^24]

Lenin himself rejected this logic in 1916, writing: "Let us suppose that
a Japanese condemns the annexation of the Philippines by the Americans.
The question is: will many believe that he does so because he has a
horror of annexations as such, and not because he himself has a desire
to annex the Philippines?"[^25]

The USSR's support for African national liberation movements provides a
historical example. CLR James described a conversation with George
Padmore, who had joined the Communist Party and moved to the USSR in
1929 before leaving in 1934. Padmore explained that the party line had
changed: "in future we are going to be soft and not attack strongly the
democratic imperialists which are Britain, France and the United States.
That the main attack is to be directed upon the Fascist imperialists,
Italy, Germany and Japan." Padmore found this impossible—Germany and
Japan had no colonies in Africa, while Britain and France did. The USSR
supported African liberation only when it served Soviet geopolitical
interests.[^26]

Rustamova articulates the anarchist position clearly: "Hating the US
doesn't mean you've gotta love and believe the Russian state. What sort
of world must this be if we have to choose between the US/UK alliance,
and Russia/DPRK/China? Acknowledging and remembering the millions killed
by Soviet famine does not mean you can't also acknowledge and remember
that Britain forcibly starved three million to death in
Bangladesh."[^27]

### Genocide Denial and Historical Revisionism

A particularly troubling aspect of tankie ideology is its tendency
toward genocide denial and historical revisionism. Tankies routinely
dismiss well-documented Soviet atrocities—including the Ukrainian
Holodomor, the ethnic cleansing of Chechens, Crimean Tatars, and other
peoples, and the gulag system—as "Western propaganda".[^28]

Rustamova, whose family survived Soviet persecution, writes: "Mass rape
was planned and used by Soviet soldiers across Poland and East Germany
to punish ex-POWs. Jewish communities were wiped out across countless
nations. 2 million Afghans were killed in a Soviet genocide. 18 million
people were sent to gulags. 10 million deaths resulted from the 1932-3
deliberate, man-made famine. Ethnic genocides of Poles, Chechens,
Ingush, Balkars, Karachay, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks and so many
more."[^29]

From an anarchist perspective, this denial is particularly egregious
because it silences the voices of those who actually experienced Soviet
repression while privileging Western leftists who have no direct
knowledge of these events. As Rustamova observes: "People who grew up in
Soviet and post-Soviet nations are being silenced by Soviet apologist
Marxists who insist that 'Stalin Did Nothing Wrong'."[^30]

### Distinguishing Libertarian from Liberal Critique

Anarchists reject both tankie apologetics and liberal anti-communism. As
the libcom collective argues: "There is a tendency by everyone from
conservatives, to liberals, to social democrats to criticise the 'crimes
of communism' and ignore the actions of capitalist countries. This is
complete shite and we reject it completely."[^31]

The libertarian communist critique differs fundamentally from liberal
criticism: "Liberal myopia sees a horseshoe where liberal democracy is
'reasonable' and fascism and communism are two poles of
'authoritarianism'. A libertarian communist critique asserts that
communism is impossible within the framework of the nation state, and
that all states, whether fascist, liberal democratic or socialist will
suppress workers self-organisation in the interest of capital."[^32]

### Reproduction of Imperial Logic

A sophisticated anarchist critique argues that tankie ideology, despite
its anti-Western rhetoric, actually reproduces the imperial logic it
claims to oppose. By reducing all global politics to a binary of "US vs.
everyone else", tankies adopt the same Cold War framework that American
imperialists used. As one analyst noted, "American tankies project US
race relations as if that itself is a form of geopolitical analysis.
This is classical discursive colonialism."[^33]

This critique draws on Edward Said's analysis of Orientalism to argue
that tankies, by idealising foreign authoritarian states as perfect
socialist alternatives, actually erase the complexity and agency of
people in those countries. The tankie's idealised "Soviet Union" or
"People's Republic of China" exists only in their imagination,
disconnected from the actual experiences of workers and oppressed
peoples in those societies.[^34]

## Contemporary Manifestations

### Online Communities

The term "tankie" has experienced a resurgence in online left-wing
spaces since the mid-2010s. By 2017, it had re-emerged as pejorative
internet slang for supporters of authoritarian socialism, becoming
particularly popular among young democratic socialists.[^35]

Research mapping ideological subreddits found that tankie communities
position themselves further to the left than subreddits like
r/communism, r/socialism, and r/Anarchism, "underscoring their unique
placement on the periphery of the far-left cluster, emphasising their
extreme nature." The user base of tankies "tend to stick closely
together, more so than other far-left communities."[^36]

### Migration to Alternative Platforms

When tankie subreddits like r/GenZedong and r/GenZhou faced restrictions
on Reddit, they migrated to Lemmygrad.ml, a Marxist-Leninist online
platform. Research found that "tankies' move not only made them dominant
voices on Lemmygrad.ml but also seemed to amplify the overall toxic tone
on the platform."[^37] This mirrors patterns observed when far-right
groups were deplatformed and migrated to alternative platforms like
Parler and Gab.

### Toxicity and Pejorative Language

Tankies frequently use derogatory nicknames for other political
tendencies, such as "anarkiddies" for anarchists, "succdems" for social
democrats, and "westoids" or "libshits" for liberals. Research found
that "much like how right-wing extremists use terms like 'RINO'
(Republican in Name Only) to dismiss mainstream conservatives, this is
further evidence that tankies are on the periphery of the far-left,
mirroring other extremist strategies."[^38]

Toxicity analysis indicated that tankies are more likely than other
far-left groups to post antisemitic content.[^39]

## Working With Marxist-Leninists

Anarchists have debated how to relate to individual Marxist-Leninists in
practical organising contexts. As one anarchist perspective argues: "If
you're organising at work or around housing issues, the people you work
with are not going to all have the same politics at you, and your
opinions on the July 1918 uprising of Left Socialist Revolutionaries
after their expulsion from the Bolshevik government are not relevant to
that situation. Yes, really, no-one gives a shit. You're relating to
each other as workers in that situation, not as representatives of a
political niche."[^40]

However, cooperation with individuals differs from organisational
coalitions or "left-unity" projects. Questions to consider include
whether groups will try to divert protests into ineffectual rallies,
cooperate with police against more militant protesters, or whether
coworkers have links with union hierarchies or management. If there are
real political and organisational disagreements, it is better to be open
about them than gloss over them, and retain some independence.[^41]

## Anarchist Response

Anarchists maintain that criticism of the USSR and other authoritarian
"socialist" states is not anti-communist but rather essential to genuine
communist politics. As Mike Harman argues: "While there were famines and
bread riots in the USSR in the 1930s, British policy caused the Bengal
famine killing 3 million people in 1943. While the USSR and China have
imprisoned political dissidents, including many communists and
anarchists, the USA has the highest incarceration rate in the world...
Liberal myopia sees a horseshoe where liberal democracy is 'reasonable'
and fascism and communism are two poles of 'authoritarianism'. A
libertarian communist critique asserts that communism is impossible
within the framework of the nation state, and that all states, whether
fascist, liberal democratic or socialist will suppress workers
self-organisation in the interest of capital."[^42]

The anarchist position is that genuine anti-imperialism requires
opposing all imperialisms—American, Russian, Chinese, and others—and
supporting working-class movements regardless of which state they
challenge. This means solidarity with Iranian workers striking against
their government, with Syrian revolutionaries opposing Assad, with Hong
Kong protesters, and with Ukrainian resistance to Russian invasion,
while simultaneously opposing US intervention everywhere.[^43]

As Rustamova concludes: "We don't have a choice. Stalin Did Some Things
Wrong. Stalin's state was dramatically racist, sexist, and destructive
and the effects of his failures are still ringing out through the
Eastern Bloc. Ignoring, denying, or re-writing What Went Wrong only
undermines socialist and communist movements today."[^44]
