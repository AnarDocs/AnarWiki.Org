# Community Self-Defense

## Overview

**Community self-defense** is the collective practice of communities
protecting themselves from threats without relying on state institutions
like police or military forces. From an anarchist perspective, it
represents a fundamental departure from statist models of "law and
order" by emphasizing mutual aid, solidarity, voluntary cooperation, and
horizontal organization. Rather than being a specialized function
performed by a separate armed body, community self-defense is understood
as an integrated aspect of community life alongside other forms of
mutual support.

Community self-defense encompasses both physical protection against
immediate threats (fascist violence, police brutality, displacement) and
the defense of social values, autonomy, and ways of life that enable
human flourishing. It operates on the principle that communities can and
should determine their own security needs and responses without
depending on hierarchical authorities that historically have served to
protect property and power rather than people.

Community self-defense differs fundamentally from both police and mob
violence. Unlike police, it operates horizontally, remains directly
accountable to communities, and functions defensively rather than as
enforcement. Unlike mobs, it is deliberately organized through consensus
processes, operates by agreed-upon principles, and aims for protection
rather than punishment. It represents organized collective defense that
remains accountable and integrated with mutual aid.

## Origins

The practice of community self-defense predates the
<a href="State" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> itself, as
human communities have always organized collectively for protection.
However, the modern anarchist theorization of community self-defense
emerged from several historical developments and movements.

### Early Anarchist Practice

The <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> developed "flying squads" in the early 20th century - rapid
response teams that could be mobilized through phone lists to support
strikes, defend picket lines, and protect workers from employer violence
and strikebreaking.[^1][^2] This model demonstrated how pre-existing
relationships of trust and solidarity could enable effective collective
defense without permanent hierarchical command structures.

Anarchist communities in the
<a href="Spanish_Revolution_(1936-1939)" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> organized neighborhood
defense committees alongside other revolutionary institutions,
integrating defense functions with other aspects of communal
self-management.

### Civil Rights and Black Liberation

The <a href="Black_Panther_Party" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>, while not
explicitly anarchist, developed community self-defense models that
heavily influenced anarchist thinking. Their armed patrols monitoring
police, combined with survival programs like free breakfast programs and
health clinics, demonstrated that community defense involves both
immediate physical protection and building alternative institutions that
address root causes of violence and vulnerability.[^3][^4]

The <a href="Deacons_for_Defense_and_Justice" class="wikilink"
title="Deacons for Defense and Justice">Deacons for Defense and
Justice</a> and other Black self-defense organizations in the US South
during the 1960s showed how oppressed communities could organize
protection against white supremacist violence, challenging both the
<a href="Racism" class="wikilink" title="racist">racist</a> state and
terrorist groups.[^5][^6]

### Anti-Fascist Movements

The **Black Bloc** tactic originated in Germany during the 1980s as a
means of protecting squats and demonstrations from fascist and police
attacks.[^7][^8] Participants would dress in black clothing and masks to
create anonymity and collective identity while providing defense against
right-wing violence.

<a href="Anti-Racist_Action" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Racist Action">Anti-Racist Action</a> (ARA) emerged in
Minneapolis and spread across North America, organizing militant
opposition to fascist and white supremacist organizing.[^9][^10] Though
often reactive and spontaneous rather than formally trained, ARA
demonstrated working-class communities' capacity to deny fascists public
space through direct confrontation.

### Contemporary Developments

The Kurdish liberation movement in Rojava has developed perhaps the most
comprehensive contemporary model of community self-defense within a
broader framework of <a href="Democratic_Confederalism" class="wikilink"
title="Democratic Confederalism">Democratic Confederalism</a>. Their
system integrates self-defense forces with communes, councils,
cooperatives, and academies, while explicitly rotating armed tasks and
maintaining civilian control.

Various anarchist and autonomous movements have developed Copwatch
programs - organized surveillance of police actions to document and
publicize state violence, representing defense through documentation and
community awareness.

## Principles

Community self-defense operates according to anarchist principles that
fundamentally distinguish it from police and military institutions:

### Mutual Aid and Solidarity

Self-defense is understood as an expression of
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a> -
the basic anarchist organizing principle of voluntary cooperation for
common benefit. Communities defend each other because attacks on any
community member are understood as attacks on the collective. This
represents a radical departure from individualistic notions of
self-defense as protecting personal property, instead rooting defense in
social relationships and shared liberation.

The principle of
<a href="Solidarity" class="wikilink" title="solidarity">solidarity</a>
extends this to recognize that oppressions are interconnected. White
workers defending Black community members from racist violence, men
organizing against patriarchal violence, or temporarily-abled people
supporting disabled community members all express this solidarity
principle.

### Non-Hierarchy and Accountability

Unlike police forces that operate in strict hierarchies with minimal
accountability to communities they patrol, anarchist community
self-defense emphasizes horizontal organization and direct
accountability. Those engaged in defense roles hold the same power as
others performing different community functions. Decisions about when
and how to respond to threats come from community assemblies and
councils, not command structures.

Defense roles should be temporary and rotated among willing community
members, preventing the formation of a specialized warrior caste or
permanent armed body that could accumulate power. This is analogous to a
volunteer fire department model rather than a standing military.

### Defensive, Not Enforcement

Community self-defense is explicitly defensive rather than offensive or
enforcement-oriented. It responds to actual threats and attacks rather
than proactively enforcing rules or laws. There is no equivalent to
police "preventive patrol" or surveillance of community members.

Arms or force are understood as last resorts, only appropriate after
other forms of conflict resolution have been exhausted. The goal is
protection and de-escalation, not punishment or domination.

### Integration with Community Life

Self-defense is not treated as a separate specialized function but as
one integrated aspect of community autonomy alongside food production,
healthcare, education, childcare, and other mutual support activities.
Those performing defense tasks at any given moment are valued equally
with those performing other necessary community functions.

The "armed component should never become the center" as scott crow
articulates[^11] - carrying arms should be seen as a privileged task
with the same importance as childcare, growing food, or taking out
garbage, not as superior or more valuable.

### Dual Power and Prefiguration

Community self-defense is most effective when part of a broader
<a href="Dual_Power" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>
framework - simultaneously resisting exploitation and oppression while
building alternative institutions. Simply defending against immediate
threats without creating new forms of community autonomy risks becoming
permanent military structures.

Defense practices should prefigure the society being built,
incorporating liberatory ethics including challenges to
<a href="Patriarchy" class="wikilink"
title="patriarchal">patriarchal</a> gun culture,
<a href="Racism" class="wikilink" title="racial">racial</a> hierarchies,
<a href="Ableism" class="wikilink" title="ableist">ableist</a>
assumptions, and
<a href="Capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalist">capitalist</a>
values.

### Consciousness and Education

Effective self-defense requires consciousness - awareness of oneself,
one's community, and the systems of oppression. As the Komun Academy
articulates, "consciousness consists of a person's self-realization
based on values of societal freedom, as well as their action and
struggle for these values." Without understanding why defense is
necessary and what is being defended, communities cannot effectively
protect themselves.

All defense training includes education on liberatory ethics, mutual aid
principles, and analysis of power structures. This distinguishes it from
authoritarian military training focused solely on technique and
obedience.

## Forms of Community Self-Defense

Community self-defense takes many forms beyond armed confrontation:

### Physical Defense

- **Armed defense** - Temporarily taking up firearms or other weapons
  for defense against fascist violence, displacement, or state
  repression. Historical examples include the Black Panthers' armed
  patrols, the American Indian Movement's stand at Wounded Knee, and
  Rojava's People's Protection Units.

<!-- -->

- **Black Bloc tactics** - Anonymous collective action at demonstrations
  to provide defense against police and fascist violence while
  preventing individual targeting and arrest.

<!-- -->

- **Street-level confrontation** - Direct confrontation with fascists,
  white supremacists, and other organized reactionary forces to deny
  them public space and disrupt their organizing. Anti-Racist Action
  groups specialized in this approach.

<!-- -->

- **Flying squads** - Rapid-response teams that can be quickly mobilized
  to support strikes, defend communities under attack, or respond to
  emergencies. Based on IWW labor organizing models.

### Monitoring and Documentation

- **Copwatch** - Organized observation and documentation of police
  actions to protect community members from police violence through
  visibility and accountability. Groups record interactions, publicize
  abuses, and sometimes intervene to protect people from illegal police
  actions.

<!-- -->

- **Community patrols** - Neighborhood watch-style patrols by community
  members (not police) to provide security through presence and
  intervention when needed.

### Structural Defense

- **Survival programs** - Programs providing material support that
  address root causes of vulnerability and violence. The Black Panthers'
  free breakfast programs, health clinics, and schools represented
  community defense by reducing dependence on state institutions and
  building community power.

<!-- -->

- **Harm reduction** - Programs reducing harms from drug use, poverty,
  and state violence, keeping people alive and reducing vulnerabilities
  that make communities targets for exploitation.

<!-- -->

- **Survivor support** - Supporting survivors of sexual assault and
  domestic violence without subjecting them to revictimization by police
  and courts, while achieving accountability through community
  processes.

<!-- -->

- **Strike defense and picket training** - Training workers to maintain
  effective picket lines while reducing violence directed against them
  by police and strikebreakers.

### Education and Consciousness-Building

- **Political education** - Teaching anarchist theory, analyzing systems
  of oppression, and building consciousness about why defense is
  necessary. Includes education on histories of resistance and community
  self-defense.

<!-- -->

- **Martial arts and firearms training** - Physical skills training that
  includes liberatory ethics, power-sharing practices, and challenges to
  dominant gun culture and martial arts hierarchies.

<!-- -->

- **De-escalation training** - Skills for resolving conflicts without
  violence, preventing situations from requiring armed intervention.

### Building Alternative Institutions

Creating <a href="Cooperative" class="wikilink"
title="cooperatives">cooperatives</a>, free schools, health clinics,
community kitchens, and other institutions that meet needs outside state
and capitalist systems reduces community vulnerability and builds the
foundation for comprehensive autonomy that enables effective defense.

## Current Examples

### Rojava

The Kurdish autonomous region in northern Syria has developed perhaps
the most comprehensive contemporary implementation of anarchist
community self-defense principles, though within the framework of
<a href="Democratic_Confederalism" class="wikilink"
title="Democratic Confederalism">Democratic Confederalism</a> rather
than explicit anarchism. Their system includes:

- People's Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) organized with gender parity and
  rotation of armed tasks
- Integration of defense forces with communal councils that maintain
  civilian democratic control
- Self-defense understood as protecting both physical territory and
  social values including women's liberation
- Defense training combined with political education at various
  academies
- Defense forces as temporary rather than permanent professional
  military

### Copwatch Programs

Numerous cities have Copwatch organizations that train community members
to observe and document police interactions. Some notable examples
include Berkeley Copwatch, Portland Copwatch, and various programs in
Black and immigrant communities. These programs have documented patterns
of abuse, provided evidence for legal cases, and in some instances
directly intervened to prevent police violence.

### Anti-Fascist Networks

Contemporary <a href="Anti-Fascism" class="wikilink"
title="antifascist">antifascist</a> organizing continues traditions of
physical confrontation with fascist organizing, but increasingly
combines this with community education, doxxing fascist organizers,
pressuring venues to cancel fascist events, and building networks for
rapid response to fascist mobilizations.

### Neighborhood Defense Initiatives

Various neighborhoods, particularly those abandoned by state services or
actively targeted by police, have organized informal defense networks
including:

- Community patrols in immigrant neighborhoods to protect against ICE
  raids
- Indigenous communities protecting land from resource extraction
- Homeless encampments organizing against police sweeps
- Neighborhood watch programs in communities of color that operate
  independently of police

### Labor Defense

Some <a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="IWW">IWW</a> branches and other radical unions maintain flying
squad models for rapid response to support strikes and defend picket
lines. Picket line defense training has been revived in some places to
prepare workers for confrontations with police and strikebreakers.

## In an Anarchist Society

In a fully developed anarchist society, community self-defense would be
integrated into broader structures of communal self-management:

### Organizational Structure

Defense functions would be coordinated through the same
<a href="Workers&#39;_Council" class="wikilink"
title="councils">councils</a>, assemblies, and federations that handle
other aspects of social life. Local neighborhood or workplace assemblies
would make decisions about security needs and responses, with
coordination happening through regional councils and voluntary
federations as needed.

Analogous to volunteer fire departments, communities would maintain
rosters of people trained in various defense capacities who could be
called upon when needed. All able members would receive basic training
in self-defense, conflict resolution, and emergency response, but
defense would not be anyone's permanent full-time role.

### Prevention Through Solidarity

A functioning anarchist society would dramatically reduce need for
physical defense by addressing root causes of violence and conflict:

- Economic equality and guaranteed material security would eliminate
  desperation-driven crime
- Restorative justice processes would address harms without punishment
- Strong networks of mutual aid would prevent social isolation that
  enables abuse
- Democratic decision-making would provide non-violent means for
  resolving disputes
- Education in consent, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution
  from early age would reduce interpersonal violence

### Defensive Capacity

When defense is necessary, anarchist societies would maintain several
capacities:

- **Rapid response teams** could mobilize quickly for emergencies, with
  training in de-escalation, emergency medical response, and if
  necessary armed defense
- **Border defense** against external threats from
  <a href="State" class="wikilink" title="states">states</a> or other
  hierarchical forces would be organized through voluntary militias with
  rotation of duty and democratic control
- **Anti-fascist vigilance** to prevent reorganization of authoritarian
  movements
- **Environmental defense** protecting ecosystems and communities from
  extractive industries or other threats

### Challenging Toxic Defense Cultures

Anarchist community defense would actively work against patriarchal
warrior culture, gun fetishism, machismo, and militarism. This would
include:

- Rotating armed tasks among people of all genders
- Valuing emotional intelligence and care work equally with combat
  skills
- Refusing to glorify violence while recognizing its sometimes-necessity
- Maintaining that those performing defense roles hold no special status
- Integrating defense training with political education and ethics
- Ensuring disabled people, elders, and others can participate in
  defense in appropriate capacities

### Continual Demilitarization

Anarchist societies would maintain constant vigilance against the armed
component becoming permanent or central. This requires:

- Regular rotation of defense roles back into other community functions
- Democratic oversight and ability to instantly recall any defense
  coordination roles
- Keeping weapons stored collectively rather than individually
- Prioritizing non-violent conflict resolution and only taking up arms
  when necessary
- Evaluating whether defensive measures are actually increasing security
  or creating new problems

## Criticism

Community self-defense faces several criticisms and challenges:

### Risk of Militarization

Critics worry that any armed component risks becoming permanent military
hierarchies. Historical examples show defensive forces sometimes
evolving into armies that seize permanent power. The challenge is
maintaining liberatory principles and temporary status while developing
sufficient capacity to actually defend communities.

### Adequacy Question

Skeptics question whether voluntary community defense can adequately
protect against well-armed state forces or organized fascist violence.
Anarchists acknowledge this limitation while arguing that current
dependence on state security has proven far more dangerous to oppressed
communities than imperfect autonomous defense.

### Romanticization of Violence

Some activists romanticize armed struggle or confrontational tactics,
potentially centering violence rather than treating it as last resort.
This risks replicating authoritarian military culture and alienating
broader communities.

### Training and Capacity

Developing genuine defensive capacity requires significant training and
resources. Many anarchist communities currently have minimal
self-defense capabilities, making discussions of community defense
partially aspirational rather than immediate reality.

### Coordination Without Hierarchy

Effective defense sometimes requires quick coordinated action, creating
tension with horizontal decision-making processes. Finding ways to
enable rapid response while maintaining democratic accountability
remains an ongoing challenge.

### Accountability and Abuse

Without external oversight, how do communities ensure those performing
defense roles don't abuse that position? Anarchist approaches emphasize
collective accountability, rotation, and community control, but
implementation remains challenging, particularly in responding to
gender-based violence within movements.

## Distinguishing Community Self-Defense from Policing and Mob Justice

Community self-defense is frequently conflated with either police forces
or vigilante mob justice, but it differs fundamentally from both in
structure, purpose, and practice.

### Not Policing

Community self-defense represents a categorical rejection of the police
model rather than a community-based version of it. The differences are
structural and irreconcilable:

**Accountability and Power**

Police operate with qualified immunity and legal protections that shield
them from consequences for violence. They can kill, brutalize, and
violate rights with minimal accountability to those they police.
Community self-defense operates on direct accountability - those
performing defense roles remain subject to the same community processes
as everyone else and can be immediately removed from those roles by
community decision. There is no separate legal status granting immunity.

**Purpose and Function**

Police exist fundamentally to protect
<a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="property relations">property relations</a> and maintain the
<a href="State" class="wikilink" title="state&#39;s">state's</a>
monopoly on violence. Their role is enforcing laws created by ruling
classes, not protecting community safety. Studies consistently show
police do not prevent violence but respond after the fact, often
escalating situations.[^12] Community self-defense exists to protect
people and communal autonomy, not property or state power.

**Relationship to Community**

Police are an external occupying force, particularly in oppressed
communities. They do not live in the neighborhoods they patrol, are not
accountable to those communities, and often view residents as potential
threats. Community self-defense consists of community members defending
themselves and each other based on relationships of trust and
solidarity.

**Organizational Structure**

Police operate in rigid hierarchies with command structures, ranks, and
permanent specialized roles. Community self-defense emphasizes
horizontal organization, rotation of tasks, and temporary assumption of
defense roles. No one becomes permanently "the defender" with special
status.

**Proactive vs. Defensive**

Police engage in "preventive" patrol, surveillance, and enforcement -
proactively controlling and monitoring populations. Community
self-defense is explicitly defensive, responding to actual threats
rather than policing everyday community life. There is no equivalent to
stop-and-frisk, broken windows policing, or surveillance of community
members.

**Use of Force**

Police are trained to escalate force and maintain dominance through
violence. Community self-defense treats force as an absolute last resort
after exhausting other options, emphasizing de-escalation and conflict
resolution. The goal is protection and restored community safety, not
domination or punishment.

**Permanence and Militarization**

Police forces are permanent standing institutions that accumulate
weapons, military equipment, and institutional power. Community
self-defense explicitly resists permanence and militarization through
rotation, democratic control, and maintaining that armed components
should never become central to community life.

### Not Mob Justice

Community self-defense must also be distinguished from spontaneous mob
violence or vigilantism, which shares police forces' lack of
accountability while adding chaotic organization:

**Organization vs. Spontaneity**

Mobs are spontaneous, unplanned eruptions of collective violence without
agreed-upon processes or structures. Community self-defense is
deliberately organized through democratic assemblies, established
protocols, and collective decision-making. Actions are planned,
discussed, and agreed upon rather than impulsive reactions.

**Collective Accountability vs. Anonymized Chaos**

Mob violence depends on anonymity and diffusion of responsibility - no
one feels personally accountable because everyone participated.
Community self-defense requires clear collective accountability.
Decisions and actions are discussed openly in community assemblies, with
individuals taking responsibility for their roles while being supported
by collective agreement.

**Process and Deliberation**

Mobs bypass deliberative processes, acting on immediate emotional
reactions without consideration of context, evidence, or
proportionality. Community self-defense emphasizes careful evaluation of
situations, community discussion of appropriate responses, and adherence
to agreed-upon principles even in urgent situations. Even rapid-response
actions operate within frameworks established through prior collective
discussion.

**Restorative vs. Punitive Goals**

Mob justice typically seeks revenge, punishment, or destruction of those
deemed threatening. Community self-defense aims for protection,
de-escalation, and ultimately restoration of community harmony. The goal
is not to punish but to end immediate threats and address root causes of
violence and conflict.

**Liberatory Ethics vs. Reactionary Violence**

Mobs often enforce reactionary social norms, targeting marginalized
people, enforcing <a href="Patriarchy" class="wikilink"
title="patriarchal">patriarchal</a> or
<a href="Racism" class="wikilink" title="racial">racial</a> hierarchies,
or protecting <a href="Private_Property" class="wikilink"
title="property">property</a> interests. Community self-defense is
grounded in explicit liberatory ethics - challenging all forms of
domination, protecting the most vulnerable, and refusing to replicate
oppressive power dynamics.

**Sustainability and Community Building**

Mob violence is a temporary eruption that does not build ongoing
community capacity. Community self-defense is sustained practice
integrated with other forms of
<a href="Mutual_Aid" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
and community building. It develops skills, relationships, and capacity
that strengthen communities beyond immediate defensive actions.

**Democratic Control vs. Charismatic Leadership**

Mobs frequently form around charismatic individuals who direct
collective violence without accountability. Community self-defense
operates through democratic structures where no individual holds command
authority and decisions come from collective deliberation in assemblies
and councils.

### The Third Alternative

Community self-defense offers a genuine alternative to both the
authoritarian violence of policing and the chaotic violence of mob
justice. It combines the organizational capacity to effectively respond
to threats with the democratic accountability to prevent abuse of that
capacity. Neither police nor mobs are accountable to the communities
they affect. Both can and do perpetrate violence against vulnerable
people. Both lack the deliberative processes necessary for justice.

By rooting defense in horizontal organization, mutual aid principles,
temporary rotation of roles, and integration with broader community
autonomy, anarchist community self-defense avoids the pitfalls of both
models. It demonstrates that communities can protect themselves
effectively without creating permanent armed hierarchies or descending
into unaccountable violence.

This distinction is not merely semantic but represents fundamentally
different relationships to power, violence, and community. The challenge
is not simply replacing who holds the guns, but transforming the entire
relationship between defense, community, and autonomy.
