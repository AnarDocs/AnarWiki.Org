The Pequots are an indigenous people in southern “New England” that
historically lived without a state and made many decisions by a
consensus process. In the 1639 Pequot War, English settlers killed at
least two-thirds of Pequots. Today in “Connecticut” there are two Pequot
tribes, the federally-recognized Mashantucket Pequots and
state-recognized Paucatuck Pequots.

# Decisions

In traditional Pequot society, positions of power rested on their
village's' consensual support. Sachems, for example, would feel a need
to frequently give gifts and perform favors in order to maintain support
from constituents. “Power and authority relationships are reciprocal
agreements,” explains the anthropologist William Starna.[^1]

The sachem, usually a man but on occasion a woman, was a hereditary
position of day-to-day community leadership. The sachem had a council
that participated in major decisions such as war and peace. Members of
this council were called pnieses. The powwow, or shaman, held influence
on spiritual matters.[^2]

Decision-making between these officials, all of whom needed support from
the village, followed a consensus process, as Starna outlines:

> Decision making and the operation of government was based on
> consensus. Each sachem received counsel from other high-status
> individuals, including the pnieses and pow-wows. In addition,
> influential or other well-regarded warriors had input into the
> political process, along with members of the community, such as elders
> and other respected persons, who formed councils or caucuses. At all
> of those levels, reciprocity drove the process. The outcome was a
> village-oriented, autonomous, consensual government.[^3]

# Economy

Pequots lived in small villages of ten to twenty households. Dwellings
included the wigwam and the longhouse. The villages were sedentary but
changed location by season. Pequots practiced a combination of
horticulture, hunting, gathering, and fishing. They would grow crops
such as corn, beans, squash, and artichoke, hunt game such as deer, bear
and raccoon, and gather fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, and
blackberries. Women performed most of the planting, cultivating,
harvesting, and gathering, while men performed most of the hunting and
grew the tobacco.[^4]

# Environment

While Indians of southern “New England” altered the environment
considerably, their alterations may have actually improved biodiversity.
Indians would burn down parts of forests to create fields for farming,
and they would reuse these fields for eight to ten years. While European
settlers of the region planted monoculture farms, Indians planted
densely-entangled corn, bean and squash, which preserved the soil
moisture, discouraged weeds, yielded more food than the settlers' farms
did. The region's Indians also set fires to large areas of forest in
order to clear underbrush. This burning tended to destroy plant diseases
and pest, and it created large areas resembling the boundary between
forests and grasslands, ideal habitat for the elk, deer, beaver,
porcupine, turkey, quail and these animals' predators: the wolf, fox,
eagle, hawk, and lynx. “Indians created ideal habitats for a host of
wildlife species,” summarizes the historian William Cronon in *Changes
in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England*.[^5]

# Neighboring Societies

Autonomous villages would band together to form “multivillage alliances”
in order to negotiate with European settlers.[^6] The Pequots exacted
tribute from other Indian nations.[^7]

## 1637-8 Pequot War

In 1634, Dutch traders captured Tatobem, a Pequot sachem and killed him
even though Pequots paid the traders the requested ransom money. In
retaliation, Pequots attacked a Dutch trading post in what is now
“Hartford”.[^8] Soon afterwards, the Virginian trader John Stone
kidnapped and killed some Native Americans, and the natives responded by
killing Stone.[^9] The Pequots promised to hand over the killers, who
probably belonged to the Western Niantics, a tribe that paid tribute to
the Pequots. Then, in August 1636, Eastern Niantics and Narragansetts
sentenced to death the English trader John Oldham.[^10] The
Narragansetts likely believed that Oldham had deliberately infected them
with smallpox.[^11]

The English decided to retaliate against the Pequots even though the
Pequots were not responsible for the deaths of Stone or Oldham. In fact,
Captain John Mason later admitted that there was intent to destroy the
Pequot people: “We had formerly concluded to destroy them by the Sword
and save the Plunder.”[^12] That month, an English expedition led by
John Endicott sacked Pequot villages and the English, meanwhile, formed
an alliance with Naragansetts, Mohegans and some dissident Pequots. In
April 1637, Pequots attacked English settlers in “Wethersfield,” killing
nine settlers including three women, and taking two girls prisoner. The
English used this attack as an excuse to launch a war to exterminate the
Pequots.[^13]

On 26 May 1637, English soldiers led by Captains John Mason and John
Underhill, along with Indian allies, attacked a Pequot village in
“Mystic” while most of the Pequot men were away. The English and allies
surrounded the village, burned down the wigwams, and shot those who
fled. Captain Underhill later wrote about the massacre:

> Many were burnt in the fort, both men, women, and children. Others
> forced out...which our soldiers received and entertained with the
> point of the sword. Down fell men, women, and children... Sometimes
> the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their
> parents. Sometimes the case alters; but we will not dispute it now. We
> had sufficient light from the word of God for our proceedings.[^14]

By Captain Mason's count, the attack killed six or seven hundred
Pequots. Only two English settlers died. During the massacre,
Naragansett warriors yelled the English to stop the dishonorable
killing. Mason described the carnage and, like Underhill, rationalized
it as a just, Christian religious war:

> And indeed such a dreadful Terror did the Almighty let fall upon their
> Spirits, that they would fly from us and run into the very Flames,
> where many of them perished. . . . \[And\] God was above them, who
> laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to Scorn, making
> them as a fiery Oven: Thus were the Stout Hearted spoiled, having
> slept their last Sleep, and none of their Men could find their Hands:
> Thus did the Lord judge among the Heathen, filling the Place with dead
> Bodies![^15]

The English then hunted down surviving Pequots into “into
near-extermination. Other villages were found and burned. Small groups
of warriors were intercepted and killed. Pockets of starving women and
children were located, captured, and sold into slavery. If they were
fortunate. Others were bound hand and foot and thrown into the ocean
just beyond the harbor. And still more were buried where they were
found, such as one group of three hundred or so who tried to escape
through a swampland”.[^16] The war concluded in 1638 with the Treaty of
Hartford, in which Pequot sachems ceded Pequot sovereignty.[^17]

At least two-thirds of the Pequot population died during the war.
Captain Mason's account makes clear that the war was an act of
premeditated genocide: “We had formerly concluded to destroy them by the
Sword and save the plunder.”[^18]
