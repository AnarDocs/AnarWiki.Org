# V for Vendetta

*V for Vendetta* is a revolutionary British graphic novel written by
Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony
Weare). Initially published between 1982 and 1985 in black and white in
the British anthology *Warrior*, its serialization was completed in
1988–89 in a ten-issue color limited series published by DC Comics. The
story depicts a dystopian near-future history version of the United
Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a nuclear war in the 1980s that
devastated most of the rest of the world. The Nordic supremacist,[^1]
neo-fascist,[^2][^3] Norsefire political party has exterminated its
opponents in concentration camps and rules the country as a police
state.

The story follows its protagonist, V, an anarchist revolutionary dressed
in a Guy Fawkes mask, as he begins an elaborate revolutionary campaign
to kill his former captors, bring down the fascist state, and inspire
people to embrace anarchism. Throughout his journey, V mentors a young
woman, Evey Hammond, to continue his legacy. Central to the narrative is
V's dual approach to anarchism: destruction of the oppressive state
apparatus followed by the creation of a new society based on voluntary
cooperation without rulers—as V explicitly states, "Anarchy means
'without leaders', not 'without order'."[^4]

The story that would become *V for Vendetta* began as a submission that
DC Thomson rejected in 1975: "The Doll," involving a transgender
terrorist in white face makeup who fought a totalitarian state during
the 1980s.

Years later, Dez Skinn invited Moore to create a dark mystery strip with
artist David Lloyd. They chose to set the story in the near future
rather than the recent past, avoiding the need for historical research.
David Lloyd developed the idea of dressing V as Guy Fawkes, a figure
already associated with anti-government action in British history,
moving away from the conventional superhero look.

During the preparation of the story, Moore made a list of influences:

"Orwell. Huxley. Thomas Disch. Judge Dredd. Harlan Ellison's 'Repent,
Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman, Catman and The Prowler in the City at
the Edge of the World by the same author. Vincent Price's Dr. Phibes and
Theatre of Blood. David Bowie. The Shadow. Night Raven. Batman.
Fahrenheit 451. The writings of the New Worlds school of science
fiction. Max Ernst's painting 'Europe After the Rain'. Thomas Pynchon.
The atmosphere of British Second World War films. The Prisoner. Robin
Hood. Dick Turpin..."[^5]

The political climate of Britain in the early 1980s heavily influenced
the work,[^6] with Moore positing that Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government would "obviously lose the 1983 elections," and that an
incoming Michael Foot-led Labour government, committed to complete
nuclear disarmament, would allow the United Kingdom to escape relatively
unscathed after a limited nuclear war. However, Moore felt that fascists
would quickly subvert a post-nuclear holocaust Britain.[^7] Moore
deliberately made V's actions "very, very morally ambiguous" with the
aim that "I didn't want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to
tell people to think."[^8]

## Plot

In a fascist Britain of 1997, after a nuclear war that has devastated
much of the world, the authoritarian Norsefire regime controls the
population through surveillance, police brutality, and concentration
camps. On Guy Fawkes Night, a masked anarchist known only as V rescues
Evey Hammond from members of the secret police. V then destroys the
Houses of Parliament as the first act in his campaign against the
government.

V brings Evey to his hidden lair, the "Shadow Gallery," filled with
prohibited cultural items he has rescued. We learn that the nuclear war
led to environmental devastation and famine, after which corporations
and fascist groups formed the totalitarian Norsefire government, led by
the reclusive Adam Susan who obsessively monitors the nation through the
Fate computer system.

V systematically targets key figures from the Larkhill Resettlement Camp
where he was imprisoned and subjected to cruel medical experiments. He
drives the camp's former commander, Lewis Prothero (now a propaganda
broadcaster), to madness. He then forces Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a
pedophile priest who worked at Larkhill, to consume a poisoned communion
wafer. Finally, he kills Dr. Delia Surridge, who had experimented on
prisoners, but grants her a painless death because she had shown
remorse. Through Surridge's diary, police detective Eric Finch discovers
that V was the only survivor of medical experiments at Larkhill,
experiments that gave him enhanced abilities but also drove him to
destroy the camp and escape.

V later broadcasts a message calling for the people to resist the
government and take personal responsibility for their lives. He also
manipulates events to destroy the government's surveillance and
propaganda networks. Meanwhile, Evey, who had left V and found shelter
with a man named Gordon, is captured after Gordon is killed. She is
imprisoned, tortured, and interrogated, but refuses to cooperate. She
finds a letter from another prisoner, Valerie, a lesbian actress who was
persecuted by the regime, which gives Evey strength. When Evey chooses
execution over compliance, she discovers that her imprisonment was an
elaborate ruse by V to free her from fear and societal conditioning.

On the following November 5th, V destroys the government's surveillance
headquarters and effectively cripples the regime's control systems. As
social order begins to collapse, V describes this period as the "Land of
Take-What-You-Want," an intermediate stage before reaching the "Land of
Do-As-You-Please"—his vision of a true anarchist society.

V is mortally wounded in a confrontation with Finch. Before dying, V
tells Evey that the future belongs to ordinary people, not to him or
other "heroes." Evey assumes V's identity, deciding not to unmask him
because she understands that V is more than a person—he is an idea. With
the government in chaos after its leaders kill each other in power
struggles, Evey (as V) addresses the people, destroying 10 Downing
Street and telling them they must "choose what comes next. Lives of your
own, or a return to chains," sparking an insurrection throughout London.

## Anarchist Themes

*V for Vendetta* explores anarchism as its central political philosophy,
presenting it not as chaos but as a society without rulers where order
emerges organically from free association. As Joshua Anol notes, "V's
definition of Anarchy is a society without any overlords, yet somehow
retains order in some shape or form."[^9]

V's anarchism manifests through various theoretical frameworks:

### The Dual Faces of Anarchy

V explicitly states that "Anarchy wears two faces, both Creator and
Destroyer. Thus Destroyers topple empires; make a canvas of clean rubble
where creators can then build a better world."[^10] This concept aligns
with Mikhail Bakunin's famous quote that "the passion for destruction is
a creative passion, too." V embodies the Destroyer aspect through his
systematic dismantling of Norsefire's power structures, while preparing
Evey to become the Creator who will guide society toward
self-organization without imposing new authority.

### Insurrectionary Anarchism

V's methods—direct action, property destruction, and targeted violence
against state representatives—reflect insurrectionary anarchist tactics.
Rather than seeking reform or working within existing political
structures, V believes the fascist state must be completely destroyed
before liberation can occur. His symbolic attacks against government
buildings and his killing of state officials who perpetrated atrocities
represent a form of propaganda by deed, a historical anarchist tactic
meant to inspire popular revolt.

### Social Anarchism

The "Land of Do-As-You-Please" that V envisions reflects principles of
social anarchism, where individuals cooperate voluntarily without
hierarchical control. V's Shadow Gallery itself represents a microcosm
of this vision—a space filled with forbidden culture, knowledge, and art
that has been rescued from state censorship, suggesting that genuine
human creativity and learning flourish in the absence of authoritarian
control.

### Individual Liberation

V's "education" of Evey—including the controversial simulation of her
imprisonment—demonstrates the anarchist concern with psychological
liberation from internalized authority. By forcing Evey to confront and
overcome her fear of the state, V helps her achieve genuine autonomy.
This reflects the anarchist principle that political revolution must be
accompanied by personal transformation.

### Critique of Fascism

The graphic novel presents fascism as the ultimate expression of state
power—a system that subordinates individual lives to the supposed good
of the nation, enforced through violence, surveillance, and propaganda.
Through V's rebellion, Moore suggests that the natural response to such
oppression is anarchist resistance that affirms human dignity and
self-determination.

The conflict between anarchism and fascism is central to the narrative,
with V representing the radical rejection of all forms of domination,
while Norsefire embodies the extreme manifestation of hierarchical
control and ethno-nationalism. Moore's nuanced portrayal avoids
simplistic moral judgments, instead inviting readers to consider both
the ethical complexities of revolutionary violence and the moral
bankruptcy of the fascist state.

## Adaptations

### Film

In December 2005, Warner Bros. released a feature-film adaptation of *V
for Vendetta*, directed by James McTeigue from a screenplay by the
Wachowskis, with Natalie Portman starring as Evey Hammond and Hugo
Weaving as V.

Alan Moore distanced himself from the film, as he has with other screen
adaptations of his works. He criticized the adaptation for transforming
his story into "a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a
political satire in their own country. ... It's a thwarted and
frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with
American liberal values standing up against a state run by
neoconservatives – which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about.
It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England."

From an anarchist perspective, the film significantly waters down the
political radicalism of the original work. While V retains his violent
methods in the film, his explicit anarchist philosophy is largely
removed, replaced with vague appeals to "freedom" and "justice" that fit
more comfortably within liberal democratic frameworks. The film's
ending, with a mass of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks witnessing the
destruction of Parliament, suggests a symbolic protest rather than the
beginning of an actual anarchist revolution as depicted in the graphic
novel.

### Television

*Pennyworth*, ostensibly a prequel to Fox series *Gotham*, was later
confirmed by series co-showrunner Danny Cannon to also serve as a loose
prequel to *V for Vendetta*, with the British Civil War depicted in the
series eventually leading to the formation of the Norsefire government
of *V for Vendetta*.

## Cultural Impact

</figure>

Perhaps the most profound impact of *V for Vendetta* has been the
adoption of the Guy Fawkes mask as a symbol of resistance by actual
anarchist and anti-authoritarian movements worldwide. Since the film
adaptation's release in 2005, hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks
have been sold annually, becoming a powerful symbol of
anti-establishment sentiment and popular resistance to perceived
tyranny.

The hacktivist collective Anonymous popularized the mask during their
2008 Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology. The
mask subsequently appeared at Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and
other protest movements globally. David Lloyd noted with approval: "The
Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard
to use in protest against tyranny—and I'm happy with people using it, it
seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way."

The mask has transcended its fictional origins to become a genuine
revolutionary symbol, appearing in protests during the Arab Spring, the
2011 Egyptian revolution, against British MPs' expenses, in the Occupy
movement, and in the Hong Kong protests of 2014 and 2019-2020. This
transformation of a literary anarchist icon into a real-world symbol of
resistance represents a remarkable crossing of the boundary between
fiction and political reality.

From an anarchist perspective, the irony has not been lost that Time
Warner owns the rights to the image and profits from each official mask
sold—a corporate co-option of anti-capitalist sentiment that highlights
the tensions between resistance and commodification in capitalist
society. Nevertheless, the mask's widespread adoption demonstrates how
*V for Vendetta* has succeeded in popularizing aspects of anarchist
symbolism and direct action tactics in contemporary political discourse.

The February 1999 issue of *The Comics Journal* ran a poll on "The Top
100 (English-Language) Comics of the Century": *V for Vendetta* reached
83rd place. On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed *V for Vendetta* on
its list of the 100 most influential novels.
