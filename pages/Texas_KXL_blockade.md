The Grassroots Battle Against Big Oi Activists in Texas are connecting
the fight against the Keystone pipeline with the struggle for
environmental justice.

By Wen Stephenson

One morning in mid-July, I drove north out of Houston at the crack of
dawn, three hours up Highway 59 into the cleaner air and dense, piney
woods of deep East Texas. It was Sunday, and I was on my way to church.
  I’d been up that way before: my father was born and raised in
northeast Texas—in fact, my whole family is from Texas—and I’m no
stranger to Bible Belt Christianity. But I’d never been to a church like
the one where I was headed that morning: the small, progressive Austin
Heights Baptist Church in Nacogdoches, which meets in an unassuming
building on the edge of town.

Austin Heights was formed as a breakaway congregation in the charged
atmosphere of 1968, when its founders could no longer accept the
dominant Southern Baptist line on issues of race and war, and it
established a lasting fellowship with the leading African-American
church in Nacogdoches, Zion Hill First Baptist. The first morning I was
there, the Rev. Kyle Childress, Austin Heights’ pastor since 1989 (and
the only white member of the local black ministers’ alliance), preached
on the Old Testament prophet Amos, who, he noted, was among the
favorites of Martin Luther King Jr. Childress began his sermon by
reminding us that this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
protests in Bull Connor’s Birmingham in the spring of 1963 and the March
on Washington later that summer, and that one of King’s most-used lines
(found, for example, in his 1963 “Letter From a Birmingham Jail” and “I
Have a Dream” speech) was a verse from that morning’s Scripture reading
in Amos: “Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an
ever-flowing stream.”

The prophet Amos, Childress told us, was called to be a fierce
advocate—among the Bible’s fiercest—on behalf of justice for the poor
and oppressed. “Amos’s strong preaching was hard then, and it’s hard
today,” Childress said. Just as in Amos’s day, when the wealthy trampled
on the poor while worshiping piously in the temples, so today our
“programs of care for the poor and needy” are dismantled “with a
religious zeal.” Meanwhile, “giant corporations get a free ride. They
can diminish people, destroy the earth, pour out climate-changing
carbon, all in the interest of short-term profit, and no one can do
anything about it.” But Amos knew, Childress assured us, that God is the
spring of justice—and that without God, “we are unable to keep up the
struggle for justice and goodness and love over the long haul.”
Overwhelmed

“God calls us to justice, to be a people who embody justice,” said
Childress, himself a longtime activist on issues of race, poverty and
peace. And yet, as King and all those who fought for civil rights knew,
“serving and battling for justice is a long-haul kind of calling.”

Childress—deeply influenced by the likes of Wendell Berry, the late Will
D. Campbell and, of course, King—is not a Bible-thumper. He doesn’t
shout. Heavyset and ruddy-faced, with a whitening, close-cropped beard,
he speaks with a soft, flat West Texas accent. But his voice carries
real power and conviction. I would have been impressed with his sermon
even if I didn’t know that his words that Sunday morning held a
heightened significance for his congregation—not just because of the
civil rights history, but because this little East Texas church, which
can count perhaps 100 souls in its pews on a typical Sunday, is involved
in a new battle. I wasn’t there just to hear the preaching.

In the past year, the Austin Heights congregation has found itself in
the thick of the intense fight over the Keystone XL pipeline,
specifically the southern leg of it—running from Cushing, Oklahoma,
through East Texas (within twenty miles of Nacogdoches) to Gulf Coast
refineries in Port Arthur and Houston—which was fast-tracked by
President Obama in March 2012 and is now nearing completion, according
to TransCanada, the Canadian corporation building it.

I’d reached out to Childress, and following the morning service I was
scheduled to meet and interview, there at the church, several members of
Tar Sands Blockade, the diverse group of mostly young, radical climate
and social-justice activists (many of them Occupy veterans) who one year
earlier had mounted a high-stakes, headline-grabbing campaign of
nonviolent direct action—including a dramatic, eighty-five-day aerial
tree blockade and numerous lockdowns at construction sites—to stop or
slow the pipeline’s construction in Texas. In the process, they’ve
worked with everyone from local environmentalists raising the alarm on
the dangers of tar sands leaks and spills (as seen in Kalamazoo,
Michigan, and Mayflower, Arkansas) to conservative landowners fighting
TransCanada’s use (and, they will tell you, abuse) of eminent domain.
Most of those who have engaged in and supported the direct action
campaign—a true grassroots uprising—have been Texans, young and old,
twentysomethings and grandparents.

Last fall, a number of the young blockaders, living at an encampment on
private property just outside Nacogdoches, started coming to church at
Austin Heights. And though they came from all sorts of cultural and
religious backgrounds, and often had no religion at all, they formed a
close bond with many members of the mostly white, middle-class
congregation—who welcomed them into their homes like family—and had been
working with the local grassroots anti-pipeline group Nacogdoches STOP
(Stop Tar-Sands Oil Permanently), co-founded by members of Austin
Heights.

Since the blockaders began showing up at his church, Childress told me
as we drank coffee on his back porch the next morning, people have
noticed a change in his preaching. “There’s an urgency that maybe I
didn’t have before. They’re reminding us that climate change is not
something we’re going to fiddle-faddle around with. I mean, you’ve got
to step up now.”

But there’s more to it, Childress continued: “I’m preaching to young
people who are putting their lives on the line. They didn’t come down
here driving a Mercedes Benz, sitting around under a shade tree eating
grapes. They hitchhiked. They rode buses. And they get arrested, they
get pepper-sprayed, they get some stiff penalties thrown against them.”
(In January, Tar Sands Blockade and allied groups settled a lawsuit
brought by TransCanada seeking \$5 million in damages for construction
delays, forcing them to stay off the pipeline easement and any
TransCanada property.)

Childress noted that some of the blockaders, especially the Occupy
veterans, refer to the corporate capitalist system as “the Machine.”
“And they’re exactly right, using that kind of language,” he said.
“They’re going up against the Machine in a real, clearly defined way.
Not subtle—really upfront. And I’m trying to help them realize what it’s
going to take to sustain the struggle.”

When it exploded onto the scene last summer and fall, Tar Sands Blockade
galvanized a climate movement that was ready for escalated direct action
to stop the Keystone XL and build resistance to extreme fossil fuel
extraction: everything from the exploitation of tar sands, to shale oil
and gas fracking, to mountaintop-removal coal mining. As several climate
organizers engaged at the national level have told me, the East Texas
blockade showed the movement what it looks like to stand up and fight
against seemingly insurmountable odds. Now, a full year since it
launched, and with the southern leg of the pipeline all but in the
ground, I wanted to find out how—and even if—Tar Sands Blockade would go
forward.

In some ways, the challenges it faces reflect those facing the climate
movement writ large. There’s a tension, which many in the movement feel,
between the sheer urgency of climate action—the kind of urgency that
leads one to blockade a pipeline—and the slower, more patient work
required for organizing and movement building over the long haul. I
wanted to know what it will take for Tar Sands Blockade to sustain its
struggle—not only what it took to get into the fight, in such dramatic
fashion, but what it takes to stay in the fight.

That first Sunday at Austin Heights, I talked for several hours with
four blockaders who were still living at the camp outside town. All of
them had been arrested while participating in various direct actions on
the southern pipeline route. One of them, a young woman in her early 20s
who asked not to be identified, was an Occupy veteran who’d engaged in a
high-risk tree-sit on the pipeline easement and whose legal case was
still unresolved. Another, a recent MIT grad named Murtaza Nek, whose
family is Pakistani-American and whose Muslim faith is central to his
climate-justice activism, told me he finds a lot of common ground with
Childress and the Austin Heights congregation. He was arrested while
serving as support for an action near Diboll, south of Nacogdoches.

A third blockader, 42-year-old Fitzgerald Scott, also an Occupy veteran
(Tampa, DC, Denver), is a former Marine who was born in Trinidad, grew
up in Newark and East Orange, New Jersey, and has a master’s in urban
planning from the University of Illinois at Chicago. The only
African-American blockader I met, he’d recently been arrested, not once
but twice, for locking down at Keystone construction sites in Oklahoma.
He told me that he’d joined the blockade out of solidarity with other
activists and with people in frontline communities fighting the
industry, not out of any deep environmental commitment. “To me, the
environmental movement was far removed from blacks,” he said.

The fourth blockader was 22-year-old Matt Almonte. In December, he and
another activist named Glen Collins locked themselves to each other and
two 600-pound barrels filled with concrete inside part of the pipeline
that was under construction—and came close to being gravely injured when
police used machinery to pull the pipe sections apart by force. Though
he was charged only with misdemeanors, his bail was set at \$65,000, and
he spent a month in jail.

For Matt, a veteran of Occupy Tampa who grew up working-class in urban
New Jersey before his family moved to a “gated suburban thing” in south
Florida, the lasting impact of Tar Sands Blockade “was to show ‘ordinary
people’ that it’s absolutely vital to take direct action, and that even
in a community like East Texas, people are rising against the fossil
fuel industry.” He emphasized that trainings and actions are being
networked out across the country, in South Dakota, Oklahoma, and
elsewhere along the northern pipeline route and beyond—“places that
don’t typically see a lot of environmental resistance.” Matt seemed
impatient for more escalated direct action, the kind that was no longer
happening along the southern Keystone XL route. Shortly after we talked,
he and another member of Tar Sands Blockade decided to move on.

By the time I arrived in Nacogdoches, the blockaders’ numbers had
dwindled—some who had come from out of state had returned home or
drifted off to join other direct-action campaigns, against Keystone and
extraction projects—and the group was at something of a crossroads.
Indeed, they were wrestling not only with tactics and strategy but with
the very nature of the campaign, now that there was essentially nothing
left, in the near term, to blockade.

But a solid core of about twenty organizers, many of them young native
Texans, had regrouped in Houston and were shifting into something more
like community organizing, engaging with environmental justice efforts
on the city’s hard-hit, largely Latino east side. As several told me,
they wanted their campaign not only to carry on the fight against
Keystone and tar sands but to build a base of grassroots resistance to
the fossil fuel industry right there in Texas, especially in the
frontline communities—most often communities of color—that are most
affected by fossil fuel pollution. The kind of places, they point out,
where the climate movement has established little, if any, foothold.

Back in Houston, I sat down with several members of Tar Sands Blockade,
who talked with me openly about the campaign at this pivotal moment. Kim
Huynh, 26, was born in a Vietnamese refugee camp in Indonesia and
immigrated with her family to Florida, where she went to the University
of Florida and studied political science and sociology. A year ago, she
left a job with Friends of the Earth in Washington, DC, where she’d
focused on Keystone and climate, and came to Texas to join the blockade.
I asked Kim if she has any trouble reconciling the urgency of climate
action, as seen in the pipeline fight, with the kind of long-term
commitment required for movement-building.

“I certainly feel that tension,” she told me. “A lot of folks that I’ve
worked with feel that tension very strongly, feel it in their bodies.
It’s an anxiety.” At the same time, she said, she also feels “a
commitment to the idea that we need systemic change, like actually
hacking at the roots of what climate change is and what’s created
climate change.” That kind of change is a long-term thing, she
acknowledged. “It isn’t going to come just from stopping the pipeline.
Stopping the pipeline is a good start.”

“The challenge and struggle for TSB,” Kim said, “is to figure out how we
define escalation, as a campaign that started from this extremely
escalated place.”

“Personally,” she said, “I draw a lot of inspiration and lessons from
the black freedom movement, the civil rights movement, thinking about
groups like SNCC and the way they defined escalation as going into the
most deeply segregated areas in the South and doing voter registration.”
That’s a whole other kind of escalation, Kim said, “doing the organizing
in the areas where it’s possibly most important to do. Maybe that
strategy is less like direct action as we know it—lockdowns—and more
like community organizing. But that doesn’t mean it’s any
de-escalation.”

“The communities that are most impacted by these industries,” she said,
“the people who are living and breathing it every day—they need to be
leading the fight.”

That idea—the disproportionate impact not only of climate change but of
the fossil fuel industry on hard-pressed communities that can least
afford it—is at the heart of what Tar Sands Blockade means by climate
justice. They want a radical movement, one that grasps the problem
whole, at the roots of the system, and fights alongside those who are
already on the front lines—and always have been.

When I first met Ron Seifert, we were standing outside on a sweltering
early evening at Hartman Park in Houston’s Manchester neighborhood, just
east of the 610 Loop along the Houston Ship Channel, across the street
from a massive Valero refinery. Ron is a founding member of Tar Sands
Blockade—and, at 32, also among the oldest, with the first early flecks
of gray showing in his trim black beard. Having trained for years in
long-distance endurance racing, his slender frame seems to conceal a
reservoir of stamina. Ron grew up in Wisconsin and South Carolina and
came to Texas in late 2011 from Montana, where he’d been exploring grad
school in environmental science and law. He had joined the historic
sit-ins at the White House in August 2011 and was one of the 1,253
people arrested protesting the Keystone XL. Later that fall, along with
another activist named Tom Weis, Ron biked the full length of the
pipeline route, from Montana to Texas. In the spring and summer of 2012,
after Obama fast-tracked the southern leg, he helped launch Tar Sands
Blockade, together with members of Rising Tide North Texas, on landowner
David Daniel’s property near Winnsboro, in northeast Texas, site of the
storied eighty-five-day tree blockade.

Rural and small-town East Texas is a world away from Manchester.
Overwhelmingly Latino, the community is surrounded by oil refineries and
other heavily polluting industrial facilities—a chemical plant, a tire
plant, a car-crushing facility, a train yard and a sewage treatment
plant—and sits at the intersection of two major expressways. The people
who live there already breathe some of the country’s most toxic air, and
they have the health statistics to prove it. Not just asthma and other
respiratory problems—a recent investigation by researchers at the
University of Texas School of Public Health found that children living
within two miles of the Ship Channel have a 56 percent higher risk of
acute lymphocytic leukemia than those living only ten miles away. Yudith
Nieto, a local environmental justice organizer who grew up in
Manchester, told me of her family’s health struggles, including her own
childhood asthma, which improved when she moved out of the neighborhood
to attend art school.

The Ship Channel and nearby refineries—along with the refineries near
the poor and African-American communities of Port Arthur—are also a
prime destination for the vast majority of tar sands crude that will
flow from Alberta to the Texas Gulf via the Keystone XL if it’s
approved, only increasing the toxic emissions in these fence-line
neighborhoods.

I was there in Manchester that evening to tag along with members of Tar
Sands Blockade as they canvassed the community door to door, conducting
a health survey in collaboration with the local Houston group TEJAS
(Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services) and letting residents
know about the upcoming Healthy Manchester Festival there at the park.
Later, TEJAS co-founders Juan Parras, a longtime labor and environmental
justice organizer, and his son Bryan talked with me about the challenges
the climate movement faces in places like Manchester, or anyplace where
immediate health, economic and social pressures are paramount. Broadly
speaking, Bryan Parras told me, most efforts at climate action “tend to
leave the same folks that are already in bad situations in bad
situations. There’s no incentive for them to get involved.” (He expanded
on this and other ideas in an interview posted on my blog at
TheNation.com.)

Robert Bullard, dean of the Barbara Jordan–Mickey Leland School of
Public Affairs at Texas Southern University in Houston, is widely
acknowledged as the father of the environmental justice movement, thanks
to his pioneering work on the disproportionate impacts of pollution in
African-American communities, documented in his landmark 1990 book,
Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality. “We could stop
every pipeline being built from Canada to Texas, we could stop every
fracking operation, and still not deal with the justice question—what
happens in these communities,” Bullard told me. “What we’re trying to
drive home with our friends and colleagues in our larger environmental
movement, our larger climate movement, is to talk about these
communities that are at greatest risk, put a real face on this. Make it
real.”

Tar Sands Blockade is listening to what those like Parras and Bullard
are saying. “Disproportionate impact is very real,” Ron said. “And what
the communities that are most disproportionately affected actually look
like—we need to acknowledge the reality of that, and to understand that
climate justice is tied in with racial justice, with environmental
justice, with class struggle.”

Ron told me that Tar Sands Blockade wants to support and amplify the
work of TEJAS and other environmental justice groups in Texas, not try
to commandeer it. He and his Tar Sands Blockade colleagues are highly
conscious of what might be called the “parachuter syndrome,” in which
outside activist groups, however well intentioned, are perceived to be
pursuing their own agendas. Given that apparent tension, I asked Ron if
there’s not a disconnect of sorts between the kind of urgent climate
action that Tar Sands Blockade has embodied (literally) in its direct
action campaign and the slower, and in some ways more difficult, work of
environmental justice organizing in these communities.

Maybe, he said. But, ultimately, “it doesn’t matter.”

“Pipelines and refineries and droughts—those are not different things,”
Ron continued. “That is climate change. The refineries are climate
change. Keystone XL is climate change. Tar sands exploitation is climate
change. It’s all the same thing. And we understand that these
communities are bearing the brunt of this industry—which is one and the
same as climate change. And it’s in their backyards.”

“We’re not there to tell them what the problem is and what to do about
it,” Ron said. “It’s the same as organizing with landowners in East
Texas. We’re not salespeople coming to these communities saying, ‘Time
to rise up!’ People have cancer, leukemia. They have children in the
neighborhood die. They understand this industry will kill you for
profits.”

Over the course of multiple conversations, Ron told me that a core group
of Tar Sands Blockade organizers are dedicating themselves to the kind
of climate justice organizing that national environmental groups aren’t
doing in Texas. From the start, Ron said, Tar Sands Blockade has shown a
willingness to defy a status quo within the larger movement, in which
only “winnable campaigns” are taken on—and funded. With the fight in
East Texas, and by digging in now for the longer, even harder fight in
Houston, “we’ve been able to say, ‘This is worth fighting no matter
what, even if it looks like we can’t win.’”

“That type of real investment and commitment,” Ron said, “the idea that
you have to go into where the problem is worst—like Mississippi during
the civil rights era—you have to get in there and get a foothold. We
hope we can empower local-led action and resistance. In Houston itself,
there are literally millions of people who are being poisoned. We should
be able to empower folks here to rise up and defend their own homes.”

“If the climate movement is ever going to win in a really robust way,
it’s gotta come to Texas, the belly of the beast,” Ron told me.
“Houston, and the Texas Gulf, is the lion’s den—the largest
petrochemical complex on planet Earth. If the base isn’t there, if the
communities there aren’t organized and informed, empowered to take
action, the movement isn’t going to be successful when it needs to be.”

“The industry,” Ron said, “has shown every intention of escalating the
climate crisis beyond certain tipping points, and people in these
communities are affected by the industry right now, in desperate ways.”
In a situation like this, he said, “we need to ask ourselves as
organizers, ‘What does escalation look like? What could possibly be too
escalated?’ Physically blockading infrastructure is a great place to
start that conversation.” They may have failed to stop the construction
of the southern pipeline, “but we can still build and cultivate a
culture of resistance and action, capable of escalating to the point of
shutting this stuff down in the future.”

I asked him what happens if Obama approves the Keystone XL and
construction of the northern segment begins. Will Tar Sands Blockade
still be committed to Texas? “I can guarantee you that if that segment
is approved, and our friends and allies in Montana and South Dakota and
Nebraska give us a call, there will be physical blockades in those areas
as well, by local folks interested in that kind of resistance. But that
doesn’t mean abandoning our base in Houston and East Texas. These are
not mutually exclusive things.”

“There are two distinct lines of work that need to be done
simultaneously,” he said. “One is to smash these systems that are
oppressing us and destroying the world. The other is to build up the
world that we want to see.”

“It’s a long-term commitment that we are making,” Ron said.

Before I left Nacogdoches, the blockaders gave me directions to their
camp outside town. I arrived mid-morning, and the four I’d interviewed
at the church were the only ones there. Murtaza showed me around. There
was the small, ramshackle house that was used as a makeshift HQ and the
communal outdoor kitchen under a blue plastic tarp, which had served
fifty or more at one time. There was the outhouse that one of the Austin
Heights members had built for them. As we walked a footpath into the
woods in back, I saw the few remaining tents and an ingeniously rigged
(if less than private) shower. Some climbing tackle still hung from a
large tree. Nearby was a big pile of buckets and containers once used
for hauling water. Murtaza thought the camp now had a vaguely
post-apocalyptic look to it—or perhaps, I thought, like a guerrilla
encampment after the battle shifts to new ground.

After my tour, I sat down with Fitzgerald at the picnic table by the
kitchen, next to a campfire he was tending. I asked him if the
“blockade,” as such, was over.

“It’s hard to define ‘over,’” he replied. “When I got here, blockading
was as direct action as direct action can get. That part of TSB in
Texas, I think, is done.”

What about building a deeper resistance that can go forward?

“TSB didn’t come here to create a resistance,” he said. “That resistance
already existed. We partnered in that resistance, and we’re still
partnering in it.”

Had Tar Sands Blockade strengthened that resistance? “Without a doubt,”
he answered. “As far as resistance is concerned, we are far from done.”

Since we spoke, Fitzgerald has moved to the Beaumont–Port Arthur area,
engaging in environmental justice work with the African-American
communities there. But he told me that he and the others want to remain
engaged with Nacogdoches. He feels close to the Austin Heights
community, and he’s been reaching out to the Zion Hill congregation.
“I’m trying to get the African-American community more involved,” he
said, “because that’s just where I come from.”

The next weekend in Nacogdoches, I sat down again with Kyle Childress,
this time in his office at the church. A portrait of Martin Luther King
Jr. hangs on the wall. I told him, only half joking, that it was a
little intimidating to sit there under Dr. King’s gaze.

“There’s a line in the old King James,” Childress told me, “that says
the prayers of a faithful person ‘availeth much.’ One person, one small
community, acting in faithfulness, can bring healing, hope, change.”

“Some of these blockaders,” he said, “were risking their lives up there
in a tree trying to block that pipeline. And TransCanada has billions of
dollars and says, ‘We’ll just go around you. You slowed us down for a
day.’ Well, if that’s all there is, by sheer mathematics they win. But I
think the prayers of a faithful person availeth much—and those
blockaders are acting in fidelity to the goodness, the rightness, of
God’s earth. That keeps me going. That’s my hope. And if I didn’t have
hope, well, I’d probably just cash it in and go do something else for a
living. I mean, you know, I’m not going to be pastor of a church without
any hope.”
