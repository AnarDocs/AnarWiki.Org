title="Syrian Civil War">Syrian Civil War</a>.

## Background

Following Syria's <a href="decolonisation" class="wikilink"
title="decolonisation">decolonisation</a> by the
<a href="French_Empire" class="wikilink" title="French Empire">French
Empire</a> in 1946, it enjoyed a brief period of
<a href="Representative_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="representative democracy">representative democracy</a> before the
military took over in a controversial coup in 1949 (with
<a href="Timeline_of_US_Imperialism" class="wikilink"
title="alleged CIA help">alleged CIA help</a>). Frequent coups, military
revolts, civil disorders and bloody riots dominated the country until
the Ba'ath party took power in a military coup in 1963 and ruled as a
secular one-party state until the revolution. This led to a rise in
opposition from not only democracy activists but also leftists and
Islamists.

Increasing economic stagnation triggered by privatisation of the economy
in the 1990s, high unemployment and a severe drought (triggered by
climate change) led to mass migration into cities from rural areas.
These factors combined with the government's restriction of civil
liberties and lack of political democracy led to the perfect ingredients
for a revolution. Once the Arab Spring was triggered by revolutions in
<a href="Tunisian_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and
<a href="Egyptian_Revolution_(2011)" class="wikilink"
title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, it soon followed in Syria.

## Events

### Initial Protests

On 28 January 2011, Hassan Ali Akleh set himself on fire in the town of
Hasakeh, in northeastern Syria, repeating Mohamed Bouazizi's famous act
of self-immolation the prior month in Tunisia. Protests spread around
Syria, including at the Tunisian, Egyptian, and Libyan embassies.

Major unrest began on the 15th of March in Damascus, Syria's capital
city following the arrest and torture of 15 young students who had been
caught writing anti-government graffiti in the city of Deraa. They were
tortured and had their fingernails ripped out. When parents met with the
local head of political security, who happened to be President Bashar
al-Assad's cousin, he responded, "Forget your children. Go sleep with
your wives and make new ones, or send them to me and I'll do it." When
thousands gathered to demand the children's release and the security
head's resignation, four protesters were killed. The funeral the next
day turned into another protest, and more protesters were killed by
security forces.

On 15 March, protesters assembled in Damascus and decided they would
form Local Coordinating Committees (LCCs) in their communities to
coordinate street protests, document security forces' responses, and
advocate on social media. Protesters demanded the release of political
prisoners, the abolition of Syria's 48-year emergency law, more
freedoms, and an end to pervasive government corruption.

The events led to a "Friday of Dignity" on 18 March, when large-scale
protests broke out in several cities, including Banias, Damascus,
al-Hasakah, Daraa, Deir az-Zor, and Hama. Security forces attacked
protesters gathered at the Omari Mosque using water cannons and tear
gas, followed by live fire, killing at least 6 people and injuring many
others.

On the 20th of March, protesters burnt down the Ba'ath Party
headquarters and other public buildings in Damascus, leading to police
shooting at crowds, prompting protesters to fight back. In two days, 15
protesters and 7 police officers were killed. On the 25th of March, mass
protests spread nationwide, as demonstrators emerged after Friday
prayers. At least 20 protesters were reportedly killed by security
forces. Protests subsequently spread to other Syrian cities, including
Homs, Hama, Baniyas, Jasim, Aleppo, Damascus and Latakia. Over 70
protesters in total were reported killed. The government claimed the
protesters were foreign agents and terrorists.

### Government Response and Escalation

The government began to arrest tens of thousands of people without trial
in order to attack political activists. Many of those detained
experienced ill-treatment. Many detainees were cramped in tight rooms
and were given limited resources, and some were beaten, electrically
jolted, or debilitated. Checkpoints were installed and large amounts of
police were deployed to destroy
<a href="Protest_Camp" class="wikilink" title="protest camps">protest
camps</a> while at the same time offering political reforms such as
shorter conscription time, firing corrupt officials, releasing political
prisoners, cutting taxes, creating jobs, lifting restrictions on the
press and raising wages of public sector workers. These reforms were
never implemented, however, the government did reverse the ban on
wearing the Niqab at school and granted citizenship to thousands of
Kurdish people and tried to hold a national dialogue that protesters
refused to attend.

In April, the government began to deploy the military against
protesters. Soldiers conducted house to house searches and executed
protesters. Tanks were used for the first time against demonstrators,
and snipers took positions on the rooftops of mosques. Mosques used as
headquarters for demonstrators and organizers were especially targeted.
The military began shutting off water, power and phone lines, and
confiscating flour and food. By 3 June, the UN reported that 1,000 had
been killed and a minimum of 3,000 detained.

Armed protesters and defecting soldiers fought back, killing hundreds of
people, but the protests had largely been suppressed by the 5th of May.
Opposition fighters soon became better equipped and organised and two
senior military officers defected. Angry protesters on the 4th of June
in Jisr ash-Shugur, set fire to a building where the army had fired on a
funeral demonstration. Eight soldiers died in the fire as demonstrators
took control of a police station, seizing weapons. Clashes between
protesters and the army continued in the following days. Soldiers began
defecting after the secret police executed soldiers who refused to kill
civilians. 10,000 people soon fled into Turkey, an
<a href="Syrian_Refugee_Crisis" class="wikilink"
title="eery foreshadowing of what was to come">eery foreshadowing of
what was to come</a>.

On 9 June 2011, the Syrian military's Lieutenant Colonel Hussein
Harmoush publicly defected and called for the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a
network of militias. On the 29th of July, a group of defected officers
officially announced the formation of the
<a href="Free_Syrian_Army" class="wikilink"
title="Free Syrian Army">Free Syrian Army</a>. Composed of defected
Syrian Armed Forces personnel, the rebel army sought to remove dictator
Bashar al-Assad and his government from power. With such a significant
defection from the state, a
<a href="Civil_War" class="wikilink" title="civil war">civil war</a> had
begun.

With the militarization of the movement in the summer and fall of 2011
came the Islamization of many strands, undoing much of the horizontal
organization that characterized the rebellion early on.

## Self-Governance and Revolutionary Organization

### Local Coordinating Committees

LCCs quickly formed around the country and, over time, expanded their
activities to include distribution of food and medical services. In
October 2011, the LCCs and other groups coordinated strikes in 600
locations around Syria. In an LCC in Damascus, decisions were made by
voting and leadership rotated monthly.

Some branches of the Syrian Revolution have remained explicitly leftist,
including the Revolutionary Left Current, which established an armed
brigade in March 2014.

### Local Councils

Many currents have been strongly influenced by the anarchist theorist
and economist Omar Aziz, who wrote a paper proposing a network of local
self-government to replace the state. Influential revolutionary writings
by Aziz called for liberated communities to stop operating according to
"authority's time" and start living in "revolutionary time." This meant
transcending the separation between "the tasks necessary to live in this
world and revolutionary activities." The shift entails a full
transformation of everyday life.

Local councils based on Aziz's vision spread in 2012, distributing aid,
water, electricity, and education, disposing of waste disposal, and
coordinating security with militias. Aziz was arrested on 20 November
2012, and he died in prison in February 2013, at the age of 63.

An August 2016 article reported that there were some 400 local councils
across liberated Syria that were experimenting in stateless forms of
self-governance. The councils tend to make decisions by majority vote,
and some hold elections every three or six months to give residents a
chance to recall representatives.

### Daraya and Aleppo Examples

The liberated town of Daraya, before it was re-captured by the Assad
regime in August 2016, had an active local council with offices to
manage various community affairs. A relief office ran a soup kitchen and
grew spinach, wheat, and beans. A medical office managed a field
hospital. A services office was responsible for opening alternative
roads when regime bombing made the normal roads unusable. The local
brigade of the Free Syrian Army was subject to the local council's
civilian control. Women established a revolutionary magazine, *Enab
Baladi*, that regularly promoted civil disobedience. The town came under
intense assault, with 9,000 imprecise "barrel bombs" dropped daily by
the government at the same time as the regime blocked food and medical
supplies from entering Daraya for 1,368 days. The town's residents ended
up evacuating to Idlib.

Prior to the Assad regime's recapture of Aleppo in December 2016, the
city's local council posted meeting minutes online detailing their work
including "repairing phone lines, cleaning the streets, fixing water
pipes, running courses to train and empower women, implementing price
controls on commodities \[and\] distributing bread."

According to the Swiss-Syrian academic, Joseph Daher, about half of the
local councils were democratically elected and the number and strength
of councils had greatly declined after Assad's capture of Eastern Aleppo
in December 2016. Daher offers critical though appreciative account of
the local councils:

> Regarding local councils that played an important role in the
> opposition held areas, we must be clear that their very important
> experiences did not mean that there were no shortcomings, such as the
> lack of representation of women, or of religious minorities in
> general. Other problems existed as well such as some forms of
> disorganization, undemocratic practices, over-representation of some
> influential families in some areas, etc. Civil councils were also not
> always completely autonomous from military groups, relying often on
> military groups for resources. While numerous council members were
> generally elected, nearly half of them, there were also a number of
> councils undemocratically appointed rather than elected, based on the
> influence of local military leaders, clan and family structures, and
> elders. Another problem that was encountered in the selection of the
> council's representatives was the need for particular professional and
> technical skills.
>
> Despite these limitations, local councils were able to restore a
> minimum level of social services in their regions and enjoyed some
> level of legitimacy.

### 15th Garden

<a href="15th_Garden" class="wikilink" title="15th Garden">15th
Garden</a> is or was a bottom-up urban agriculture network across 17
cities in Syria. It campaigned for food sovereignty and belonged to the
<a href="Syrian_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Syrian Revolution">Syrian Revolution</a>. The name came from the
revolution's birthday of March 15th, 2011.

In 2016,
<a href="La_Via_Campesina" class="wikilink" title="La Via Campesina">La
Via Campesina</a> shared a report by 15th Garden describing some of the
Syrian movement's activities:

> "There are community gardens that built the capacity to feed thousands
> of people, there are farmers' networks for work and skill exchange,
> there are seed reproducers and sharers, there are bakeries built and
> re-built, there are developments of mobile grain mills and networks
> for educating communities in closed-cycle methods: like trash
> recycling, small scale bio gas producing and local fertilizing
> cycles."

## Foreign Involvement and Militarization

### Foreign Support for Rebels

A "conservative" estimate of the quantity of arms supplied to rebels by
the US/GCC has been calculated as amounting to at least 3,500 tons, in
accordance with the findings of the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute. Indian Marxist Aijaz Ahmad cites estimates that
Qatar has provided between \$2 and \$6 billion to rebel forces in Syria.
Officially, the U.S. gave only "non-lethal aid" to Free Syrian Army
units in the first couple years of the civil war, though numerous
stockpiles of US-made heavy weapons as well as tanks and
armored-personnel personnel carriers have made it into the hands of
ISIS—"appropriated," the story goes, as they were by ISIS from other
anti-regime forces, as well as Iraqi Army units, who surrendered Mosul.

### Relationship with United States and Turkey

The U.S. military, despite ostensibly supporting and arming the FSA in
order to combat ISIS, has been uninterested in supporting the rebels'
revolutionary aims or even in protecting Syrian civilian lives, let
alone deposing of Bashar al-Assad. In fighting ISIS, the US massacred
Syrian civilians in places such as Raqqa, while the campaign had ground
support from Rojava's SDF. While US war planes had no problem dropping
bombs on Syria, they repeatedly declined to drop food and supplies to
areas under siege from Assad. In part, the US cited fears that jihadists
might get their hands on the food, leading critics to point out the
obvious: "we're talking about food, not guns. \[...\] We say drop food,
not bombs."

Prior to 2017, the only time the US attacked an Assad regime target was
in September 2016, when it accidentally killed 62 regime troops. The US
quickly apologized and offered "condolence payments" to the troops'
families. American journalist Bill Weinberg argued at the time, "The US
is now openly fighting on the side of the Assad dictatorship. Anyone who
fails to see it simply isn't paying attention." In July 2017, the United
States stopped funding Syrian rebels. In December 2018, the US announced
that it would begin rapidly withdrawing 2000 ground troops from Syria.
The Alliance of Middle East Socialists denounced this move as "a green
light to Recep Tayyip Erdogan to decimate the Kurds in what remains of
Rojava in northern Syria."

Leaders of the Syrian National Council and the National Coalition of
Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the two centralized national
coalitions that formed out of the Syrian Revolution, developed alliances
with the Turkish government. These alliances precluded the possibility
of an Arab-Kurdish alliance against Assad.

## Rojava

In the primarily Kurdish region of northern Syria, or Rojava, Syrian
security forces withdrew in 2012 and the roughly 2.5 million residents
have organized a federation of communes inspired by the
anti-authoritarian, feminist writings of the Kurdish dissident and
political prisoner Abdullah Öcalan. At each level of decision-making, at
least 40 percent of delegates are women. Communes organize worker
cooperatives, environmental protection units, security forces, and more.
At the federal level, government takes a representative, parliamentary
form that, to many anti-authoritarians, resembles at least a
proto-state, although by some accounts its ability to impose its will on
local communities remains limited since security forces remain
answerable to the local bodies. Anti-authoritarians have criticized
Rojava's revolution for maintaining prisons and arbitrary arresting
dissidents, and for coordinating closely with US and Russian imperialist
interests in the fight against Daesh.

### Relationship with Syrian Revolution

At times, the Syrian revolution and Rojava revolution have collaborated.
In 2014, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) collaborated with the Kurdish
militia known as the YPG, a Rojava milita, to fight ISIS. A minority of
FSA groups have joined the YPG in forming the Rojava-aligned Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF). In a 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, a high-level
Rojava official wrote that the Kurdish struggle shares the broader
Syrian rebels' aim of replacing the Assad government with a
decentralized democracy.

However, the relation between the predominantly Kurdish rebels of Rojava
and the predominantly Arab rebels in the rest of Syria has been uneasy,
and at times there has been fighting between the movements. FSA groups
assisted Turkey in taking five villages from the SDF in August 2016.
Many Syrians have strongly criticized the SDF. For instance, Hassan
Hamidi, in the SDF-liberated, predominantly Arab town of Mabij, told
*Now Media*, "We really appreciate everything the SDF fighters did in
order to push ISIS out of Manbij. But it seems that we are moving from
one dictator to another. Manbij's local council, which was elected to
run the city, was uprooted by ISIS before and now it is dissolved by the
SDF."

## Results

Syrian journalists Robin Yassin-Kassab and Leila al-Shami, in their
authoritative English-language *Burning Country*, summarize the
anti-authoritarian ethos of the revolution:

> In 2011 it burst into speech - not one voice but in millions. On an
> immense surge of long-suppressed, a non-violent protest movement
> crossed sectarian and ethnic boundaries and spread to every part of
> the country. Nobody could control it - no party, leader or ideological
> programme, and least of all the repressive apparatus of the state,
> which applied gunfire, mass detention, sexual assault and torture,
> even of children, to death.
