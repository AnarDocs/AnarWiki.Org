Works</a>:

> A particularly remarkable network of autonomous villages can be found
> in the mountains around Itoiz, in Navarra, part of the Basque country.
> The oldest of these, Lakabe, has been occupied for twenty-eight years
> as of this writing, and is home to about thirty people. A project of
> love, Lakabe challenges and changes the traditional aesthetic of rural
> poverty. The floors and walkways are beautiful mosaics of stone and
> tile, and the newest house to be built there could pass for the luxury
> retreat of a millionaire — except that it was built by the people who
> live there, and designed in harmony with the environment, to catch the
> sun and keep out the cold. Lakabe houses a communal bakery and a
> communal dining room, which on a normal day hosts delicious feasts
> that the whole village eats together.
>
> Another of the villages around Itoiz, Aritzkuren, exemplifies a
> certain aesthetic that represents another idea of history. Thirteen
> years ago, a handful of people occupied the village, which had been
> abandoned for over fifty years before that. Since then, they have
> constructed all their dwellings within the ruins of the old hamlet.
> Half of Aritzkuren is still ruins, slowly decomposing into forest on a
> mountainside an hour’s drive from the nearest paved road. The ruins
> are a reminder of the origin and foundation of the living parts of the
> village, and they serve as storage spaces for building materials that
> will be used to renovate the rest of it. The new sense of history that
> lives amidst these piled stones is neither linear nor amnesiac, but
> organic — in that the past is the shell of the present and compost of
> the future. It is also post-capitalist, suggesting a return to the
> land and the creation of a new society in the ruins of the old.
>
> Uli, another of the abandoned and reoccupied villages, disbanded after
> more than a decade of autonomous existence; but the success rate of
> all the villages together is encouraging, with five out of six still
> going strong. The “failure” of Uli demonstrates another advantage of
> anarchist organizing: a collective can dissolve itself rather than
> remaining stuck in a mistake forever or suppressing individual needs
> to perpetuate an artificial collectivity. These villages in their
> prior incarnations, a century earlier, were only dissolved by the
> economic catastrophe of industrializing capitalism. Otherwise, their
> members were held fast by a conservative kinship system rigidly
> enforced by the church.
>
> At Aritzkuren as at other autonomous villages throughout the world,
> life is both laborious and relaxed. The residents must build all their
> infrastructure themselves and create most of the things they need with
> their own hands, so there is plenty of work to do. People get up in
> the morning and work on their own projects, or else everyone comes
> together for a collective effort decided on at a previous meeting.
> Following a huge lunch which one person cooks for everyone on a
> rotating basis, people have the whole afternoon to relax, read, go
> into town, work in the garden, or fix up a building. Some days, nobody
> works at all; if one person decides to skip a day, there are no
> recriminations, because there are meetings at which to make sure
> responsibilities are evenly distributed. In this context,
> characterized by a close connection to nature, inviolable individual
> freedom mixed with a collective social life, and the blurring of work
> and pleasure, the people of Aritzkuren have created not only a new
> lifestyle, but an ethos compatible with living in an anarchist
> society.
>
> The school they are building at Aritzkuren is a powerful symbol of
> this. A number of children live at Aritzkuren and the other villages.
> Their environment already provides a wealth of learning opportunities,
> but there is much desire for a formal educational setting and a chance
> to employ alternative teaching methods in a project that can be
> accessible to children from the entire region.
>
> As the school indicates, the autonomous villages violate the
> stereotype of the hippy commune as an escapist attempt to create a
> utopia in microcosm rather than change the existing world. Despite
> their physical isolation, these villages are very much involved in the
> outside world and in social movements struggling to change it. The
> residents share their experiences in creating sustainable collectives
> with other anarchist and autonomous collectives throughout the
> country. Many people divide each year between the village and the
> city, balancing a more utopian existence with participation in ongoing
> struggles. The villages also serve as a refuge for activists taking a
> break from stressful city life. Many of the villages carry on projects
> that keep them involved in social struggles; for example, one
> autonomous village in Italy provides a peaceful setting for a group
> that translates radical texts. Likewise, the villages around Itoiz
> have been a major part of the twenty-year-running resistance to the
> hydroelectric dam there.
>
> For about ten years, starting with the occupation of Rala, near
> Aritzkuren, the autonomous villages around Itoiz have created a
> network, sharing tools, materials, expertise, food, seeds, and other
> resources. They meet periodically to discuss mutual aid and common
> projects; residents of one village will drop by another to eat lunch,
> talk, and, perhaps, deliver a dozen extra raspberry plants. They also
> participate in annual gatherings that bring together autonomous
> communities from all over Spain to discuss the process of building
> sustainable collectives. At these, each group presents a problem it
> has been unable to resolve, such as sharing responsibilities or
> putting consensus decisions into practice. Then they each offer to
> mediate while another collective discusses their problem — preferably
> a problem the mediating group has experience resolving.
