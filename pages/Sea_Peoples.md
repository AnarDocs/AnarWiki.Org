> Chronicles of the Egyptian state mention a series of seafaring raiders
> as well as land-based invaders whom modern researchers named as the
> “Sea Peoples.” Probably originating from around the Aegean Sea, they
> warred with states in the areas of modern-day Turkey, Syria,
> Palestine, and Egypt. Their raiding was so calamitous that some
> scholars propose them as a cause for the Bronze Age collapse. It seems
> likely that some if not all of the Sea Peoples were stateless, and
> their warfare may have been in part motivated by hostility to the
> states of the region. The Egyptian, Hittite, and Mycenaean states, to
> name the principal players, were involved in a long-standing power
> play and scramble for resources that kept the region immersed in
> warfare, the worst consequences of which were born by the lower
> strata, the common people. And as we have seen, a major activity of
> state formation is slave-raiding and the capture of entire
> populations, which also leads to many people fleeing to zones of
> resistance (possibly in the mountains and islands that made up the
> Aegean and its borders). As the states grew in power and the liberated
> zones filled up, there would be more pressure on fugitive populations
> to fight back.
>
> Evidence for the statelessness of the Sea Peoples includes their use
> of oral history and their lack of writing, which also denotes a lack
> of bureaucracy; their nomadism and extreme mobility; their apparent
> use of confederal alliances between different peoples; their
> impressive military efficiency without a corresponding founding of
> dynasties or cities (state societies that are militarily effective are
> invariably prolific founders and builders); their oscillation between
> warring against neighboring states and hiring themselves out as
> mercenaries. All of these are characteristics of stateless peoples at
> the time, at least in areas devastated by state effects.
>
> If this is the case, the appearance of the Sea Peoples would
> constitute ethnogenesis, the creation of a new people or ethnic group,
> in this case one constituted by runaway slaves and fragments of
> communities fleeing the warfare and slave-raiding of states. Such a
> process constituted the preeminent model for revolution at the time.
> Without internationalism, freedom would have been an ethnic property.
> Unfortunately, as in the case of the nomadic empires, we have seen how
> such ethnicities can eventually shift from being the antagonists of
> states to the founders of states. The relative strength of the values
> of anti-authoritarianism, on the one hand, and militarism, on the
> other, as well as the presence or absence of patriarchy, probably
> determine whether a liberated people become a new politogen.
