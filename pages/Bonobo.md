Bonobos are a Central African great ape that exhibit almost no social
hierarchy or aggression. According to primatologist Frans de Waal, “The
species is best characterized as female-centered and egalitarian and as
one that substitutes sex for aggression.”[^1]

Along with the common chimpanzee, they are the closest relatives to
human beings.[^2]

# Social Structure

From foraging to play, bonobos stay together in small, temporary groups.
“Several bonobos traveling together in the morning might meet another
group in the forest, whereupon one individual from the first group
wanders off with others from the second group, while those left behind
forage together.”[^3]

There are hierarchies among males and among females, but these
hierarchies are not all that important. Males do not dominate females,
and if anything, the opposite is true. Christopher Boehm considers
bonobos to be more egalitarian than human hunter-gatherer societies.[^4]

According to De Waal, “Bonobo society is, however, not only
female-centered but also appears to be female-dominated.”[^5]

# Diet

Bonobos eat mostly fruit, and aside from eating invertebrates and the
occasional small vertebrate, “their diet seems to contain relatively
little animal protein.”[^6]

# Peacefulness

De Waal reports that fighting between bonobos is “unusual”:

> Serious conflict between bonobo groups has been witnessed in the
> field, but it seems quite rare. On the contrary, reports exist of
> peaceable mingling, including mutual sex and grooming, between what
> appear to be different communities. If intergroup combat is indeed
> unusual, it may explain the lower rate of all-male associations.[^7]

# Play and Sex

Bonobos are fond of play, such as making funny faces and tickling each
other. De Waal has seen them play “blindman's buff”, in which a bonobo
covers her eyes and walking until she loses balance.[^8]

Bonobos are, famously, fond of sex and erotic behavior, not just for
reproduction and not just heterosexually. Females commonly rub their
genitals together, and males will penis-fence and rub one's scrotum to
another's buttocks.[^9] Often, two feuding bonobos will engage in sexual
activity as a substitute for fighting each other:

> I once observed a young male, Kako, inadvertently blocking an older,
> female juvenile, Leslie, from moving along a branch. First, Leslie
> pushed him; Kako, who was not very confident in trees, tightened his
> grip, grinning nervously. Next Leslie gnawed on one of his hands,
> presumably to loosen his grasp. Kako uttered a sharp peep and stayed
> put. Then Leslie rubbed her vulva against his shoulder. This gesture
> calmed Kako, and he moved along the branch. It seemed that Leslie had
> been very close to using force but instead had reassured both herself
> and Kako with sexual contact.[^10]

## Matriarchy

Female bonobos, despite being smaller than males, often dominate the
social hierarchy and have a significant influence on the group's
dynamics. Female bonobos form strong social bonds with each other, often
working together to maintain their dominant position within the group.

Females can influence male behavior by forming coalitions, intervening
in conflicts, and selectively mating with males who are less aggressive.
Older female bonobos are known to lead the group in terms of direction
and decision-making.
