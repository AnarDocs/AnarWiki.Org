**ProleWiki** is a "<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> online encyclopedia
founded in September 2020 that presents itself as providing
anti-imperialist proletarian perspectives on history, current events,
and political theory. While the project has grown to include multiple
language editions and maintains an extensive library of Marxist texts,
its treatment of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
reflects longstanding authoritarian socialist mischaracterizations that
fundamentally misunderstand anarchist theory and practice.

## Overview

ProleWiki was created on September 30, 2020, and has since expanded to
nine languages with over 3,000 articles. The project explicitly adopts a
Marxist-Leninist ideological framework and has implemented various
governance structures, including an account request system and
democratic reforms allowing editors to vote on new members. The site
experienced several internal conflicts, including what it terms a "purge
of patriotic socialists" in 2022 and an "ultra-left subversion attempt"
by a Hoxhaist editor.

The encyclopedia's stated goal is to build an anti-imperialist
proletarian collection of information, though its rigid adherence to
orthodox Marxist-Leninist positions often leads to dismissive or hostile
treatment of other socialist tendencies, particularly anarchism.

## Misrepresentation of Anarchism

ProleWiki's article on anarchism perpetuates several fundamental
misconceptions about anarchist theory that have been standard in
Marxist-Leninist discourse since the 19th century disputes between Marx
and Bakunin. These mischaracterizations reveal not just disagreement but
a failure to engage seriously with anarchist political philosophy.

### The "Petty-Bourgeois" Characterization

ProleWiki claims that anarchism's philosophical basis consists of
"<a   href="individualism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualism">individualism</a>,
"<a   href="subjectivism.md" class="wikilink"
title="subjectivism">subjectivism</a>, and
"<a   href="voluntarism.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntarism">voluntarism</a>, categorizing these as
"petty-bourgeois deviations from proletarian struggle." This
characterization fundamentally misunderstands anarchism's theoretical
foundations.

Anarchism is not based on individualism, subjectivism, or voluntarism,
but rather on a systematic analysis of
"<a   href="hierarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a> and
"<a   href="domination.md" class="wikilink" title="domination">domination</a>
as social relations. Classical anarchist theorists like
"<a   href="Mikhail_Bakunin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> and
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> developed materialist analyses of power structures that
predate and in some cases influenced Marxist theory. Kropotkin's
*"<a   href="Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution">Mutual Aid: A Factor of
Evolution</a>* provided an evolutionary and anthropological basis for
anarchist communism, while Bakunin's critiques of state power analyzed
how concentrated authority reproduces class relations regardless of who
controls the state apparatus.

The "petty-bourgeois" label is particularly ironic given anarchism's
historical base in industrial working-class movements.
"<a   href="Anarcho-syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-syndicalism">Anarcho-syndicalism</a> emerged directly
from revolutionary labor organizing, with the
"<a   href="CNT-FAI.md" class="wikilink" title="CNT-FAI">CNT-FAI</a> in Spain
representing over one million workers at its height. The notion that
anarchism represents petit-bourgeois interests ignores its actual social
base in militant labor movements, peasant uprisings, and revolutionary
workers' councils.

### Understanding Exploitation and Class Struggle

ProleWiki asserts that "anarchism does not go beyond general phrases
against exploitation, it does not understand what the causes of
exploitation are, nor the class struggle as a creative force for the
realization of socialism." This claim is demonstrably false and reflects
ignorance of anarchist economic theory.

Anarchist theorists have provided detailed analyses of exploitation and
class relations:

- Proudhon's critique of
  "<a   href="property.md" class="wikilink" title="property">property</a> as
  theft analyzed how property rights enable exploitation through rent,
  interest, and profit
- Bakunin identified the
  "<a   href="state.md" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> itself as an
  instrument of class domination, arguing that political power and
  economic exploitation are inseparable
- Kropotkin's analysis of
  "<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
  examined how monopolies, land ownership, and state intervention create
  and maintain exploitative economic relations
- Modern anarchists like
  "<a   href="Noam_Chomsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam
  Chomsky</a> and
  "<a   href="David_Graeber.md" class="wikilink" title="David Graeber">David
  Graeber</a> have contributed sophisticated analyses of contemporary
  capitalism, imperialism, and class structure

Anarchists understand class struggle not as something directed by a
revolutionary party toward state seizure, but as direct action by
workers and oppressed peoples to reclaim control over their own lives.
This is not a rejection of class analysis but a different strategic
understanding of how liberation occurs.

### Lenin's False Distinctions

ProleWiki reproduces Lenin's characterization of differences between
Marxists and anarchists, which misrepresents anarchist positions on
three key points:

**On the withering away of the state:** Lenin claimed anarchists "want
to completely destroy the State overnight, without understanding the
conditions in which this destruction can take place." In reality,
anarchists have always recognized that eliminating the state requires
building alternative institutions. The experience of
"<a   href="Revolutionary_Catalonia_(1936-1939).md" class="wikilink"
title="Revolutionary Catalonia">Revolutionary Catalonia</a>, the
"<a   href="Makhnovist_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovist movement">Makhnovist movement</a> in Ukraine, and
contemporary experiments in
"<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> demonstrate
anarchist understanding of transitional processes. The difference is not
between immediate versus gradual abolition, but between building
"<a   href="dual_power.md" class="wikilink" title="dual power">dual power</a>
structures that prefigure a free society versus creating a new state
apparatus that anarchists argue inevitably reproduces hierarchical
relations.

**On replacing the state machine:** Anarchists do not have "an
absolutely confused idea of what the proletariat must replace the
machine with." Rather, anarchists propose replacing centralized state
structures with
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federated">federated</a>
networks of "<a   href="workers&#39;_councils.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; councils">workers' councils</a>, community
assemblies, and voluntary associations coordinated through horizontal
decision-making. This is not confusion but a fundamentally different
organizational model based on direct democracy rather than
representative institutions.

**On using state power:** The anarchist rejection of using state power
reflects not naivety but historical observation. Anarchists argue that
attempting to wield state power leads to the reproduction of
hierarchical relations, as occurred in the
"<a   href="Soviet_Union.md" class="wikilink" title="Soviet Union">Soviet
Union</a> where party bureaucracy became a new ruling class. The
"<a   href="Kronstadt_rebellion.md" class="wikilink"
title="Kronstadt rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, the suppression of
the "<a   href="Makhnovshchina.md" class="wikilink"
title="Makhnovshchina">Makhnovshchina</a>, and the crushing of anarchist
movements by Marxist-Leninist states demonstrate anarchist concerns
about the dangers of concentrated power were well-founded.

## Theoretical Foundations

Anarchism's actual philosophical basis rests on several key principles
that ProleWiki either ignores or mischaracterizes:

- **Anti-authoritarianism:** Opposition to all forms of hierarchical
  domination, not just capitalist economic relations
- **Mutual aid:** Recognition of cooperation as a fundamental
  evolutionary and social force
- **Direct action:** Emphasis on autonomous struggle by oppressed
  peoples rather than delegation to representatives or parties
- **Prefigurative politics:** Building new social relations within
  revolutionary movements themselves
- **Federalism:** Organizational structures based on voluntary
  association and recallable delegation rather than centralized command

These principles emerge from materialist analysis of how power operates
in society, not from abstract idealism or petit-bourgeois ideology.

## Historical Practice

The characterization of anarchism as impractical or utopian ignores
substantial historical evidence of anarchist organizing effectiveness.
Revolutionary Catalonia demonstrated anarchist economic coordination
involving millions of people, with collectivized industries and
agriculture operating without state direction. The
"<a   href="Zapatista.md" class="wikilink" title="Zapatista">Zapatista</a>
movement in Chiapas has maintained autonomous self-governance for over
three decades. Contemporary movements from
"<a   href="Rojava.md" class="wikilink" title="Rojava">Rojava</a> to
"<a   href="Cooperation_Jackson.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cooperation Jackson">Cooperation Jackson</a> continue developing
anarchist principles in practice.

## Conclusion

ProleWiki's treatment of anarchism exemplifies how ideological
commitment can override serious engagement with opposing viewpoints.
Rather than addressing anarchist theory on its own terms, the
encyclopedia reproduces century-old polemics that mischaracterize
anarchist positions and ignore both theoretical developments and
historical evidence. While ProleWiki serves as a resource for
Marxist-Leninist perspectives, its handling of anarchism demonstrates
the limitations of approaching political theory as orthodoxy to be
defended rather than as questions to be investigated critically.
