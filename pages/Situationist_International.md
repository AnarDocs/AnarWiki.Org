The "<a   href="Wikipedia:Situationist_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Situationist International">Situationist International</a> was a
libertarian Marxist group, based primarily in France from 1957 to 1972,
that criticized the consumerist “society of the spectacle” and played a
guiding role in the May 1968 French revolt. They urged the creation of
spontaneous "situations" that would jolt people out of their ordinary
routines. Ever since, their cultural critiques have influenced
anti-authoritarian movements around the world.

The Situationists advocated that decisions be made by "rank-and-file
general assemblies, in the enterprises and the neighborhoods, whose
delegates are answerable to those assemblies alone and always subject to
recall by them."[^1]

## Origins and Analysis

The Situationists developed out of a 1950s avant-garde art group called
the Lettrist International and borrowed from them the concepts of the
dérive (wandering around a city, paying attention to one's psyche and
the surrounding geography) and detournement (modifying comics and other
popular culture artifacts in order to subvert their original meaning).
The Situationists considered such techniques to be tools for creating
“situations” that could temporarily jolt people out of their boring
everyday routines.

The Situationist Guy Debord, in his 1967 The Society of Spectacle,
argued that all social relationships had become mediated by consumerist
imagery; in other words, society had become a giant *Spectacle*.
Alienated from their real desires, people believed they needed to
consume the products and ideologies being pitched to them by the mass
media. This mind-numbing consumption, Debord wrote, “monopolizes the
majority of the time spent outside the modern production process.”[^2]

The Situationists had the goal of eliminating the separation between art
and the rest of everyday life, so that all of life could be a creative,
stimulating endeavor. In his 1967 The Revolution of Everyday Life, the
Situationist Raoul Vaneigem criticized the traditional leftists who
never focused on the possibilities for pleasure and liberation in
people's day-to-day experiences: “People who talk about revolution and
class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without
understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the
refusal of constraints, such people have corpses in their mouths.”[^3]

## Structure

The Situationists had between 10 and 20 members at any time, and in
total they had 63 members from 16 countries.[^4]

The Situationists had a formally horizontal structure. The group's
members Guy Debord and Gianfranco Sanguinetti explain that everyone had
“an equal role in decision-making.”[^5] However, they observe that the
Situationists never succeeded in reaching full egalitarianism, since the
group was “was very wrong in *not seeing and talking about* the
partially inevitable and partially circumstantial obstacles” to equal
participation.[^6]

Simon Ford claims the Situationists suffered a "lack of fit between its
anti-hierarchical" beliefs and Guy Debord's clearly disproportionate
influence in the group. Morever, Ford writes, “There remains a huge
question mark over the group's attitude toward feminist issues.”[^7]

## On the Poverty of Student Life

In November 1966, radical students at Strasbourg University took
advantage of student apathy and won the elections to take over the
campus's section of the French Student Union. They got in touch with
Mustapha Khayati, a Tuniasian Situationist, who wrote with them a
subversive pamphlet called “On the Poverty of Student Life.” The
students appropriated funds from the student union to print and
distribute ten thousand copies around campus.[^8]

The pamphlet argued that university life was just a “form of initiation”
into the Spectacle. It criticized the bureaucracy of academia as well as
students' vapid consumption of hip trends from Zen Buddhism to
existentialism. It also attacked certain students' naïve embrace of
Stalinsim. One passage argued that the most intelligent and resourceful
students only are in the university system in order to have access to
grants:

> We must add in all fairness that there do exist students of a
> tolerable intellectual level, who without difficulty dominate the
> controls designed to check the mediocre capacity demanded from the
> others. They do so for the simple reason that they have understood the
> system, and so despise it and know themselves to be its enemies. They
> are in the system for what they can get out of it--particularly
> grants.[^9]

The pamphlet spread to universities around France and inspired many of
the libertarian impulses in the May-June 1968 revolts.

## May 1968

In May and June of 1968, a wave of riots and occupations swept France
and nearly 10 million workers went on strike. The uprising enjoyed
strong popular support; on May 8, a poll by the French Institute of
Public Opinion found that four-fifths of the country sympathized with
students in Paris who had been rioting for several days.[^10] With the
influence of the Situationist International, radically
anti-authoritarian and utopian slogans appeared on walls across the
country. "Be realistic: demand the impossible." "Live without dead
time." "Boredom is counterrevolutionary." "Happiness is hanging your
landlord." "No forbidding allowed."[^11]

The economy was brought to a halt, and the conservative president
Charles de Gaulle even temporarily fled the country.[^12] However,
workers stopped short of actually reopening and self-managing the
factories they occupied, and in June the country re-elected de Gaulle.
*An Anarchist FAQ* offers the following explanation for why the revolt
failed in the short-term:

> So why did this revolt fail? Certainly not because "vanguard"
> Bolshevik parties were missing. It was infested with them.
> Fortunately, the traditional authoritarian left sects were isolated
> and outraged. Those involved in the revolt did not require a vanguard
> to tell them what to do, and the "workers' vanguards" frantically ran
> after the movement trying to catch up with it and control it.
>
> \[I\]t was the lack of independent, self-managed confederal
> organisations to co-ordinate struggle which resulted in occupations
> being isolated from each other. So divided, they fell. In addition,
> Murray Bookchin argues that *"an awareness among the workers that the
> factories had to be worked, not merely occupied or struck,"* was
> missing.[^13]

The Communist Party played a role in suppressing the revolution.
Crimethinc summarizes the conclusions of May 1968 participants Daniel
Cohn-Bendit and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit: "The Communist CGT union negotiated
a settlement with the government to get the workers back to work, and
when the workers they claimed to represent refused en masse, they
functioned as strikebreakers."[^14]
