# Anarchism in Latin America

## Overview

**Anarchism in Latin America** is a comprehensive survey by Argentine
philosopher <a href="Ángel_Cappelletti" class="wikilink"
title="Ángel Cappelletti">Ángel Cappelletti</a> (1927-1995) examining
the development and impact of
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
movements across fourteen Latin American countries from the 1860s to the
mid-twentieth century. Originally published in Spanish in 1990, the work
was translated into English by Gabriel Palmer-Fernández and published by
<a href="AK_Press" class="wikilink" title="AK Press">AK Press</a> in
2018, with an introduction by Romina Akemi and Javier Sethness-Castro.

The book serves as both a historical sketch and an encyclopedia of
primary sources, documenting manifestos, pamphlets, petitions, and
speeches that illuminate the voices of anarchist thinkers and writers
throughout the continent. Cappelletti's work aimed to fill a significant
gap in revolutionary literature, which had been dominated by
<a href="Marxist" class="wikilink" title="Marxist">Marxist</a>
historians who often minimised or ignored anarchist contributions to
Latin American social movements.

## Summary

### Origins and Characteristics

Cappelletti traces how
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">anarchism</a>
arrived in Latin America by the 1860s, initially disseminated by
European immigrants, particularly in the French Antilles, Mexico, and
the Río de la Plata region
(<a href="Argentina" class="wikilink" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>
and <a href="Uruguay" class="wikilink" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>).
Unlike its European counterparts, Latin American anarchism developed
unique forms of organisation and praxis, taking deeper root among
indigenous workers than
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> in many
areas.

The book identifies key characteristics of Latin American anarchism
including <a href="anarcho-syndicalism" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> as the predominant
form, revolutionary and anti-political syndicalism that confronted state
power directly, integration with national liberation and anti-militarist
movements, and a vibrant literary and cultural influence. The anarchist
press played a central role in disseminating ideas among the popular
classes, influencing working-class culture to embrace concepts like
solidarity, mutualism, and **autogestión** (self-management).

### Country-by-Country Analysis

The work provides detailed examination of anarchist movements across the
continent:

**Argentina** emerged as a major centre of anarchist activity,
particularly in Rosario, drawing Italian immigrants who formed groups
like El Miserable. The
<a href="Federación_Obrera_Regional_Argentina" class="wikilink"
title="Federación Obrera Regional Argentina">Federación Obrera Regional
Argentina</a> (FORA) was explicitly anarcho-communist and maintained its
anti-bureaucratic stance. The movement faced severe repression during
the "Tragic Week" of 1919 and under Uriburu's dictatorship in 1930.

**Uruguay** was notable for its openness to anarchist ideas due to
factors including belated Spanish colonisation, absence of
Counter-Reformation institutions, and significant immigration. The
<a href="Federación_Obrera_Regional_Uruguaya" class="wikilink"
title="Federación Obrera Regional Uruguaya">Federación Obrera Regional
Uruguaya</a> (FORU) was a key organisation, and the country saw the
unique phenomenon of "anarcho-Batllism."

**Mexico** saw anarchist ideas disseminated by figures like Plotino
Rhodakanaty, with the slogan "¡Tierra y Libertad!" becoming central to
the movement through Ricardo Flores Magón and the
<a href="Partido_Liberal_Mexicano" class="wikilink"
title="Partido Liberal Mexicano">Partido Liberal Mexicano</a> (PLM),
later adopted by <a href="Emiliano_Zapata" class="wikilink"
title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a>'s movement.

**Brazil** received strong anarchist influence through Italian,
Portuguese, and Spanish immigrants, leading to significant presence in
the Brazilian workers' movement until the 1920s. The Cecilia colony,
founded by Giovanni Rossi in 1890, was an important anarchist communal
experiment.

### International Solidarity

The book documents extensive cross-border organising and international
solidarity between Latin American anarchists and their counterparts in
Europe and North America. Notable examples include support for Mexican
anarchist <a href="Ricardo_Flores_Magón" class="wikilink"
title="Ricardo Flores Magón">Ricardo Flores Magón</a> from figures such
as <a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, Joe Hill, and Jack London during the
<a href="Mexican_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>.

## Critiques

The introduction by Romina Akemi and Javier Sethness-Castro highlights a
significant omission in Cappelletti's work regarding the contributions
of women to Latin American anarchism. While mentioning figures like
Argentine Virginia Bolten, the book largely overlooks others such as
Luisa Capetillo (Puerto Rico), Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza
(Mexico), and Salvadora Medina Onrubia (Argentina).

Additionally, critics note that Cappelletti treats anarchism primarily
as something imported from Europe and America, potentially sidelining
mestizo and indigenous activists and thinkers. While he acknowledges
similarities between anarchist doctrine and ancient indigenous ways of
life, such as the Andean **ayllu**, this connection is not fully
developed.

Benjamin Dangl's review in *Toward Freedom* praises the book's breadth
and use of primary sources while noting these limitations regarding
indigenous political vision and community organisation.
