In 2011, the P'urhépecha town of Cherán (in Mexico) kicked out police,
politicians, cartels, and unauthorized loggers. Since then, residents
have horizontally self-governed while protecting their community and
forest based on the principle of kuájpekurhikua, meaning "taking care of
the territory."[^1]

# Culture

The ongoing uprising aims to revitalize P'urhépecha traditions and
language[^2] and to empower all residents including women, youth,
elders, and LGBTQ individuals. In 2015, a Women's Council and Youth
Council were incorporated into the communal government.

In its own words, the Women's Council aims to improve "the quality of
life for the women of Cherán and their families. To reduce inequality,
gender-based violence, sex discrimination, and for full integration into
the community." The council organizes lectures, workshops, and
gatherings. In 2018, it established the Women's House which, according
to María de la Luz, seeks "to recover the wisdom of the grandmothers and
work with traditional medicine. We have an organic garden and soon will
form a women's cooperative."[^3]

The Youth Council organizes cultural spaces and events as well as school
workshops on topics including literature, rap, and preventing addiction.
It also works together with the town's 3 youth-run media projects: Radio
Fogata, TV Cherán, and Fogata Kejtsitani.[^4]

The Council of the Elders is a sort of moral authority for the town.
They keep alive the memory of communal traditions and revolutionary
values. They also offer advice to the councils and assemblies. The
council has to include at least one woman from each of Cherán's four
neighborhoods.

Various residents remembers told Scott Campbell that the LGBTQ community
"is viewed as an integral part of Cherán and has had members named to
positions in the government."[^5]

# Decisions

Decisions are made by consensus at the block, neighborhood, and
community assemblies. Councils don't have decision-making power but
administer the decisions made at assemblies.

At the most local level, there's the block assembly called a bonfire
even though there's no longer a physical fire. During 2011's rebellion,
residents of each block gathered around the nightly bonfire and made
group decisions. These blocks still maintain regular assemblies which
make decisions by consensus Once a week, members of the different blocks
gather for their neighborhood assembly. Each of Cherán's four
neighborhoods has a neighborhood assembly.

Occasionally, one of the neighborhoods or the Council of Elders will
convene a community assembly to make decisions involving the entire
town.

Every three years, the assemblies elect members to the town's councils.
Council members can be removed at any time, and they can't be reelected
after their term is over. Cherán's councils, which operate by consensus,
include the following:

- The Neighborhood Coordinating Council facilitates communication
  between neighborhood assemblies and the various councils.

<!-- -->

- The Local Administrative Council oversees public works, including
  lights, gardens, and waste management.

<!-- -->

- The Community Properties Council manages communal land, administers
  communal businesses, and spearheads reforestation efforts.

<!-- -->

- The Civic Affairs Council oversees education, public health, and
  cultural programs.

<!-- -->

- The Peace and Justice Council convenes communal patrols and
  remediation programs.

<!-- -->

- The Council of Elders acts as a moral authority and crafts a
  development plan and present it to the community assembly for
  consideration.

<!-- -->

- The Youth Council creates cultural spaces, events, and workshops for
  youth.

<!-- -->

- The Women's Council organizes events and projects promoting women's
  rights and communal well-being.

<!-- -->

- The Communal Treasury overlooks the town's finances.

<!-- -->

- The Main Operating Council includes all 32 members of the specialized
  councils.

The councils establish committees to help implement projects.
Altogether, the town has about three hundred government posts. They are
paid very little, and the Council of Elders are by far the state of
Michoacán's lowest-paid government officials.

Mexico's political parties are banned from the town and are not a part
of local politics.[^6]

# Economy

Cherán has 31 schools, 2 health clinics, and 1 small hospital in
addition to private doctor's offices. Various communal businesses are
coordinated by the Community Properties Council.

Most of the town's income comes from relatives who have migrated
elsewhere, mainly to the United States. The town also accepts some
funding from the Mexican government. Residents insist that they won't
take the money if there are unacceptable conditions attacked, but still
there is a desire to ultimately stop relying on state money at all.[^7]

# Environment

Cherán residents have implemented one of Mexico's most advanced
recycling programs. have built perhaps Mexico's most impressive
greenhouse. With help from the greenhouse, they've reforested half of
the community's deforested land. Community patrols confiscate chainsaws
from unauthorized loggers and make sure farmers aren't commercially
growing water-intensive avocado trees.[^8]

# Crime

The Honor and Justice Council oversees a community patrol of about 100
people in addition to Forest Protection units. Members are rotating,
inclusive of all genders, and determined by neighborhood assemblies.
Campbell reports that so-called "anti-communal conduct" is typically
resolved with "mediation, repayment for damages, community service, or
referral for rehabilitation or psychological treatment." The patrols are
not "viewed as a law enforcement formation, but rather as organized
members of the community, selected and held accountable by the
community, working to maintain the security reclaimed by the 2011
uprising."[^9]

# Revolution

On 15 April 2011, women armed with sticks and Moltov cocktails blocked a
logging truck and took five loggers hostage. They were sick of the
loggers and cartels destroying their communal forests. Townspeople
rallied to the women's defense. Police tried to rescue the hostages but
left empty-handed after clashes. The next day, residents built
barricades and established checkpoints at each of the town's five
entrances. The spontaneously horizontal decision-making structure during
the uprising would be maintained and improved in subsequent years.

There are a couple areas that residents see as priorities for fixing.
They would like to stop relying on state funding. And they would like to
stop referring major criminals to the state prosecutor.[^10]
