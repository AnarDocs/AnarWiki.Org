## Background

In November 1999, newspapers and local media outlets in Talamance
informed residents that a deal had been broken between the Costa Rican
government and US oil companies allowing them to begin drilling in the
region.

## Events

Angered by the fact that their communities had not been consulted in the
deal, and foreseeing the ecological devastation and economic
exploitation that would result from oil exploration in their region,
Talamancan residents formed the
"<a   href="Anti-Petroleum_Action_(ADELA).md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-Petroleum Action (ADELA)">"Anti-Petroleum Action (ADELA)</a>
coalition to protest the concessions. Comprised of environmentalists,
indigenous groups, indigenous rights organizations, religious groups,
community groups, farmers’ organizations, fishermen’s unions,
small-business owners, marine biologists, and eco-tourism organizations,
ADELA sought to repeal the decision of allowing oil companies to drill
in their communities. Over the next three years, a long line of
lawsuits, public debates and protest marches were lead by ADELA. The oil
company began also paying for its own media in the area, promising
well-paying jobs to poor and unemployed residents. However, ADELA
eventually won with superior numbers.

## Result

The campaign not only resulted in a ban of oil drilling in the region,
but also a total ban of future open-cut mining projects in Costa Rica.
It also demonstrated the ability of community groups, organised workers,
scientists, environmentalists and indigenous people to work together and
defeat much more powerful governments and corporations.
