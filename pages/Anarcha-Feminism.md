## Overview

**Anarcha-feminism**, also known as **anarchist feminism**,
**anarcho-feminism**, and **anarchx-feminism** is a system of analysis
which combines the principles and power analysis of
<a href="anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist theory">anarchist
theory</a> with
<a href="feminism" class="wikilink" title="feminism">feminism</a>. It
closely resembles <a href="Intersectionality" class="wikilink"
title="intersectional feminism">intersectional feminism</a>.
Anarcha-feminism generally posits that
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
and traditional
<a href="gender_role" class="wikilink" title="gender role">gender
roles</a> as manifestations of involuntary
<a href="Coercion" class="wikilink" title="coercive">coercive</a>
<a href="hierarchy" class="wikilink" title="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>
should be replaced by <a href="Decentralization" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a>
<a href="Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism)" class="wikilink"
title="free association">free association</a>. Anarcha-feminists believe
that the struggle against
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
is an essential part of
<a href="class_conflict" class="wikilink" title="class conflict">class
conflict</a> and the anarchist struggle against the
<a href="State_(polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> and
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

This synthesis manifests in three major ways:

1.  Linking patriarchy as a uniquely important form of hierarchy with a
    significantly important role in the rise of the
    <a href="State_(Polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a>,
    <a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
    and other forms of social hierarchy.
2.  Attempting to integrate anarchist critiques of hierarchy with
    mainstream feminism.
3.  Criticizing sexist tendencies within the anarchist movement.

Canadian anarcha-feminist writer
<a href="L._Susan_Brown" class="wikilink" title="L. Susan Brown">L.
Susan Brown</a> claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that
opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".[^1]

## History

### Background

<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a>
first emerged as a political current at a time when
<a href="gender_inequality" class="wikilink"
title="gender inequality">gender inequality</a> was systematically
enforced and women were excluded from public life. Their existence was
confined to the traditional
<a href="gender_roles" class="wikilink" title="gender roles">gender
roles</a> of mothers and wives, within the construct of the
<a href="nuclear_family" class="wikilink" title="nuclear family">nuclear
family</a>. In particular, working-class women were both politically and
economically disenfranchised, which drove them closer to
<a href="socialism" class="wikilink" title="socialism">socialism</a> and
<a href="Militant" class="wikilink"
title="political militancy">political militancy</a>. They began to
agitate for <a href="reproductive_rights" class="wikilink"
title="reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a> and
<a href="free_love" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>,
which formed the basis for an anarchist feminism.[^2]

The earliest proponents of anarchism were initially reluctant to
approach the subject of feminism:
<a href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> was openly
hostile to feminist demands of
<a href="gender_equality" class="wikilink"
title="gender equality">gender equality</a> and upheld traditional
<a href="family_values" class="wikilink" title="family values">family
values</a>;[^3]
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> thought that feminist goals should be subordinated to the
<a href="class_struggle" class="wikilink" title="class struggle">class
struggle</a>;[^4] and <a href="Benjamin_Tucker" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> opposed the demand of
"<a href="equal_pay_for_equal_work" class="wikilink"
title="equal pay for equal work">equal pay for equal work</a>".[^5]

It was only after <a href="Mikhail_Bakunin" class="wikilink"
title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> made the abolition of
<a href="gender_inequality" class="wikilink"
title="gender inequality">gender inequality</a> one of the aims of the
<a href="International_Alliance_of_Socialist_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="International Alliance of Socialist Democracy">International
Alliance of Socialist Democracy</a> that women's rights became a primary
concern for the anarchist movement.[^6]
<a href="Anarcho-communism" class="wikilink"
title="Anarcho-communists">Anarcho-communists</a> adopted

<a href="economic_inequality" class="wikilink"
title="economic inequality">economic inequality</a>.[^7] This

title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> critique of
<a href="Power_(social_and_political)" class="wikilink"
title="power">power</a> within the institutions of
<a href="marriage" class="wikilink" title="marriage">marriage</a> and
the nuclear family began to attract many feminists towards
anarchism.[^8]

### First Wave (1880s–1940s)

During the 1880s, a current of anarchist feminism was first developed by
the Catalan activists
<a href="Teresa_Mañé" class="wikilink" title="Teresa Mañé">Teresa
Mañé</a> and <a href="Teresa_Claramunt" class="wikilink"
title="Teresa Claramunt">Teresa Claramunt</a>.[^9] By the 1890s,
anarchist feminism had spread across the globe, brought by immigrants to
and from Europe.[^10] The anarchist press started to publish feminist
analyses on <a href="gender_equality" class="wikilink"
title="gender equality">gender equality</a> and critiques of marriage,
the nuclear family and <a href="prostitution" class="wikilink"
title="prostitution">prostitution</a>. Through
<a href="Errico_Malatesta" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>'s *La Questione Sociale*,
Teresa Mañé's pamphlets on <a href="female_education" class="wikilink"
title="female education">female education</a> and
<a href="gender_inequality" class="wikilink"
title="gender inequality">gender inequality</a> received widespread
publication.[^11]

Anarchist feminism was further taken up by the American anarchists
<a href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> and
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>,[^12] the latter of whom came to be considered a "founding
mother" of anarcha-feminism.[^13]
<a href="Lucy_Parsons" class="wikilink" title="Lucy Parsons">Lucy
Parsons</a> also established the Working Women's Union in
<a href="Chicago" class="wikilink" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and
ensured women's participation in the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> as one of its founding members.[^14] In England, the anarchist
<a href="Charlotte_Wilson" class="wikilink"
title="Charlotte Wilson">Charlotte Wilson</a> became an advocate for
"<a href="equal_pay_for_equal_work" class="wikilink"
title="equal pay for equal work">equal pay for equal work</a>" and
promoted women's education.[^15]

Anarchist women took prominent positions within the editorial boards of
magazines (such as <a href="Mother_Earth_(magazine)" class="wikilink"
title="Mother Earth">Mother Earth</a>), in the publication of books, and
as public speakers.[^16] Specifically feminist publications were also
circulated, including *Germinal*, *El Oprimido* and
*<a href="La_Voz_de_la_Mujer" class="wikilink"
title="La Voz de la Mujer">La Voz de la Mujer</a>*, in which anarchist
women defended a revolutionary form of feminism.[^17]

One of the most notable libertarian women's groups was the
<a href="Mujeres_Libres" class="wikilink" title="Mujeres Libres">Mujeres
Libres</a>, an anarchist feminist organisation that aimed for
<a href="Women&#39;s_liberation_movement" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s liberation">women's liberation</a> from their "triple
enslavement" by ignorance, exploitation and discrimination. Founded
during the <a href="Spanish_Revolution_of_1936" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Revolution of 1936">Spanish Revolution of 1936</a> by
<a href="Lucía_Sánchez_Saornil" class="wikilink"
title="Lucía Sánchez Saornil">Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a>,
<a href="Mercedes_Comaposada" class="wikilink"
title="Mercè Comaposada">Mercè Comaposada</a> and
<a href="Amparo_Poch_y_Gascón" class="wikilink"
title="Amparo Poch y Gascón">Amparo Poch y Gascón</a>, the Mujeres
Libres implemented programmes of
<a href="women&#39;s_education" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s education">women's education</a> that taught women
technical skills and increased female literacy.[^18]

### Second Wave (1960s–1980s)

By the late 1960s, <a href="second-wave_feminism" class="wikilink"
title="second-wave feminism">second-wave feminism</a> had emerged from
the <a href="New_Left" class="wikilink" title="New Left">New Left</a>,
as part of a broad wave of anti-oppression activism that included the
<a href="civil_rights_movement" class="wikilink"
title="civil rights movement">civil rights movement</a> and culminated
with the <a href="protests_of_1968" class="wikilink"
title="protests of 1968">protests of 1968</a>.[^19] During this period,
feminists rediscovered the work of first-wave anarchist feminists like
Emma Goldman and before long the
<a href="women&#39;s_liberation_movement" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s liberation movement">women's liberation movement</a>
began to reshape the anarchist movement.[^20]

Many second-wave feminists came to consider anarchism to be the
"logically consistent expression of feminism", due to its synthesis of
the struggle for individual
<a href="liberty" class="wikilink" title="liberty">liberty</a> with that
for <a href="social_equality" class="wikilink"
title="social equality">social equality</a>.[^21]
<a href="Peggy_Kornegger" class="wikilink" title="Peggy Kornegger">Peggy
Kornegger</a> claimed that feminists had already been "unconscious
anarchists in both theory and practice" and were the only activist
tendency to be "practicing what anarchism preaches".[^22]

The pervasive environment of sexism within many sections of the New Left
gave an impulse to the establishment of women's groups as part of a
strategy of <a href="feminist_separatism" class="wikilink"
title="feminist separatism">feminist separatism</a>, which led to the
coining and adoption of the term "anarcha-feminist" by anarchist
women.[^23] Second-wave anarchist feminists developed their own
<a href="affinity_groups" class="wikilink"
title="affinity groups">affinity groups</a> according to cooperative,
decentralist and federalist principles, as an alternative to both
patriarchal and structureless organisations.[^24]

### Third Wave (1990s–2000s)

The beginnings of the
<a href="anti-globalization_movement" class="wikilink"
title="anti-globalization movement">anti-globalization movement</a>
spurred the development of a new wave, with reflections on the earlier
second-wave and the influence of
<a href="postcolonial_feminism" class="wikilink"
title="postcolonial feminism">postcolonial feminism</a> leading to an
integration of <a href="identity_politics" class="wikilink"
title="identity politics">identity politics</a> into the framework of
anarchist feminism.[^25] The emergence of a third-wave of
anarcha-feminism brought with it a new focus on
<a href="intersectionality" class="wikilink"
title="intersectionality">intersectionality</a>, as anarcha-feminists
came together to address the intersecting issues of
<a href="poverty" class="wikilink" title="poverty">poverty</a>,
<a href="racism" class="wikilink" title="racism">racism</a> and
<a href="reproductive_rights" class="wikilink"
title="reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a>, among many
others.[^26]

In <a href="Bolivia" class="wikilink" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, the
<a href="Mujeres_Creando" class="wikilink"
title="Mujeres Creando">Mujeres Creando</a> carried out
<a href="direct_action" class="wikilink" title="direct action">direct
actions</a> that challenged poverty and traditional
<a href="gender_role" class="wikilink" title="gender role">gender
roles</a>.[^27] In the United States, anarcha-feminists within the
<a href="anarcho-punk" class="wikilink"
title="anarcho-punk">anarcho-punk</a> scene spurred the development of
the
<a href="Riot_grrrl" class="wikilink" title="Riot grrrl">Riot grrrl</a>
subculture.[^28]

### Fourth Wave (2012–present)

The fourth wave of feminism emerged through the development of
<a href="postfeminism" class="wikilink"
title="postfeminism">postfeminism</a>, taking concern with the
<a href="objectification" class="wikilink"
title="objectification">objectification</a> of women by market forces
and characterised by its use of
<a href="social_network" class="wikilink" title="social network">social
networking</a>.[^29] The fourth wave of anarchist feminism was
particularly influenced by
<a href="postmodern_feminism" class="wikilink"
title="postmodern feminism">postmodern feminism</a>.[^30]

In a 2017 article,
<a href="Chiara_Bottici" class="wikilink" title="Chiara Bottici">Chiara
Bottici</a> argued that anarcha-feminism has been the subject of
insufficient discussion in public debate and in academia, due in part to
a broader hostility to anarchism but also due to difficulties in
distinguishing between the tendency of anarcha-feminism and the broader
philosophy of anarchism.[^31]

## Theory

Anarcha-feminism has a diverse range of thought, but is generally
characterised by the principles of women's
<a href="autonomy" class="wikilink" title="autonomy">autonomy</a>,
<a href="free_love" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a> and
<a href="intersectionality" class="wikilink"
title="intersectionality">intersectionality</a>.[^32] Anarcha-feminists
are committed to <a href="women&#39;s_empowerment" class="wikilink"
title="women&#39;s empowerment">women's empowerment</a> in social and
political life, opposing
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
and the
<a href="state_(polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> as key
instruments of <a href="institutional_discrimination" class="wikilink"
title="institutional discrimination">institutional discrimination</a>
against women.[^33]

### Anti-authoritarianism

Anarcha-feminism expanded on the traditional anarchist principles of
<a href="anti-statism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-statism">anti-statism</a>,
<a href="anti-clericalism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-clericalism">anti-clericalism</a> and
<a href="anti-capitalism" class="wikilink"
title="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalism</a>, demonstrating their role in
<a href="institutional_discrimination" class="wikilink"
title="institutional discrimination">institutional discrimination</a>
such as <a href="sexism" class="wikilink" title="sexism">sexism</a>,
<a href="racism" class="wikilink" title="racism">racism</a> and
<a href="homophobia" class="wikilink" title="homophobia">homophobia</a>.[^34]
Anarcha-feminists see the
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
and the
<a href="state_(polity)" class="wikilink" title="state">state</a> as two
expressions of the same system of
<a href="oppression" class="wikilink" title="oppression">oppression</a>,
and concluded that the destruction of all forms of patriarchy would
necessarily include the abolition of the state.[^35]

### Free Love

Anarchist feminists have developed a non-coercive approach to
interpersonal relationships, which particularly upholds the value of
<a href="consent" class="wikilink" title="consent">consent</a>.[^36]
Anarchist feminists such as
<a href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a> and
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a> fiercely criticised the institution of
<a href="marriage" class="wikilink" title="marriage">marriage</a>, as
they considered it to be inherently oppressive towards women due to its
lack of consent.[^37]

Their critiques of marriage led them to advocate for and practice
<a href="Free_Love" class="wikilink" title="free love">free love</a>,
which they held to be a remedy to women's
<a href="social_alienation" class="wikilink"
title="social alienation">social alienation</a>.[^38] With its basis in
freely-given consent, free love provided room for women to reconstruct
their
<a href="sexuality" class="wikilink" title="sexuality">sexuality</a> in
a way that centered their own agency and autonomy.[^39]

### Intersectionality

From the inception of anarcha-feminism as a current, anarchist feminists
have engaged with other struggles that intersect with women's issues,
participating in a number of different anti-racist and anti-colonial
movements.[^40] A specifically anti-racist anarcha-feminism was
pioneered during the 1970s by
<a href="Roxanne_Dunbar-Ortiz" class="wikilink"
title="Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz">Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz</a> and her
organization
<a href="Cell_16" class="wikilink" title="Cell 16">Cell 16</a>.[^41]

Since the third-wave, intersectionality has formed one of the core
concepts of anarchist feminism, which has used it as a method to develop
a <a href="feminist_ethics" class="wikilink"
title="feminist ethics">feminist ethics</a> of
<a href="self-organization" class="wikilink"
title="self-organization">self-organization</a> against all forms of
<a href="oppression" class="wikilink" title="oppression">oppression</a>.[^42]

### Reproductive Rights

During the late 19th century, anarchist women were among the earliest to
take up the call for reproductive rights, as part of the anarchist
feminist opposition to the nuclear family. Anarchist feminists have
distributed information about and resources for birth control, for which
many were put in jail.[^43] While working as a midwife during the 1890s,
Emma Goldman became a prominent advocate of women's reproductive
rights,[^44] calling for women's rights to practice
<a href="family_planning" class="wikilink"
title="family planning">family planning</a> and publicly rallying
support for <a href="Margaret_Sanger" class="wikilink"
title="Margaret Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>.[^45]

### Sex Work

Anarcha-feminists have been at the forefront of advocacy for
<a href="sex_workers&#39;_rights" class="wikilink"
title="sex workers&#39; rights">sex workers' rights</a> since the
late-19th century, when anarchist women in Germany and France campaigned
for the <a href="decriminalisation_of_sex_work" class="wikilink"
title="decriminalisation of sex work">decriminalisation of sex work</a>.
<a href="Louise_Michel" class="wikilink" title="Louise Michel">Louise
Michel</a> blamed
<a href="capitalism" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">capitalism</a>
for creating the economic conditions that drove women towards sex work,
which she claimed could only be brought to an end by means of a
<a href="social_revolution" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">social revolution</a>.[^46] Emma Goldman also
publicly criticised sex work abolitionists for using male legal systems
to criminalise women, which she held to be a form of
<a href="class_discrimination" class="wikilink"
title="class discrimination">class discrimination</a>.[^47]
