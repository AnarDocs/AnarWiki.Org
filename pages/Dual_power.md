**Dual power** refers to a situation where autonomous institutions and
official institutions compete against each other for legitimacy and
popular allegiance. While the term was coined by
"<a   href="Vladimir_Lenin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> in 1917 to describe conditions
during the "<a   href="Russian_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="Russian Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, the underlying
concept and strategy had been articulated by anarchist and socialist
theorists decades earlier.

## Historical Origins

The strategy that would later be called dual power has deep roots in
anarchist and socialist thought. In 1851,
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> described a
vision of revolutionary transformation through building alternative
institutions:

> Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political
> institutions, out of the sight of statesmen and priests, society is
> producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a
> new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy, and the denial
> of the old politics, as well as of the old religion.[^1]

In 1905, the "<a   href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World.md" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> articulated a similar concept in their preamble, calling for
"forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the
old."[^2]

## Leninist Conception

In April 1917, Lenin used the term "dual power" to describe the unstable
situation in Russia following the
"<a   href="February_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a>, where two competing
centers of authority existed simultaneously. Lenin wrote in *Pravda*:

> What is this dual power? Alongside the Provisional Government, the
> government of bourgeoisie, another government has arisen, so far weak
> and incipient, but undoubtedly a government that actually exists and
> is growing—the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.[^3]

For Lenin and
"<a   href="Leon_Trotsky.md" class="wikilink" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon
Trotsky</a>, dual power was understood as a descriptive category rather
than a strategic program. It characterized a revolutionary moment when
the allegiance of the population was split between the existing
bourgeois state and emerging organs of workers' power, particularly the
"<a   href="soviets.md" class="wikilink" title="soviets">soviets</a> (workers'
councils), factory committees, and armed militias. Lenin and Trotsky
understood this as an inherently unstable situation that would
inevitably be resolved through confrontation, with one power
overthrowing the other.

The fundamental characteristics Lenin identified in this dual power
situation included the direct arming of workers and peasants, the
replacement of police and army with armed popular organizations, and the
direct rule of people in their local areas rather than through
bureaucratic intermediaries.[^4]

## Anarchist Criticisms of Leninist Dual Power

Anarchists have raised several fundamental criticisms of Lenin's
conception and use of dual power:

### Centralization and Party Control

Jeff Shantz argues that Lenin conceived of dual power not as genuine
popular self-governance, but as a mechanism for vanguard party control:

> Significantly, as history would show, Lenin conceived of dual power as
> a mechanism by which the vanguard party could implement and enforce
> party control over the revolution. Lenin stated famously that the
> proletariat needed state power, that a centralized organization of
> force was required to lead the mass of people in the work of
> organizing a socialist society. Rather than an aspect of
> self-determination, or popular control of the revolution, the dual
> power structures served as a means of co-optation and centralization
> via the party within the state. Towards the end of 1917, with the
> Bolsheviks in power, Lenin finally ended the already shrinking
> autonomy of the Soviets, shifting all authority in political and
> economic matters to the newly instituted Bolshevik government.[^5]

### State Power vs. Popular Power

Anarchists reject the Leninist goal of "seizing state power" even
through organs of dual power. The Bolshevik approach sought to use
workers' councils as a vehicle to establish a new state, which
anarchists view as fundamentally contradictory to the goal of a
stateless society. The historical outcome validated anarchist concerns,
as the soviets were gradually transformed from organs of workers'
self-management into rubber-stamping bodies for Bolshevik party
decisions.

## Modern Anarchist Interpretations

Since the 1990s, there has been significant debate within anarchist
movements about whether and how to use the term "dual power." This has
produced several distinct approaches:

### Alternate Institution Building

One tendency advocates building alternative institutions such as
"<a   href="workers&#39;_cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
title="workers&#39; cooperatives">workers' cooperatives</a>,
"<a   href="community_assemblies.md" class="wikilink"
title="community assemblies">community assemblies</a>,
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
networks, and other directly democratic structures. Proponents argue
these institutions can gradually expand and replace capitalist and state
institutions. This approach emphasizes:

- Building "<a   href="counter-institutions.md" class="wikilink"
  title="counter-institutions">counter-institutions</a> that meet
  people's needs outside capitalist and state systems
- Creating worker and consumer "<a   href="cooperatives.md" class="wikilink"
  title="cooperatives">cooperatives</a>
- Establishing community land trusts and housing cooperatives
- Developing alternative economic networks and time banks
- Creating spaces like infoshops, social centers, and community gardens

Critics within the anarchist movement, however, argue this approach
faces several problems. Cooperatives operating within capitalist markets
face competitive pressures that force them to compromise their
principles or remain marginal. As
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a> warned, cooperatives alone cannot transform society
without confronting property relations and state power:

> Work for us, poor creature who thinks you can improve your lot by
> co-operatives without daring to touch at the same time, property,
> taxation, and the State! Keep them up and remain their slave![^6]

### Revolutionary Organizing Approach

Another tendency emphasizes building mass movements and popular
struggles organized from below, including labor unions, tenant
organizations, anti-fascist groups, and community defense networks. This
approach sees dual power emerging through:

- Building organizations through direct relationships and
  "<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">mutual aid</a>
- Developing collective power through grassroots organizing rather than
  service provision
- Creating structures capable of confronting state and capitalist power
- Preparing for eventual revolutionary confrontation while building
  present-day capacity

This tendency distinguishes between "activism" focused on issues,
"advocacy" aimed at policy reform, and "organizing" centered on building
collective power and leadership development. The goal is not simply
creating parallel institutions, but building organizations capable of
challenging and ultimately replacing existing power structures.

### Criticisms of "Anarchist Dual Power" Terminology

Some anarchists strongly object to appropriating Leninist terminology
for anarchist strategy. Lawrence Jarach argues that the term "dual
power" is inseparable from its statist origins:

> Using the term dual power to describe Food Not Bombs, or your local
> infoshop, or even your local autonomous union, is a parody of history.
> The entire dual power discourse is concerned with government, with how
> to create and maintain a set of institutions that can pull the
> allegiance of the governed away from the existing state. Unless the
> partisans of dual power have worked out a radically different
> understanding of what power is, where its legitimacy comes from, how
> it is maintained, and how anarchists can possibly exercise it within a
> framework that is historically statist, the discussion of "anarchist
> dual power" is a mockery of the anarchist principle of being against
> government.[^7]

Matt Crossin similarly argues that genuine dual power as Lenin described
it involved armed organs of workers' power capable of actually
challenging state authority, not simply community projects or
cooperatives:

> Real dual power is inherently unstable, given it represents an active
> threat to the power of governments and capitalists. Far from
> representing the politics of classical mass-anarchism, the new
> advocates of Dual Power as a strategy are, in reality, reviving the
> old 'utopian' tradition of non-confrontational, non-revolutionary
> socialism.[^8]

## Historical Examples

While the term "dual power" is associated with the Russian Revolution,
anarchists point to various historical examples of competing centers of
popular power:

- The "<a   href="Spanish_Revolution.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Spanish Revolution">Spanish Revolution</a> (1936-1939), where
  revolutionary committees, workers' collectives, and militias coexisted
  uneasily with the Republican government
- The
  "<a   href="Paris_Commune.md" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
  Commune</a> (1871), where workers established their own governing
  structures in opposition to the French state
- The
  "<a   href="Makhnovist.md" class="wikilink" title="Makhnovist">Makhnovist</a>
  movement in Ukraine (1918-1921), which established autonomous zones
  with workers' and peasants' councils
- Various experiments in
  "<a   href="workers&#39;_self-management.md" class="wikilink"
  title="workers&#39; self-management">workers' self-management</a>
  including factory occupations and community takeovers

In these cases, periods of dual power emerged from mass struggle rather
than gradual institution-building, and were resolved through direct
confrontation with state forces.

## Contemporary Debate

The debate over dual power within anarchist circles reflects broader
strategic questions:

- Can revolutionary transformation occur gradually through expanding
  alternative institutions, or does it require confrontation with state
  and capitalist power?
- Should anarchists focus on building "counterpower" (direct opposition)
  or "counter-institutions" (alternative structures), or both equally?
- Is it useful or misleading to adopt Leninist terminology for anarchist
  strategies?
- How do anarchists build mass organizations capable of revolutionary
  transformation while maintaining anti-authoritarian principles?

Wayne Price argues that both alternate institution building and
revolutionary organizing have their place, but differ in strategic
orientation:

> How does a class or a people learn self-government? It is through
> popular struggle, fighting for demands, and opposing the people's will
> to that of the ruling minority that people learn to collectively stand
> up for themselves and to make their own decisions. They oppose their
> power to that of the capitalist class and its state in the process of
> revolution.[^9]
