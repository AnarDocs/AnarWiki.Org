      seen in Xinjiang since 2017. We can also turn to Li's 2017 paper,

      This means that birth control measures had already been strictly

    evidence provided in the documentary are: the first example is a
    photograph of Ehmetjan Qasimi wearing a badge that supposedly
    represents the ETR. Qasimi was a member of the Soviet communist
    party and a leader of the second ETR. The person interviewed says
    this symbol shouldn't appear in a textbook. the 2nd example she gave
    was a folktale about 7 Uyghur girls jumping off a cliff when trapped
    by Han Chinese soildiers \[the actual text book references
    Manchurians not Han soldiers:
    <https://twitter.com/Dave_Brophy/status/1377953515469905923?s=20>
    \]. She says this incites ethnic hatred. on the other hand, Chinese
    textbooks I grew up with are full of stories about Han "ethnic
    heroes" æ°‘æ—è‹±é›„ sacrificing their lives when there was a war
    between the Han and other ethnic groups. That's all the evidence
    given in this documentary about violence and extremism in these

    demonstrates, for the last half century or so declines in birth
    rates among developing countries almost never reach what has been
    seen in Xinjiang since 2017. We can also turn to Li's 2017 paper,

  - â€œWith the sole exception of Turpan, all prefectures and
    prefecture-level cities in Xinjiang had fertility rates below 2.0.
    This means that birth control measures had already been strictly
    implemented and "mindsets" had already "changed" in Xinjiang well
    before 2017. There is no reason to believe birth control policy in
    Xinjiang is suddenly being implemented more stringently just as a
    matter of "reasonable" family planning concerns. The goal is to
    reduce the number of Uyghurs.â€

  1920 by the first leader of Kuomintang, who is seen as a â€œForerunner

  Mongolia and Xinjiang, favorably comparing the concept to the US,
  Canada, Australia, and Argentia (Pg.10), referring to both as
  unpopulated (Pg.87), reminiscent of other colonial rhetorics, and
  advocating extensive agricultural cultivation (Pg.139-40) as well as
  iron (Pg.155), oil (Pg.157), and jade (Pg.158) mining in the region.

- Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research poll from 9-12
  September 2020 including results on Palestinain views on Xinjiang
  finding: â€œ80% of the Palestinians believe that if press reports about
  the treatment of the Uighur Muslims in China are true, Palestinians
  should condemn the Chines policy towards its Muslim community and 15%
  disagree with that. Support for condemning China in such case is a
  little higher in the West Bank (81%) compared to the Gaza Strip (77%),
  in villages (90%) compared to cities and refugee camps (79% and 68%
  respectively), and among supporters of Fatah (83%) compared to
  supporters of Hamas and third parties (77% and 76% respectively). An
  overwhelming majority of 79% indicates that it does not believe the
  statement of the Chinese government that the camps built by China to
  allegedly detain the Uighur Muslims are in fact teaching centers
  aiming at eradicating extremism; 10% believe the Chinese statement.
  Similarly, an overwhelming majority of 83% believes that world Muslims
  should express solidarity with the Uighur Muslims against the Chinese
  government while 10% disagree with that.â€

### Population, Birth-Rate, and Other Data

- China Statistical yearbook (shows: The birth-rate in Xinjiang was
  15.88% in 2017, 10.69% in 2018, and 8.14% in 2019. Almost 50% decline
  in two years, which is not mirrored in the rest of China and does nto
  follow trends anywhere in the world. The death rate went from 4.48% to
  4.56% to 4.45 in the same period. When birth-rate drops because of
  development death-rate drops too so this is not caused by development.
  Also note that Xinjiang's minority population declined from 16,544,800
  in 2017, to 14,977,200 in 2018, to 14,899,400. At the same time the
  Han population increased and so the minority percentage dropped from
  67.68% to 60.22% to 59.05%.
  <http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2020/indexeh.htm>
  - Graphs based on this data: (note the population was increasing until
    camps were formed and sterilizations started, and that the
    specifically Uyghur data cuts off at that point but the minority
    population in Xinjiang, including Uyghurs and other groups, declined
    after that point)
  - Another Chart based off the same data (comparing the drop in
    birth-rate by Province, Xinjiang is circled and demonstrates a clear
    and extreme outlier, including compared to other provinces in which
    the one child policy was only recently introduced)

<!-- -->

- Based on data from: â€œFifty Years in Xinjiang (table 2-1), The
  Statistical Yearbook of Xinjiang over the yearsâ€ (Note the incredibly
  stark drop in the last two-three years. This does not follow the
  trends of birth-rate decrease as driven by development in china or in
  general)

Source:

- Based on data from Chinaâ€™s â€œNational Statistics Yearbookâ€ (note that
  compared to the rest of china, and even compared to autonomous regions
  with high birth-rates, which have declined in recent years, the
  decline in Xinjiang is incredibly pronounced, even dropping below the
  national rate)

- Based on data from the China Health Statistical Yearbook: (Also note:
  â€œThe 2019 Yearbook contraceptive data for Xinjiang is unusual. While
  it records 1,244,886 instances of contraceptive operations (including
  89,018 IUD removalsâ€”on a side note, at 7.15%, this is a proportion far
  lower than pre-2017 averages, wherein removals made up 20-30% of all
  contraceptive operations), it is only able to account for 45.09% of
  them in its composition data (cf. 95.05% for the 2018 Yearbook, 92.04%
  for 2016, 88.26% for 2013, 87.6% for 2011). The only area with
  comparably low composition data is Tibet, which had less than 3% of
  the total operations Xinjiang did in 2019, and unlike Xinjiang,
  historically has had incomplete composition data. This is a pattern we
  might expect to see if large numbers of procedures suddenly were
  performed outside of normal clinical contexts or where data is
  otherwise suppressed. This is not definitive evidence by any means,
  but it is something we might expect to see if sterilizations were
  suddenly occurring outside of normal clinical contexts.â€)Â  Source:
