## Early Life

Voltairine De Claire was born on November 17, 1866, in
<a href="Leslie,_Michigan" class="wikilink"
title="Leslie, Michigan">Leslie, Michigan</a>.[^1] She was the third
daughter of Hector De Claire, a French-American artisan and socialist,
and Harriet De Claire, a New Englander whose family was involved in the
abolitionist movement.[^2] Her father named her after the French
philosopher
<a href="Voltaire" class="wikilink" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>.[^3]
The family moved to <a href="St._Johns,_Michigan" class="wikilink"
title="St. Johns, Michigan">St. Johns, Michigan</a> in 1867, where De
Claire grew up in extreme poverty.[^4]

De Claire developed a love of nature and a "headstrong and emotional"
personality. At age four, she was refused entry to primary school due to
her young age but taught herself to read and was admitted the following
year.[^5] She and her sister Adelaide spent much time reading poetry and
novels by British writers, particularly
<a href="Lord_Byron" class="wikilink" title="Lord Byron">Lord Byron</a>,
who strongly influenced De Claire's writing style.[^6]

In the 1870s, De Claire's father left St. Johns to seek work and never
returned.[^7] In September 1880, her father enrolled her at the convent
of Our Lady of Lake Huron in
<a href="Sarnia" class="wikilink" title="Sarnia">Sarnia</a>, Canada,
hoping to discipline her.[^8] De Claire considered her three years at
the convent a prison sentence and felt abandoned by her father.[^9]
Despite these conditions, De Claire improved her writing and music
skills, became fluent in French, and learned piano.[^10]

Her skepticism intensified and she began doubting the existence of God.
During this internal struggle, she became a freethinker like her
father.[^11] By graduation, De Claire had become a committed anti-theist
and anti-authoritarian.[^12] She later recounted that this experience
with "Ignorance and Superstition" convinced her that her own will was
supreme and laid the foundations for her conversion to anarchism.[^13]

## Political Career

### Freethought

At 17, De Claire returned to St. Johns and began tutoring in
handwriting, music, and French, moving to
<a href="Greenville,_Michigan" class="wikilink"
title="Greenville, Michigan">Greenville, Michigan</a> in late 1885.[^14]
By this time a convinced freethinker, De Claire lectured and wrote for
movement periodicals.[^15] Through atheism, she first encountered
anarchism, as both movements reject clerical and political
authority.[^16]

In 1886, she moved to <a href="Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" class="wikilink"
title="Grand Rapids, Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a> and became
editor-in-chief of the weekly freethought magazine *The Progressive
Age*.[^17] She published under the pen name "Fanny Fern" and changed her
signature from Voltairine De Claire to Voltairine de Cleyre in
1887.[^18] Her speaking tours drew hundreds, sometimes thousands of
attendees.[^19]

Her growing fame led to lecture tours for the
<a href="American_Secular_Union" class="wikilink"
title="American Secular Union">American Secular Union</a> throughout the
Midwestern and Northeastern United States.[^20] She contributed to
several freethought periodicals, including *The Truth Seeker*.
Eventually finding the freethought movement too narrow, she began
exploring other social reform movements, including women's suffrage,
socialism, and anarchism.[^21]

### Conversion to Anarchism

In December 1887, a lecture by
<a href="Clarence_Darrow" class="wikilink"
title="Clarence Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> introduced de Cleyre to
socialist programs for improving working-class conditions.[^22] She
quickly became anti-capitalist and a socialist, denouncing monopolies,
labor exploitation, and all forms of oppression.[^23] Debates with
Jewish anarchists in Pittsburgh influenced her to study anarchist
theory, particularly the
<a href="individualist_anarchism" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> of
<a href="Benjamin_Tucker" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a>'s *Liberty*.[^24]

The <a href="Haymarket_affair" class="wikilink"
title="Haymarket affair">Haymarket affair</a> accelerated her conversion
to anarchism.[^25] She immediately regretted her initial reaction of
calling for hanging the Chicago workers' rally bombing
perpetrators.[^26] Following the trial of eight organizers, she
concluded the men had been falsely accused in a show trial and
questioned whether "justice under the law" was possible.[^27] When four
were executed, they became martyrs in her eyes, and she embraced
anarchism for life.[^28]

### Philadelphia

In June 1888, de Cleyre visited <a href="Philadelphia" class="wikilink"
title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> for the first time and decided to
move there the following year, making the city her home for the next two
decades.[^29] There she met the freethinker James B. Elliott, with whom
she had a brief romantic relationship.[^30] On June 12, 1890, de Cleyre
gave birth to their son
<a href="Harry_de_Cleyre" class="wikilink" title="Harry">Harry</a>.[^31]
Her chronic condition and depressive mood made her feel physically and
emotionally incapable of raising him, so she largely stayed away from
her son.[^32]

In Philadelphia, de Cleyre began tutoring Jewish anarchist immigrants in
the English language, which provided her with a small income.[^33] She
lived in poor conditions and her work exhausted her. She took on
hundreds of Jewish students and became friends with many more.[^34]
While she taught her students the English language, de Cleyre herself
learned <a href="Yiddish" class="wikilink" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>,
eventually becoming fluent in it.[^35] She regularly read and
contributed articles to the Yiddish anarchist magazine, the
*<a href="Fraye_Arbeter_Shtime" class="wikilink"
title="Fraye Arbeter Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>*.[^36]

### Agitation and Organization

By the end of the 19th century, de Cleyre had become one of the leading
public figures of the American anarchist movement.[^37] She acted as a
link between the Jewish immigrants and American workers of Philadelphia,
and contributed several articles, poems and stories to many anarchist
publications.[^38] She delivered numerous lectures throughout the
Northeastern United States, including regular commemorations of the
<a href="Paris_Commune" class="wikilink" title="Paris Commune">Paris
Commune</a> each March and memorial meetings for the Haymarket martyrs
each May.[^39]

She was also active as a movement functionary, organizing meetings,
establishing groups and distributing literature.[^40] In 1892, she
co-founded the <a href="Ladies&#39;_Liberal_League" class="wikilink"
title="Ladies&#39; Liberal League">Ladies' Liberal League</a>, a
freethinking feminist group which organized forums on various political
subjects.[^41] She also helped establish a Radical Library that provided
an education space for Jewish anarchists in Philadelphia.[^42]

### Travels in Britain

In early 1897, she set sail for England, arriving within a week.[^43]
She stayed in
<a href="London" class="wikilink" title="London">London</a> for two
months as a guest in John and Mary Turner's house. She was introduced to
the Freedom Group, as well as the German historian
<a href="Max_Nettlau" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">Max
Nettlau</a> and the famous Russian anarchist
<a href="Peter_Kropotkin" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter
Kropotkin</a>.[^44]

In August 1897, a group of Spanish anarchists arrived in London, having
escaped the severe political repression of the
<a href="Montjuïc_trials" class="wikilink"
title="Montjuïc trials">Montjuïc trials</a>.[^45] De Cleyre greeted 28
of the Spanish refugees upon their arrival. They described to de Cleyre
the repression they had faced and showed her the scars left by their
torture.[^46] Her meetings with the Spanish anarchists inspired her to
begin learning the Spanish language and to adopt the philosophy of
<a href="anarchism_without_adjectives" class="wikilink"
title="anarchism without adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>
from <a href="Fernando_Tarrida_del_Mármol" class="wikilink"
title="Fernando Tarrida del Mármol">Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</a>.[^47]

She decided to visit
<a href="Scotland" class="wikilink" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and
quickly fell in love with the country, remarking that if she could make
a living there, she would never return to America.[^48] In September
1897, she left Glasgow and returned to London, giving a series of
lectures on anarchism and feminism before returning to America.[^49]

### Return to Activism in America

De Cleyre was reinvigorated by her time in Britain and immediately
returned to her writing and speaking engagements.[^50] She began writing
regular reports on the United States for the *Freedom* newspaper in
London, and started a translation of Jean Grave's *Moribund Society and
Anarchy*.[^51]

The group's propaganda activities began to face difficulties in the wake
of the <a href="assassination_of_William_McKinley" class="wikilink"
title="assassination of William McKinley">assassination of William
McKinley</a> by
<a href="Leon_Czolgosz" class="wikilink" title="Leon Czolgosz">Leon
Czolgosz</a>, which unleashed a wave of political repression against the
anarchist movement.[^52] Although she did not agree with his
assassination, she remarked that assassination attempts were an
occupational hazard of being a head of state.[^53] Although de Cleyre
had previously rejected violence as a pacifist, her sympathy for
Czolgosz's attack marked a turning point, as she increasingly began to
accept violent methods such as
<a href="propaganda_of_the_deed" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>.[^54]

## Later Life

### Assassination Attempt

On December 19, 1902, de Cleyre was shot three times at point blank
range by Herman Helcher, a former student who had developed an obsession
with her and harbored paranoid delusions about her actions.[^55] One
bullet embedded in her chest and two more were lodged in her back.[^56]
Although the wounds were presumed to be fatal, she recovered after a few
days.[^57]

De Cleyre refused to identify or press charges against Helcher. She
expressed empathy for his situation, due to his mental disorder and
extreme poverty, which she believed had driven him to attempt such an
act of violence.[^58] She publicly defended him and campaigned for his
release from jail.[^59]

### Health Decline and Depression

Upon her return to the United States, her health suddenly experienced a
dramatic decline; her chronic condition was finally diagnosed as an
atrophy of tissues caused by a catarrh in her nose.[^60] By early 1904,
the infection had spread causing her to temporarily experience hearing
loss and leaving her with a loud pounding noise in her ears that lasted
for the rest of her life.[^61] Before long, de Cleyre once again fell
into a depression, finding it increasingly difficult to write and
becoming apathetic towards her political beliefs.[^62]

### Support for the Mexican Revolution

Just as her depression was reaching its lowest point, the
<a href="Mexican_Revolution" class="wikilink"
title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> broke out.[^63] Her
spirits were rapidly lifted and she devoted herself to supporting the
revolution, believing that the events in Mexico were the social
revolution she had been waiting for.[^64] By July 1911, she was working
for the Magonist newspaper *<a href="Regeneración" class="wikilink"
title="Regeneración">Regeneración</a>* and established the Mexican
Liberal Defense League.[^65]

### Final Years and Death

In her later years, de Cleyre developed a strong sympathy for the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a>, which moved her closer to left-wing politics and
anti-capitalism. She abandoned her long-held pacifism, began advocating
for violent social revolution and appealed for her readers to carry out
direct action.[^66]

Despite her failing health, she over-worked herself writing letters,
giving speeches, organizing meetings and demonstrations. By April 1912,
her health broke under fatigue.[^67] On April 17, she came down with an
attack of otitis media and was moved to the St. Mary of Nazareth
Hospital, where her infection was found to have spread to her
brain.[^68] De Cleyre spent the last nine weeks of her life in pain in
her hospital bed, finally dying on June 20, 1912.[^69]

Three days later, her body was buried at the
<a href="Waldheim_Cemetery" class="wikilink"
title="Waldheim Cemetery">Waldheim Cemetery</a>, next to the tomb of the
Haymarket martyrs.[^70] Her funeral was attended by 2,000 people,
including representatives of several trade unions.[^71]

## Political Thought

### Anarchism

From an early age, de Cleyre despised authority and loved liberty; when
pressed as to why she considered herself an anarchist, she responded
"because I cannot help it".[^72] She was driven towards anarchism by the
Haymarket affair and was specifically drawn to the individualist
anarchism of Benjamin Tucker.[^73]

She considered herself to be an
<a href="anarchist_without_adjectives" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist without adjectives">anarchist without adjectives</a>,
rejecting qualifying economic labels, as she was more interested in
changing social conditions and believed that free economic
experimentation ought to be upheld.[^74] She believed that no future
anarchist society would comply with prescriptive proposals from the
present day.[^75]

### Feminism

Alongside
<a href="Emma_Goldman" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">Emma
Goldman</a>, de Cleyre was one of the main figures of anarchist feminism
at the turn of the century in the United States. They advocated for the
abolition of gender roles, which they saw as an extension of political
authority into the personal domain, and for the establishment of women's
self-determination.[^76]

De Cleyre rejected the institutions of marriage and the nuclear family,
which she saw as inherently oppressive to women, as it positioned women
as subservient to and dependent on men.[^77] She believed that the
Church and State both played central roles in the oppression of women,
with the former teaching that women are inherently inferior, while the
latter prohibited women from achieving economic independence.[^78]

### Freethought

De Cleyre was a staunch opponent of the Christian Church, influenced by
her time spent in a Catholic convent as a child, which had led her to
reject superstition, embrace freethought and advocate for the separation
of church and state.[^79] She came to believe that the "God-Idea"
presented an inherent danger to society, as it was used to suppress
liberty and women's rights.[^80]

## Legacy

De Cleyre was eulogised in *Regeneración* and *Mother Earth*.[^81] Emma
Goldman said that de Cleyre was "beautiful in her spiritual defiance and
filled with the revolt of a flaming ideal".[^82] German
anarcho-syndicalist
<a href="Rudolf_Rocker" class="wikilink" title="Rudolf Rocker">Rudolf
Rocker</a> called her "one of the most wonderful women that America has
given the world".[^83]

Already in the 1930s, Emma Goldman remarked that de Cleyre's life and
work "had little influence in America, which of course did not speak
against her. It was due to her personality as it was hard for her to get
out of her shell".[^84] Compared with other leading figures in American
anarchism, de Cleyre has received relatively little scholarly
attention.[^85] Historian
<a href="Paul_Avrich" class="wikilink" title="Paul Avrich">Paul
Avrich</a> attributed this scholarly neglect to her short life, which
ended before the major events of the early 20th century.[^86]

Paul Avrich's 1978 book
*<a href="An_American_Anarchist:_The_Life_of_Voltairine_de_Cleyre"
class="wikilink"
title="An American Anarchist: The Life of Voltairine de Cleyre">An
American Anarchist: The Life of Voltairine de Cleyre</a>* has been
credited as one of the main contributions to scholarship about de
Cleyre, who remained largely unstudied in academic circles.[^87] In 2004
and 2005, new collections of her work were published, bringing her life
and work back to public attention.[^88]
