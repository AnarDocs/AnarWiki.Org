The Yard was an "adventure playground" in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The
national magazine McCall's, which sponsored construction of the park,
described the concept:

> The idea behind THE YARD is simple — to give children their own spot
> of earth and plenty of tools and materials for digging, building and
> creating as they see fit. Instead of ready-made playground equipment,
> THE YARD is stockpiled with tools, used lumber, bricks, tiling, paint,
> nails, secondhand materials of all kinds. There’s an old railroad
> boxcar too, a 1934 jalopy and a milk truck body the youngsters turn
> into anything they like.[^1]

From Colin Ward, "<a   href="Anarchy_in_Action.md" class="wikilink"

> When The Yard was opened in Minneapolis with the aim of giving the
> children 'their own spot of earth and plenty of tools and materials
> for digging, building and creating as they see fit',
>
> > it was every child for himself. The initial stockpile of secondhand
> > lumber disappeared like ice off a hot stove. Children helped
> > themselves to all they could carry, sawed off long boards when short
> > pieces would have done. Some hoarded tools and supplies in secret
> > caches. Everybody wanted to build the biggest shack in the shortest
> > time. The workman­ship was shoddy.
> >
> > Then came the bust. There wasn't a stick of lumber left. Hijacking
> > raids were staged on half-finished shacks. Grumbling and bickering
> > broke out. A few children packed up and left.
> >
> > But on the second day of the great depression most of the youngsters
> > banded together spontaneously for a salvage drive. Tools and nails
> > came out of hiding. For over a week the youngsters made do with what
> > they had. Rugged individualists who had insisted on building alone
> > invited others to join in - and bring their supplies along. New
> > ideas popped up for joint projects. By the time a fresh supply of
> > lumber arrived a community had been born.[^2]
