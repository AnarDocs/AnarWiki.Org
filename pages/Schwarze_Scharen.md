Schwarze Scharen (Black Flocks) were an Anarchist anti-fascist militia
established in 1929 in Germany to protect meetings of the
Anarchist-Syndicalist organizations known as the Free Workers' Union of
Germany (FAUD) and the Syndicalist-Anarchist Youth. Dressed in all
black, they engaged in puppetry, music, and theater as well as
street-fighting with Nazis. Although their "ranks never exceeded the
hundreds," they became the main opposition to fascism in some towns.[^1]
