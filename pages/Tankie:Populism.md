### Notes

- Lincoln hanged Dakota people
- Ulysses S. Grant went to war with Indigenous nations, created Board of
  Indian Commissioners and expanded settlement encroachments
- FDR was an anti-communist, with a communist sympathizer as
  vice-president, and was racist towards Japanese and Black folks,
  promoted KKK to the Supreme Court and refused to make lyncing a
  federal crime
- Huey Long was a racist
- New Democratic Party supports resource extraction projects against the
  wills of land stewards and land defenders
- Otto von Bismarck introduced a lot of social programs to undermine
  revolutionaries and to halt communist or anarchist uprisings in order
  to preserve the monarchy
- Robert Borden, of the Conservative Party, introduced a lot of social
  programs for WW1 veterans after the war to deter revolutionary actions
  and to undermine Canadian communists
- Tommy Douglas, former leader of NDP, supported genocide of Indigenous
  peoples and eugenics of disabled settlers
- NDP in Manitoba has long been complicit in cultural genocide and
  separation of children from their mothers
- National parks were a creation of an anti-Indigenous racist
  progressive
- Prairie provinces in Canada were primed for revolution led by social
  democratic and Marxist parties before being hijacked by antisemitic
  right-wing populists
- Transmisia in Nordic countries
- Police brutality still exists in welfare states like Iceland and
  Sweden
- Game theory of the welfare state bends towards anti-immigrant
  attitudes
- Some of the strongest welfare states are next to impossible to
  immigrate to such as, but not limited to: discrimination against
  disabled people, often requiring specialised skilled jobs (at
  companies that discriminates against non-native speakers), having 3 to
  10 years in savings (as “unemployment funds”) or stringent
  requirements for common-law relationships and marriages (such as not
  missing a single co-paid or shared bill for 3+ years or start the
  cycle all over again) or owning properties (that working-class cannot
  afford)
- Many people calling themselves “tankies” are not actually Marxists nor
  Marxist-Leninists often just angry SocDems with weird blinkers on
  regarding capitalist countries with strong social programs
