# After the Revolution

**After the Revolution** is a 2022 speculative fiction novel by
anarchist journalist and podcaster Robert Evans, published by AK Press.
Set in 2070, roughly twenty years after a second American Civil War
fragments the United States, the novel explores themes of mutual aid,
transhumanist anarchism, resistance to fascism, and the complexities of
military culture through an explicitly anti-authoritarian lens.

## Summary

The novel takes place in what remains of Texas after the collapse of the
United States. The Republic of Texas exists as a weak libertarian rump
state unable to control its territory, which has become a battleground
for various militias and factions. The central conflict revolves around
the Free City of Austin, a secular left-wing city-state threatened by
the expansionist Heavenly Kingdom, a fundamentalist Calvinist ethnostate
that uses religious extremism and high-tech weaponry to seize territory.

The story follows three protagonists whose lives intersect during this
conflict. Manny works as a fixer, guiding journalists through war zones
and trying to earn enough to escape the chaos. When violence reaches
what he thought was safe ground, he finds himself pulled deeper into the
struggle and begins developing connections to community defense efforts.

Roland is a former U.S. Army soldier with extensive cybernetic
enhancements who has suppressed much of his memory through military
modification. His journey takes him to Rolling Fuck, a transhumanist
anarchist enclave where former soldiers and others have built a mutual
aid society based on voluntary association, collective decision-making,
and freedom from both state and religious authority. Despite its name
(chosen deliberately to reject territorial reverence), the community
takes death seriously and mourns each person lost in conflict.

Sasha is a young woman groomed and recruited into the Heavenly Kingdom
through manipulation by a "Martyr" named Alexander. Her storyline
exposes the recruitment tactics used by fascist movements to radicalize
young people, particularly how they exploit genuine desires for meaning
and community. As she discovers the reality of forced marriage, rape,
and violence behind the Kingdom's facade, she seeks escape.

The three storylines converge when Manny and Roland undertake a mission
into Heavenly Kingdom territory, where they encounter Sasha. The novel
examines how people from vastly different backgrounds might find common
cause in resisting authoritarian movements.

## Political Themes

Evans writes from lived experience with American gun culture and
military communities while maintaining an explicitly anarchist political
framework. The novel refuses the false choice between uncritical
military glorification and complete unfamiliarity with combat realities.
Many anarchists and leftists have direct experience with military
culture, firearms, and armed self-defense, and the book reflects this
reality without endorsing state militarism.

The transhumanist anarchist community of Rolling Fuck represents the
novel's most developed vision of post-state organization. The city
operates through mutual aid and collective decision-making while
maintaining serious military capabilities for self-defense. Residents
have access to extreme body modification, drugs, and sexual freedom, but
the community also practices collective grieving and takes
responsibility for the weight of killing in combat. This challenges both
the glorification of violence in conventional military fiction and the
dismissal of armed self-defense in some pacifist traditions.

The novel's depiction of state collapse and balkanization shows multiple
forms of authoritarianism emerging from the wreckage. The Heavenly
Kingdom represents theocratic fascism, while the American Federation
maintains corporate capitalism with a surveillance state apparatus. The
United Christian States imposes religious fundamentalism across the
South. Against these hierarchical systems, Evans positions both the
autonomous city-state of Austin and the explicitly anarchist Rolling
Fuck as examples of non-state resistance and organization.

The book's treatment of religious extremism and grooming draws clear
parallels to real-world recruitment by groups like ISIS. Sasha's
storyline demonstrates how fascist movements exploit genuine human needs
for community and purpose, then trap people through violence and social
control. This analysis applies equally to Christian fundamentalism as to
Islamist extremism.

## Reception

M. L. Clark's review in *Strange Horizons* praised the novel for
bridging a gap in science fiction between military realism and
progressive politics. Clark noted that the book challenges the false
assumption that familiarity with guns and military culture is
incompatible with leftist politics, stating "many leftist writers grew
up in, and continue to struggle within, the thick of US military
cultures." The review commended Evans for writing about conflict while
"performing deep familiarity with existing military cultures" without
endorsing militarism, instead centering protection of people from
authoritarian violence.[^1]

Clark particularly noted the novel's "gentle optimism" in its vision of
community formation across different backgrounds and its serious
treatment of transhumanist anarchism. The review described Rolling
Fuck's inhabitants as taking death more seriously than many contemporary
people, gathering to mark the loss of each person killed in battle
regardless of which side they fought on.

Joe Streckert wrote in the *Portland Mercury* that the book succeeds as
both action narrative and political commentary, avoiding
heavy-handedness while maintaining clear ideological perspective through
character experience.[^2]

Susan Elizabeth Shepard's review in *Texas Monthly* examined the novel's
cyberpunk elements and treatment of regional tensions, noting the
author's "underlying optimism about Texan community and adaptability in
the face of adversity."[^3]

Justine Norton-Kertson of *Solarpunk Magazine* praised the
multi-perspective storytelling and "sensitive treatment of the traumas
associated with war," noting the book's ability to provoke reflection
while maintaining narrative momentum.[^4]

## Political Geography

The novel details how the former United States fractured into competing
territories, each representing different political formations:

The **American Federation** operates as a corporate capitalist state
maintaining the appearance of the old government while serving corporate
interests. It controls the Northeast including Boston and Washington
D.C., and contests Missouri with the United Christian States.

The **Great Lakes** region, including Michigan, Wisconsin, parts of
Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, and New York, technically belongs to the
American Federation but operates with significant autonomy under
Canadian protection.

The **Blackstone Nation**, run by descendants of the Blackstone Rangers,
controls much of Illinois including the Chicago metropolitan area.

**Oklahoma** exists as a stable territory governed by an Indigenous
confederation led by the Choctaw Nation, maintaining firm borders and
relative peace through isolation from surrounding chaos.

The **Heavenly Kingdom** functions as the primary antagonist, a
Christofascist ethnostate using religious extremism to expand across the
plains and North Texas. The novel draws explicit parallels between its
tactics and those of ISIS.

The **United Christian States** controls much of the Deep South,
imposing Christian fundamentalist rule over Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

**Cascadia**, covering Oregon and Washington with claims to the Idaho
panhandle and western Montana, represents a secular nation that recently
concluded its own civil war after separating from California.

The **California Republic** maintains a stable corporate state with
social welfare programs but also extensive surveillance and police
control, its authority limited mainly to southern and coastal regions.

**Deseret**, called "Mormonland" by most characters, exists as contested
territory between mainstream LDS and fundamentalist factions,
controlling most of Utah and northeastern Nevada.

The **Navajo Nation** successfully asserted independence and maintains
effective military defense against the Kingdom of Albuquerque and
American Federation remnants.

The **Kingdom of Albuquerque** operates as a secular autocracy centered
in New Mexico, ruled through a cult of personality and using brutal
methods of control.

**Louisiana** functions as a refugee haven maintaining Catholic identity
while remaining independent from the Christian fundamentalist Deep
South.
