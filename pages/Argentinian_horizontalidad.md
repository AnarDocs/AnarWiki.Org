# Argentinian Horizontalidad

## Overview

**Argentinian Horizontalidad** (horizontalism) is a form of
<a href="direct_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="direct democracy">direct democracy</a> and
<a href="anti-authoritarian" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> organizing that
emerged during Argentina's 2001 economic crisis. The practice emphasizes
horizontal power relations,
<a href="consensus_decision-making" class="wikilink"
title="consensus decision-making">consensus decision-making</a>, and the
rejection of traditional hierarchical leadership structures.
Horizontalidad became the organizing principle for hundreds of
neighborhood assemblies, factory occupations, and social movements that
arose during the popular rebellion against neoliberal policies.

The concept represents a practical application of
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
principles, where participants build power collectively rather than
seeking to take power through traditional political channels. As one
activist described it: "We are building power, not taking it."

## History

### Origins

Horizontalidad emerged organically during the December 2001 popular
rebellion in
<a href="Argentina" class="wikilink" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>,
when millions of people took to the streets declaring "Que se vayan
todos!" (They all must go!). As people formed neighborhood assemblies
and occupied factories, they instinctively rejected the hierarchical
structures that had failed them, instead embracing horizontal forms of
organization.

The practice developed as communities sought alternatives to both the
failed neoliberal state and traditional
<a href="trade_unions" class="wikilink" title="trade unions">trade
unions</a> and political parties that attempted to co-opt the
spontaneous uprising. Participants deliberately avoided appointing
leaders, instead rotating responsibilities and ensuring all voices could
be heard in decision-making processes.

### Current Status

While the intensity of the movement decreased as Argentina's economy
stabilized, some assemblies and horizontalist practices continue to
operate. The principles of horizontalidad have influenced social
movements throughout Latin America and beyond, serving as a model for
<a href="anti-authoritarian" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> organizing. The
experiences remain in collective memory as seeds for future movements
and continue to inform grassroots organizing strategies.

## Organisation

Horizontalidad is characterized by several key organizational
principles:

**Non-hierarchical Structure**: Decisions are made collectively without
appointed leaders or representatives who can speak for others. Instead,
assemblies use rotating facilitators and spokespeople who carry
information between groups but cannot make decisions on behalf of
others.

**Consensus Process**: Groups strive for consensus rather than majority
rule, ensuring all participants have input in decisions that affect
them. When full consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be modified
to gain broader support or postponed for further discussion.

**Direct Participation**: All affected individuals are encouraged to
participate directly in decision-making rather than delegating authority
to representatives. This extends to factory occupations where workers
share managerial duties and rotate responsibilities.

**Autonomy and Coordination**: While groups maintain their autonomy,
they coordinate through non-binding assemblies and plenaries where
decisions are only implemented if participants have enthusiasm to carry
them out.

## Criticism

Critics argue that horizontalidad's rejection of formal leadership can
lead to informal hierarchies and make coordinated action difficult. Some
contend that the lack of centralized organization limits the movement's
ability to achieve systemic change or effectively challenge state power.

Traditional leftist organizations criticized the movement's rejection of
political parties and established unions, arguing this weakened the
potential for broader political transformation. However, supporters view
this as a strength that prevented co-optation and maintained the
movement's <a href="anti-authoritarian" class="wikilink"
title="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> character.

The practice has also faced violent state repression, with dozens killed
during the 2001 uprising, demonstrating the challenges horizontalist
movements face when confronting established power structures.

## Anarchy Works Excerpt

From Peter Gelderloos,
<a href="Anarchy_Works" class="wikilink" title="Anarchy Works">Anarchy
Works</a>:

In December 2001, a long-brewing economic crisis in Argentina matured
into a run on the banks which precipitated a major popular rebellion.
Argentina had been the poster child of neoliberal institutions such as
the International Monetary Fund, but the policies that enriched foreign
investors and gave middle class Argentinians a First World lifestyle
created an acute poverty for much of the country. Anti-capitalist
resistance was already widely developed among the unemployed, and after
the middle class lost all its savings, millions of people took to the
streets, rejecting all the false solutions and excuses offered by
politicians, economists, and the media, declaring instead: "Que se vayan
todos! *They all must go!*" Dozens were killed by police, but people
fought back, shaking off the terror left over from the military
dictatorship that ruled Argentina in the '70s and '80s.

Hundreds of factories abandoned by their owners were occupied by
workers, who resumed production so they could continue to feed their
families. The more radical of these worker-occupied factories equalized
wages and shared managerial duties among all workers. They made
decisions in open meetings, and some workers taught themselves tasks
such as accounting. To ensure that a new managerial class did not arise,
some factories rotated managerial tasks, or required that people in
managerial roles still work on the factory floor and perform the
accounting, marketing, and other tasks after hours. As of this writing,
several of these occupied workplaces have been able to expand their
workforce and hire additional workers from Argentina's huge unemployed
population. In some cases, occupied factories trade needed supplies and
products with one another, creating a shadow economy in a spirit of
solidarity.

One of the most famous, the Zanon ceramics factory located in southern
Argentina, was shut down by the owner in 2001 and occupied by its
workers the following January. They began running the factory with an
open assembly and commissions made up of workers to manage Sales,
Administration, Planning, Security, Hygiene and Sanitation, Purchasing,
Production, Diffusion, and Press. Following the occupation, they rehired
workers who had been fired before the closing. As of 2004, they numbered
270 workers and produced at 50% of the production rate before the
factory was closed. Bringing doctors and psychologists on site, they
provided themselves with healthcare. The workers found that they could
pay their workforce with just two days of production, so they lowered
prices 60% and organized a network of young vendors, many previously
unemployed, to market the ceramic tiles throughout the city. In addition
to producing tiles, the Zanon factory involves itself with social
movements, donating money to hospitals and schools, selling tiles at
cost to poor people, hosting films, performances, and art shows, and
carrying out solidarity actions with other struggles. They also support
the Mapuche struggle for autonomy; and when their clay supplier stopped
doing business with them for political reasons, the Mapuche began
supplying clay. As of April 2003, the factory had faced four attempted
evictions by the police, with the support of the trade unions. All were
forcefully resisted by the workers, assisted by neighbors, piqueteros,
and others.

In July 2001, the workers of the El Tigre supermarket in Rosario,
Argentina, occupied their workplace. The owner had shut it down two
months earlier and declared bankruptcy, still owing his employees months
in wages. After fruitless protesting, the workers opened El Tigre and
began running it themselves through an assembly that allowed all workers
a part in decision-making. In a spirit of solidarity they lowered prices
and began selling fruit and vegetables from a local farmers' cooperative
and products made in other occupied factories. They also used part of
their space to open a cultural center for the neighborhood, housing
political talks, student groups, theater and yoga workshops, puppet
shows, a café, and a library. In 2003, El Tigre's cultural center held
the national meeting of reclaimed businesses, attended by 1,500 people.
Maria, one collective member, said of her experience: "Three years ago,
if someone had told me we'd be able to run this place I'd never have
believed them... I believed we needed bosses to tell us what to do, now
I realize that together we can do it better than them." [^1]...

In the plethora of experiments that arose in Argentina in response to
the crisis of 2001, the economics of solidarity and care for all members
of society flourished. The economic collapse in Argentina did not lead
to the dog-eat-dog scenario that capitalists fear. Rather, the result
was an explosion of solidarity, and the elderly and disabled have not
been left out of this web of mutual aid. In participating in the
neighborhood assemblies, elderly and disabled people in Argentina got a
chance to secure their own needs and represent themselves in the
decisions that would affect their lives. At some assemblies,
participants suggested that those who own their own houses withhold
their property tax and instead give that money to the local hospital or
other care facilities. In parts of Argentina with severe unemployment,
movements of unemployed workers have effectively taken over and are
building new economies. In General Mosconi, an oil town in the north,
unemployment is above 40%, and the area is largely autonomous. The
movement has organized over 300 projects to see to people's needs,
including those of the elderly and disabled...

The 2001 popular rebellion in Argentina saw people take an unprecedented
level of control over their lives. They formed neighborhood assemblies,
took over factories and abandoned land, created barter networks,
blockaded highways to compel the government to grant relief to the
unemployed, held the streets against lethal police repression, and
forced four presidents and multiple vice presidents and economic
ministers to resign in quick succession. Through it all, they did not
appoint leadership, and most of the neighborhood assemblies rejected
political parties and trade unions trying to co-opt these spontaneous
institutions. Within the assemblies, factory occupations, and other
organizations, they practiced consensus and encouraged horizontal
organizing. In the words of one activist involved in establishing
alternative social structures in his neighborhood, where unemployment
reached 80%: "We are building power, not taking it."[^2]

People formed over 200 neighborhood assemblies in Buenos Aires alone,
involving thousands of people; according to one poll, one in three
residents of the capital had attended an assembly. People began by
meeting in their neighborhoods, often over a common meal, or *olla
popular.* Next they would occupy a space to serve as a social center —
in many cases, an abandoned bank. Soon the neighborhood assembly would
be holding weekly meetings "on community issues but also on topics such
as the external debt, war, and free trade" as well as "how they could
work together and how they saw the future." Many social centers would
eventually offer:

an info space and perhaps computers, books, and various workshops on
yoga, self defence, languages, and basic skills. Many also have
community gardens, run after school kids' clubs and adult education
classes, put on social and cultural events, cook food collectively, and
mobilise politically for themselves and in support of the piqueteros and
reclaimed factories.[^3]

The assemblies set up working groups, such as healthcare and alternative
media committees, that held additional meetings involving the people
most interested in those projects. According to visiting independent
journalists:

Some assemblies have as many as 200 people participating, others are
much smaller. One of the assemblies we attended had about 40 people
present, ranging from two mothers sitting on the sidewalk while breast
feeding, to a lawyer in a suit, to a skinny hippie in batik flares, to
an elderly taxi driver, to a dreadlocked bike messenger, to a nursing
student. It was a whole slice of Argentinean society standing in a
circle on a street corner under the orange glow of sodium lights,
passing around a brand new megaphone and discussing how to take back
control of their lives. Every now and then a car would pass by and beep
its horn in support, and this was all happening between 8 pm and
midnight on a Wednesday evening![^4]

Soon the neighborhood assemblies were coordinating at a city-wide level.
Once a week the assemblies sent spokespeople to the interbarrio plenary,
which brought together thousands of people from across the city to
propose joint projects and protest plans. At the interbarrio, decisions
were made with a majority vote, but the structure was non-coercive so
the decisions were not binding — they were only carried out if people
had the enthusiasm to carry them out. Accordingly, if a large number of
people at the interbarrio voted to abstain on a specific proposal, the
proposal was reworked so it would receive more support.

The asamblea structure quickly expanded to the provincial and national
levels. Within two months of the beginning of the uprising, the national
"Assembly of Assemblies" was calling for the government to be replaced
by the assemblies. That did not occur, but in the end the government of
Argentina was forced to make popular concessions — it announced it would
default on its international debt, an unprecedented occurrence. The
International Monetary Fund was so scared by the popular rebellion and
its worldwide support in the anti-globalization movement, and so
embarrassed by the collapse of its poster child, that it had to accept
this stunning loss. The movement in Argentina played a pivotal role in
accomplishing one of the major goals of the anti-globalization movement,
which was the defeat of the IMF and World Bank. As of this writing,
these institutions are discredited and facing bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the
Argentine economy has stabilized and much of the popular outrage has
subsided. Still, some of the assemblies that made a vital niche in the
uprising continue to operate seven years later. The next time the
conflict comes to the surface, these assemblies will remain in the
collective memory as the seeds of a future society.

Daniela describes women's leading role in the movement:

> Historically, women have been subjugated by the system, as well as by
> society, in general. Now there's a change in the movements, and women
> are more and more the protagonists. Women play a leading role in the
> movement, and really have from the beginning. They were the ones to
> first initiate the movements. The movements were born from
> women...Women made up the movement, make up the movements, and really
> are the stars. Later they brought in their husbands.[^5]
