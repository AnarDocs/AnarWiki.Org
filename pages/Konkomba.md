> The Konkomba number about 50,000 people and reside in northern Togo
> where they are chiefly grain farmers raising sorghum, millet and yams.
> They have a typically African segmentary lineage system based on
> patrilineal descent (cf, Lugbara example). Konkombaland is divided
> into several tribes each of which in turn segment into several clans.
> Each clan rarely has more than 250 members and is the basic unit
> occupying, and being identified with, a specific territory that is its
> own. Clans divide into two or more lineages. The oldest man in, a
> lineage is its head, while the clan head is the senior of all the
> several lineage heads. Mutual assistance in work occurs within the
> clan and more commonly among members of the lineage segment of the
> clan. The clan is also a church or a parish of the prevailing
> fertility religion, the members of which are responsible for major
> rituals associated with sowing and offerings to the sacred land. Not
> only is the clan defined by economic, religious and kinship functions,
> but it is the primary mechanism of social control. Within the clan,
> disputes are to be settled by mediation and no violence is tolerated.
> Disputes with individuals outside the clan require no obligatory
> arbitration and one may resort to force or threat of retaliation.
> Within the clan the elder demands observance of the rules, but he has
> no power to enforce his decisions. The power he has is of a ritual and
> moral nature rather than judicial. As the chief and oldest kinsman his
> fellow clansmen owe him a moral obligation which is reinforced by the
> fact that as the eldest he is nearest the sacred ancestors. In
> addition he is guardian of the land. Within the clan, infractions are
> dealt with by ostracising a culprit, or by assessment of fines. For
> the latter there is no means to compel payment, aside from the
> expression of disapproval by fellow clansmen and the feeling of a
> moral-ritual obligation to conform. We must appreciate, however, that
> in a small closely-knit community, in which everyone 'believes' and
> where there are no cynics or atheists, such sanctions are extremely
> powerful. As was noted with the Pygmies, the most horrendous crimes
> are not punished by men at all, so with the Konkomba, if a man kills a
> fellow clansman he would himself die. "God", say the Konkomba, "will
> not suffer to live one who has killed his brother and there is no
> ritual or medicinal protection for the fratricide" (Tait, 1950, 275).
> Tait, however, believes that murder of fellow clansmen does not
> actually occur.
>
> Aside from the elders within a clan, another man of influence is the
> diviner, who may build up a reputation which extends over a wide area.
>
> Ordinarily the relationship between clans is one of relative
> hostility, but those which are neighbours and others which may
> co-operate in ritual affairs have harmonious relations . Such groups
> do not feud, especially those with close ritual ties. Clans which
> have, or claim to have, a near kinship relation are also not supposed
> to indulge in feuds. Nevertheless, Tait reports two closely-related
> clans whose feuding with one another was so notorious that it was
> widely remembered among Konkomba 30 years later.
>
> Clans within the same tribe which engage in feud may formally end
> hostilities by negotiation and ritual burial of the arrows of war. But
> feuds between clans of different tribes are 'endless' and there appear
> to be no formal means to bring peace. Apparently, those involved might
> eventually get tired of fighting.
>
> The tribe among the Konkomba is an amorphous entity. It has a name and
> is associated with a territory in that it is the sum of the lands
> 'owned' by its several clan components. Face marks usually indicate a
> person's tribe. But tribes have no elders, ritual leaders or chiefs.
> In inter-tribal fighting, clans of the same tribe come to the aid of
> their brethren.
>
> Konkomba, in sum, exemplify a highly decentralised polity organised
> along typical segmentary lines. They represent about as clear cut a
> case of anarchy as one can find among African horticulturalists.
