# Anarchist Views on Money

## The Origins of Money: An Anarchist Analysis

The conventional economic narrative of money's origins, taught in
virtually every economics textbook, holds that money emerged naturally
from barter trade due to the "double coincidence of wants" problem.
According to this story, primitive peoples who wanted to trade goods
would face difficulties when their trading partner didn't want what they
had to offer, leading them to adopt common items as money. **David
Graeber** comprehensively demolished this myth in his landmark work
*Debt: The First 5000 Years*, demonstrating that it has no basis in
historical or anthropological evidence.[^1]

### The Barter Myth Debunked

Economists predicted that all non-monetary economies would operate
through barter, with people directly exchanging goods like chickens for
cows or arrowheads for beaver pelts. However, **anthropologist Caroline
Humphrey** concluded definitively that "no example of a barter economy,
pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from
it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has
been such a thing."[^2] Out of thousands of societies studied, the
number that operated the way economists predicted was exactly zero.

The flaw in the barter myth lies in its assumption of **spot
transactions** between neighbors. If your neighbor doesn't need your
arrowheads today, why wouldn't you simply give them to him knowing he'll
reciprocate later? Without the artificial constraint of spot trading,
there is no "double coincidence of wants" problem, and therefore no need
to invent money. What anthropologists actually observe in non-monetary
societies is a broad system of **informal credits and debts** - gift
economies where people maintain ongoing relationships of mutual
obligation rather than attempting to balance accounts after each
transaction.

### The Actual Origins: Debt, Bureaucracy, and Violence

Graeber's research reveals that money emerged from multiple sources,
none of which resembled the barter story: **Temple Bureaucracies**: The
earliest evidence of money comes from **Mesopotamian temples** around
3500-3000 BCE. These were not states but massive non-profit
organizations managing thousands of workers in agriculture,
manufacturing, and fishing. Money emerged as a unit of account to track
inputs and outputs, with fixed equivalents established between silver
(used in long-distance trade) and barley (used for worker rations). A
silver shekel was originally defined as equivalent to the monthly grain
ration for a temple worker. Markets emerged as a side-effect of these
accounting systems, and even then operated primarily on **credit**
rather than cash exchange.[^3]

**Legal Systems and Blood Money**: Money also emerged from systems of
**wergeld** and compensation for injuries. When someone killed your
brother or put out your eye, communities needed precise equivalents to
prevent blood feuds. The **Barbarian Law Codes** of medieval Europe
contained elaborate schedules assigning exact monetary values to every
possible injury and possession, despite the absence of markets where
such items could actually be bought or sold.[^4] The word "pay" itself
derives from the Latin word meaning "to pacify."

**War and Slavery**: The invention of coinage in the 7th century BCE
corresponded directly with the rise of **standing armies** and **chattel
slavery** across Eurasia. Coins were essentially a way to provision
soldiers - give them bits of precious metal, then demand the same metal
back as taxes, effectively hiring everyone in your territory to feed
your army. This period, which **Karl Jaspers** called the **Axial Age**,
also saw the emergence of major world religions that systematically
negated the moral logic of impersonal cash markets through doctrines of
charity and prohibitions on usury.

### Debt as the Wedge for Commoditization

What physical violence and war accomplish in societies without
commercial markets - dislodging people from webs of mutual obligation
and turning "the exchange of women" into actual commodity exchange -
**monetary debt** accomplishes in societies with markets. In ancient
Mesopotamia, while a man who paid traditional bridewealth couldn't
"sell" his wife, **debt default changed everything**. Creditors could
seize wives, children, and family members as debt pledges. This threat
of alienation set off catastrophic social changes, as the poorest women
could be literally bought and sold, while wealthier families responded
by increasingly sequestering their own daughters.

Commercial debt thus served as a **conceptual and practical wedge** that
transformed social relations into economic ones, allowing for the
**commoditization of labor** itself - first women's reproductive and
productive labor through marriage systems, and eventually the labor of
men through wage contracts that emerged historically from within
institutions of slavery.

## Problems with Money: The Anarchist Critique

### Money as Moral Technology and Social Control

Money functions as what Graeber called a **moral technology** - a system
that enables certain types of morality while suppressing others. The
morality of debt possesses an extraordinary power to override all other
moral considerations. People will accept arrangements they would never
tolerate under other circumstances if presented as necessary to "pay
their debts." This moral force explains how creditors can justify the
**starvation of children** on grounds that "the country took out a
loan," or how individuals can be compelled to perform degrading labor to
satisfy monetary obligations.

This **colonization of morality by debt** represents a fundamental
anarchist concern. The language of debt pervades even religious
discourse - terms like "redemption," "reckoning," and "paying one's
dues" all derive from financial metaphors. Virtually all major world
religions begin by framing morality as "paying one's debts" - to gods,
parents, ancestors, or humanity - before ultimately subverting this
framework. Yet they feel compelled to start with debt language precisely
because of its tremendous moral power in relations of domination.

### The Cycle of Virtual and Commodity Money

Graeber identified a recurring historical pattern across Eurasia:
alternating periods of **virtual credit money** and **physical commodity
money**, each corresponding to distinct social formations:

**Commodity Money Periods** are characterized by:

- Large empires and standing armies
- Chattel slavery as a significant institution
- Widespread militarism and conquest
- Difficulty implementing debt relief or usury restrictions
- Money conceived as a physical thing rather than social relation

**Virtual Credit Money Periods** are characterized by:

- Decentralized political structures
- Prohibition or severe restriction of slavery
- Bans on usury and mechanisms for debt cancellation
- Money conceived as a social convention or unit of account
- Greater possibility for protecting debtors against creditors

The period from roughly 600 BCE to 600 CE saw commodity money dominate.
The Middle Ages (600-1450 CE) saw a return to credit systems with
Islamic and Christian **prohibitions on usury**. The modern period
(1450-1971) marked another commodity money era with the return of
bullion, empires, slavery, and standing armies. Since 1971, when Nixon
ended the gold standard, we've technically returned to virtual credit
money - yet uniquely, the institutional protections for debtors that
characterized previous credit periods are **entirely absent**.

### Money and the Creation of Artificial Scarcity

Money enables the creation of **artificial scarcity** even amid
potential abundance. Because money is required for exchange, those
without it cannot access goods even when surplus exists. This allows
**poverty to exist alongside plenty** - a phenomenon that **Peter
Kropotkin** argued was both unnecessary and immoral. In a sufficiently
developed society, trying to calculate individual contributions becomes
both impossible and divisive, yet money systems require precisely such
calculations.

### The Transformation of Social Relations

Money fundamentally alters human relationships by:

- **Reducing complexity**: Money makes all things commensurate, reducing
  the rich diversity of human needs, desires, and relationships to a
  single numerical scale
- **Enabling accumulation**: Unlike gift economies where generosity
  brings prestige, money allows indefinite accumulation of power and
  privilege
- **Destroying reciprocity**: Money transactions end obligations
  cleanly, undermining the ongoing mutual indebtedness that binds
  communities together
- **Perpetuating hierarchy**: Money can be inherited and invested,
  turning temporary advantages into permanent class divisions
- **Commoditizing everything**: The existence of money creates pressure
  to assign monetary values to things previously outside the realm of
  exchange - knowledge, relationships, even human beings

### Money as State Power

The **mutualist** critique emphasizes that money's problems stem largely
from **state monopoly** over currency creation and banking.
**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon** and **Benjamin Tucker** argued that free
competition in banking and currency would eliminate these distortions.
However, **communist-anarchists** like Kropotkin contended that the
problem lies deeper - in the very existence of money as a medium of
exchange, regardless of who controls it.

## Communism as Anti-Money Ideology

### From Each According to Ability, To Each According to Need

**Communist-anarchism** fundamentally opposes money because money
presupposes **exchange** and therefore implies **scarcity** and
**private property**. The communist principle "from each according to
ability, to each according to need" explicitly rejects the notion that
individuals should receive compensation proportional to their
contribution. Instead, it proposes a system where:

- All members contribute what they can to social production
- All members freely access what they need from common stores
- No accounting of individual contributions or consumption occurs
- The goal is meeting human needs, not balancing accounts

**Peter Kropotkin** articulated this vision most fully in *The Conquest
of Bread* (1892). He argued that in a sufficiently developed society,
attempting to calculate individual contributions would be both
technically impossible and morally corrosive. A loaf of bread represents
the labor of countless people - the farmer, the miller, the baker, but
also those who made their tools, built their buildings, paved the roads,
taught them their trades, and so on infinitely into the past. Any
attempt to precisely allocate credit is therefore absurd.[^5]

### Free Access and the Gift Economy

Rather than money or exchange, communist-anarchism proposes extending
**gift economy** principles to industrial society. In gift economies
observed by anthropologists, goods circulate through voluntary giving
rather than calculated exchange. This creates ongoing relationships of
mutual obligation rather than the clean slate of monetary transactions.
The gift always creates a social bond, whereas money transaction ends
one.

Communist-anarchists envision **communal warehouses** or distribution
centers where community members would freely take what they needed. Far
from creating chaos or overconsumption, this system would:

- Eliminate the administrative costs of tracking and accounting
- Remove incentives for hoarding (why accumulate what you can freely
  access?)
- Foster genuine cooperation based on mutual aid rather than
  self-interest
- Allow people to focus on meaningful contribution rather than survival
- Reduce social anxiety about economic security

### Work in a Communist Society

The communist vision assumes that in the absence of coercion and
artificial scarcity:

- Most people **naturally desire** to contribute meaningfully to their
  communities
- The **joy of creation** and **social recognition** provide sufficient
  motivation
- Unpleasant but necessary work can be **shared equitably** or
  **mechanized**
- Much contemporary "work" is actually wasteful make-work that would
  disappear
- Voluntary association and social pressure handle free-riders better
  than monetary incentives

**Kropotkin** pointed to mutual aid among workers, peasants, and in
times of crisis as evidence that humans cooperate effectively without
monetary incentives when social conditions allow.

### The Abolition of Wages

Communist-anarchists saw **wage labor** as fundamentally incompatible
with freedom, regardless of the wage level. Even well-paid work
performed under another's direction represents a form of **slavery** -
what **Mikhail Bakunin** called "wage slavery." The problem isn't
inadequate compensation but the very principle of **subordination**
inherent in the wage relation.

Money thus functions as the **instrument of class domination**. As long
as workers must sell their labor to access means of subsistence, they
cannot be truly free. Abolishing money becomes inseparable from
abolishing capitalism, the state, and all forms of domination.

## Overview of Anarchist Perspectives on Money

Anarchist thinkers have developed three main approaches to money and
currency, ranging from reform to complete abolition:

### The Mutualist Position: Reform Money

**Pierre-Joseph Proudhon** and **Benjamin Tucker** argued that money
itself isn't the problem - the issue is the **state monopoly** on
banking and currency creation. They proposed:

- **Mutual banking** - Any group should be able to form banks and issue
  credit
- **Free currency competition** - Multiple forms of money based on
  different types of collateral
- **Labor-cost pricing** - Banking fees should only cover administrative
  costs (less than 1%)
- **Elimination of interest** - Through competition, interest rates
  would fall to near zero

Proudhon's **People's Bank** concept would have provided virtually
interest-free loans to workers, allowing them to buy their own tools
rather than renting them from capitalists. Tucker believed this would
eliminate wage slavery by giving workers access to capital.

### The Collectivist Position: Collective Ownership

**Mikhail Bakunin** focused less on money reform and more on
**collective ownership** of the means of production:

- **Worker associations** would coordinate production without
  traditional markets
- **Industrial assemblies** would harmonize production with demand using
  statistical information
- **Federations** of worker cooperatives would replace both capitalist
  markets and state planning
- Money might persist temporarily but would become less important as
  collective ownership expanded

### The Communist-Anarchist Position: Abolish Money

**Peter Kropotkin** argued for the complete **abolition of money and
wages**:

- **From each according to ability, to each according to need** - No
  exchange calculations needed
- **Free access** to all goods and services produced by society
- **Gift economy** principles extended to industrial society
- **Direct distribution** from common stores rather than market exchange

Kropotkin believed that in a sufficiently developed society, trying to
calculate individual contributions would be impossible and unnecessary.

### The American Individualist School: Alternative Currencies

**Josiah Warren** and followers developed practical experiments:

- **Labor notes** - Currency based on hours of work rather than precious
  metals
- **Time stores** - Shops where goods were priced in labor-time
- **Cost principle** - Goods sold at cost of production plus minimal
  markup

## Additional Anarchist Texts on Money and Currency

### Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865)

The first self-described anarchist and founder of mutualism. Beyond the
texts you have, look for:

- **System of Economic Contradictions** (1847) - His synthesis of
  private property and collective ownership
- **General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century** (1851) -
  Details his People's Bank proposal
- **Solution du problème social** (1849) - Program for mutual financial
  cooperation among workers
- **Organisation of Credit and Circulation** (1848) - Technical banking
  proposals

**Key Ideas:** Proudhon proposed replacing the state banking monopoly
with mutual credit banks that would provide virtually interest-free
loans. His "People's Bank" would have issued exchange notes based on
real property rather than gold, democratizing access to credit.[^6]

### Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)

Advocated complete abolition of money and wages. Essential works
include:

- **The Conquest of Bread** (1892) - His main economic work proposing
  free access to goods
- **Fields, Factories and Workshops** (1899) - Economic decentralization
  and local production
- **Mutual Aid** (1902) - Foundation for cooperative economics
- **Modern Science and Anarchism** (1903) - Scientific basis for
  anarchist economics

**Economic Vision:** Kropotkin believed money was unnecessary in a
society where production could meet everyone's needs. He argued that
trying to measure individual contributions was both impossible and
divisive.[^7]

### Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876)

Focused on collective ownership and worker control. Key works:

- **God and the State** (1871) - Economic and political critique
- **Statism and Anarchy** (1873) - Discusses worker associations and
  federations
- **The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution** (1871) -
  Economic analysis
- **Letters to a Frenchman** (1870) - Economic program

**Economic Model:** Bakunin emphasized collective labor and common
ownership of production means. He saw worker associations coordinating
through voluntary federation as replacing both capitalist markets and
state planning.[^8]

### Benjamin Tucker (1854-1939)

Leading American individualist anarchist who focused on banking reform.
Important works:

- **Instead of a Book, by a Man Too Busy to Write One** (1893) -
  Collection including extensive discussion of the "money monopoly"
- **The Anarchist View of Money** (1896) - Detailed exposition of his
  monetary theory
- **State Socialism and Anarchism** (1888) - Economic philosophy
- Various articles in **Liberty** magazine (1881-1908) - Ongoing
  economic analysis

**Monetary Theory:** Tucker identified four great monopolies: money,
land, tariffs, and patents. He argued that free banking would eliminate
interest by allowing anyone to issue currency backed by any form of
collateral.[^9]

### Errico Malatesta (1853-1932)

Italian anarchist who bridged individualist and communist positions. Key
works:

- **Anarchy** (1891) - Discusses money's role in capitalist exploitation
- **An Anarchist Programme** (1920) - Economic programme for
  post-revolutionary society
- **The Economic Question** - Analysis of economic organization
- **Between Peasants** (1884) - Economic dialogue in accessible form

**Approach:** Malatesta was flexible about economic organization,
believing different communities might choose different approaches to
money and exchange during the transition to anarchism.
