# How Do Anarchists Judge What Is Right And Wrong?

Anarchists don't get their morality from priests, politicians, or holy
books. Instead, they recognize that the sense of right and wrong comes
naturally from living in communities. When we see someone hurt a child,
we feel their pain through our imagination and sympathy - this urge to
help others and prevent suffering is the foundation of morality.
Anarchist thinkers like Peter Kropotkin observed that even animals
living in groups - from ants to birds to wolves - understand what helps
or harms their community. The moral principle that emerges is simple:
treat others as you would want to be treated in the same circumstances.
This isn't a divine command but a practical necessity for any society to
survive and thrive.

At the heart of anarchist ethics is opposition to **hierarchy** and
**domination**. Anarchists consider it wrong for anyone to have power
over others - whether that's a boss exploiting workers, a government
controlling citizens, a man dominating a woman, or any relationship
where one person commands and another must obey. This isn't just about
big political systems; it's about everyday life. Lying to someone,
deceiving them, or manipulating them are all forms of domination that
treat people as objects to be used rather than equals to cooperate with.
True morality means recognizing everyone's equal worth and refusing to
accept or create relationships based on hierarchy. When we declare
ourselves anarchists, we're saying we won't rule over others and we
won't accept being ruled ourselves.

The question of **force** and violence creates difficult debates among
anarchists. Some argue that using violence contradicts anarchist
principles because it means imposing your will on others - if we oppose
authoritarian force, how can we use it ourselves? These pacifist
anarchists believe change must come through education and building new
relationships, not through violent revolution. However, other anarchists
argue that self-defense and community defense are necessary when facing
violent oppression. They point out that governments and bosses already
use force to maintain their power, and sometimes the only way to protect
people and communities is to fight back. The key difference is between
using force to dominate others versus using it to resist domination and
defend the freedom to live without hierarchy.

Some critics argue that anarchism is naive because people are naturally
selfish and evil, and therefore we need governments and police to
control us. But anarchists turn this argument on its head: if people
really are naturally bad, why would we want to give some of them
enormous power over everyone else? Concentrating power in the hands of a
few - whether as presidents, police chiefs, or corporate bosses - just
means that the worst human impulses get amplified and protected by
authority. A truly selfish or cruel person does far more damage as a
ruler than as an ordinary member of a community. Anarchism seeks to
**disperse power** as widely as possible, so that no individual or small
group can dominate others. In communities based on mutual aid and
equality, people who act harmfully face the direct disapproval and
resistance of those around them, rather than being either crushed by
distant authorities or elevated to positions where they can abuse others
with impunity.

## Rules of Thumb for Anarchist Decisions

While anarchists reject rigid moral commandments, several practical
guidelines can help navigate ethical questions:

**The Golden (or Platinum) Rule:** Treat others as you would want to be
treated in the same circumstances. This isn't a divine command but a
recognition of equality - if I wouldn't want to be exploited, lied to,
or dominated, then I shouldn't do these things to others.

**The Anti-Hierarchy Test:** Ask yourself, "Would I accept this power
being used against me?" If you wouldn't want someone ruling over you,
deceiving you, or controlling your life, then don't seek to do it to
them. Our commitment to equality means we reject claiming rights over
others that we wouldn't grant them over us.

**The Prefigurative Principle:** Do your means reflect the ends you
seek? You cannot build a free society through authoritarian methods. The
way you organize and act today should embody the relationships and
values you want to see in the future.

**The Solidarity Question:** Does this action strengthen or weaken
mutual aid and cooperation? Actions that build community, share
resources, and flatten hierarchies move us toward freedom. Those that
create dependencies and power imbalances move us away from it.

**The Practice-Based Test:** Does this action develop virtues like
courage, compassion, wisdom, and solidarity, or does it reinforce vices
like cowardice, cruelty, and selfishness? We become what we practice, so
our actions should cultivate the qualities needed for a free society.

**The Dispersed Power Principle:** Does this concentrate or disperse
power? Be suspicious of arrangements that concentrate decision-making
and force in few hands. Seek instead to spread capability, knowledge,
and agency as widely as possible.

These aren't absolute laws but tools for reflection. Different
situations may require balancing these principles, and communities of
equals are best positioned to work through these tensions together.

## Developing Virtue Through Practice

Ultimately, anarchist morality isn't about following rigid rules but
about developing virtues through practice - courage to stand up to
bullies, compassion to share resources, wisdom to understand situations,
and solidarity with others who struggle. These qualities grow stronger
the more we practice them in our daily lives and in our movements.
Anarchists believe that as we build communities based on mutual aid,
voluntary cooperation, and equality, people naturally develop the moral
habits needed for a free society. The goal isn't moral perfection but
creating social conditions where everyone can flourish without
dominating or being dominated, where we treat each other with the
respect and care we all deserve.
