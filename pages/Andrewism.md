**Andrewism** formerly Saint Andrewism,[^1] is an
<a href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
YouTuber, writer, artist and musician from Trinidad and Tobago. He began
publishing videos in July 2020.

## Personal Life

Andrew was homeschooled and selfschooled[^2] from the age of around
7.[^3][^4] The curriculum did not accept climate change or evolution.

[^5] Due to growing up in a conservative evangelical Christian
environment, it took some time for Andrew to embrace his cultural
heritage, and learn about Trinidadian history. His first introduction to
politics came from Hunter Avallone.[^6][^7] He is now an agnostic.[^8]
He is pursuing a BA in Mass Communication.

[^9] He is a digital artist, painter, and poet. His birthday is in
March.[^10] His favourite colour is golden yellow.[^11]

## Politics

Andrew enjoys philosophy.[^12] His favourite anarchist writers include
<a href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a> and
<a href="Ashanti_Alston.md" class="wikilink" title="Ashanti Alston">Ashanti
Alston</a>,[^13] and his favourite political thinker is
<a href="bell_hooks.md" class="wikilink" title="bell hooks">bell hooks</a>.[^14]
Andrew has described his political position as post-civilization,
post-colonial, solarpunk anarchist-communist (strongly informed by Black
Anarchists)[^15] with Anarkata tendencies.[^16]

## YouTube

Andrew started YouTube after one of his blog posts got particularly
long, and he decided to make it a video.[^17] Andrew has stated that he
is not trying to appeal to the general public, and that he tries to
cover topics that are often ignored.[^18] His videos exist as an "olive
branch to the people who tend to be ignored in favour of this myth of
the "rugged white coal mining working class Trump supporter" that
everyone has to "appeal to.""[^19] He encourages viewers to dig deeper,
do their own research, and introspect.[^20] Andrew moderates comments to
remove racism and disrespect.[^21] Andrew "refuses to compromise \[his\]
most basic principles to "market \[him\]self" and grow an
audience."[^22] Some of his video scripts can be found on
<a href="The_Anarchist_Library.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Anarchist Library">The Anarchist Library</a>.[^23] The music
in his videos is produced by salmon_the_ghost.

He used the name Saint Andrew because it was his artist signature for a
bit. [^24] Saint is the closest English translation to the Japanese word
全人, which is "a person well-balanced morally and intellectually,"
which is what Andrew tries to be.[^25] In April 2022, he changed his
channel name to Andrewism.[^26]

He has described Diary of a Wimpy, Arthur, Phineas and Ferb, and Big
Nate as some of the early pillars of his sense of humour.[^27]

### Second Channel

Andrew announced his second channel, Extra Andrewism, on July 19, 2021.
He plans to publish shorter, more creative, and more experimental
content, particularly parodies that may infringe on copyright, to avoid
jeopardizing his main channel.[^28]
