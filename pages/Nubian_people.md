> The Nubians are a society of sedentary farmers in Egypt. They were
> traditionally stateless, and even according to recent accounts they
> consider it highly immoral to bring in the government to solve
> disputes. In contrast to the individualistic and legalistic ways of
> viewing disputes in authoritarian societies, the norm in Nubian
> culture is to consider one person’s problem everyone’s problem; when
> there is a dispute, strangers, friends, relatives, or other third
> parties intercede to help the disputants find a mutually satisfying
> resolution. According to anthropologist Robert Fernea, Nubian culture
> regards quarrels between members of a kinship group as dangerous, in
> that they threaten the supportive social net on which all depend.
>
> This culture of cooperation and mutual responsibility is backed up by
> economic and social structures as well. Among the Nubians, property
> such as waterwheels, cattle, and palm trees have traditionally been
> communally owned, so in the daily work of feeding themselves people
> are immersed in cooperative social bonds that teach solidarity and the
> importance of getting along. Additionally, the kinship groups which
> comprise Nubian society, called “nogs,” are interwoven, not atomized
> like the isolated nuclear families of Western society: “This means
> that a person’s nogs are overlapping and involve diverse, dispersed
> membership. This feature is very important, for the Nubian community
> does not easily split into opposing factions<em>.</em>”[^1] Most
> disputes are resolved quickly by a third relative. Larger disputes
> that embroil more people are solved in a family council with all the
> members of the nog, including women and children. The council is
> presided over by an elder kinsman, but the goal is to reach consensus
> and get the disputants to reconcile.
