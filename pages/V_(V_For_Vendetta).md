"<a   href="Alan_Moore.md" class="wikilink" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a>
and David Lloyd in 1982. V is an

"<a   href="dystopia.md" class="wikilink" title="dystopia">dystopian</a>
"<a   href="United_Kingdom.md" class="wikilink" title="United Kingdom">United
Kingdom</a>. Easily recognizable by his
"<a   href="Guy_Fawkes.md" class="wikilink" title="Guy Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>
mask, V represents one of the most prominent depictions of anarchist
philosophy and practice in popular culture.

## Background

V was created as a prisoner known as "the man in room five" at Larkhill
Resettlement Camp, one of several
"<a   href="concentration_camp.md" class="wikilink"
title="concentration camp">concentration camps</a> operated by the
fascist Norsefire government. The camps targeted
"<a   href="black_people.md" class="wikilink" title="black people">black
people</a>, "<a   href="Jews.md" class="wikilink" title="Jews">Jews</a>,
"<a   href="homosexuals.md" class="wikilink"
title="homosexuals">homosexuals</a>, political dissidents, and other
groups deemed undesirable by the regime. While imprisoned, V was
subjected to horrific medical experimentation conducted by Dr. Delia
Surridge, which paradoxically granted him enhanced physical and
intellectual capabilities.

V eventually escaped by manufacturing explosives from garden supplies,
destroying much of Larkhill in the process. He adopted the identity of
"V" and donned a Guy Fawkes mask, spending the following years building
his underground base (The Shadow Gallery) and planning his campaign
against the Norsefire regime.

## Anarchist Philosophy

### Definition of Anarchy

V articulates a clear distinction between anarchy and chaos that forms
the foundation of his political philosophy. When
"<a   href="Evey_Hammond.md" class="wikilink" title="Evey Hammond">Evey
Hammond</a> asks if the riots following his actions represent "the Land
of Do-As-You-Please," V responds: "No. This is only the land of
take-what-you-want. Anarchy means 'without leaders', not 'without
order'."[^1]

This definition aligns with classical anarchist theory, emphasizing the
abolition of hierarchical leadership while maintaining social order
through voluntary cooperation and mutual aid. V explicitly rejects the
common misconception that anarchy equates to disorder or violence for
its own sake.

### The Two Faces of Anarchy

V describes anarchy as having two complementary aspects: "Anarchy wears
two faces, both Creator and Destroyer. Thus Destroyers topple empires;
make a canvas of clean rubble where creators can then build a better
world."[^2]

This dialectical understanding reflects V's recognition that
revolutionary change requires both the demolition of oppressive
structures and the construction of liberatory alternatives. V embodies
the "Destroyer" face through his campaign of violence against the
Norsefire regime, while
"<a   href="Evey_Hammond.md" class="wikilink" title="Evey Hammond">Evey
Hammond</a>, who assumes V's identity after his death, represents the
potential "Creator" face that can build an anarchist society from the
ruins of fascism.

Significantly, V acknowledges the Destroyer must give way to the
Creator: "Away with our explosives, then! Away with our Destroyers! They
have no place within our better world."[^3] This recognition
demonstrates V's understanding that revolutionary violence is a
temporary necessity rather than a permanent feature of anarchist
practice.

### Critique of the State

V's anarchism fundamentally opposes all forms of state authority, not
merely the fascist Norsefire regime. In his confrontation with the
statue of Lady Justice atop the Old Bailey, V declares his rejection of
justice systems that serve state power rather than genuine freedom:

> "Her name is Anarchy. And she has taught me more as a mistress than
> you ever did! She has taught me that justice is meaningless without
> freedom."[^4]

This critique extends beyond fascism to challenge the very concept of
state-administered justice, arguing that true justice cannot exist
within hierarchical power structures. V's goal is not simply regime
change but the complete abolition of the state itself, making way for a
society based on voluntary association and mutual aid.

## Methods and Tactics

### Propaganda of the Deed

V employs "<a   href="propaganda_of_the_deed.md" class="wikilink"
title="propaganda of the deed">propaganda of the deed</a>—the use of
spectacular actions to inspire and educate the populace. His destruction
of the Old Bailey and later the Houses of Parliament serve both
practical and symbolic purposes. These actions physically dismantle the
infrastructure of state power while simultaneously demonstrating that
the regime's authority is neither absolute nor invincible.

V's methods include:

- Assassination of key Norsefire officials responsible for Larkhill
- Destruction of government buildings and surveillance infrastructure
- Seizure of state media to broadcast anarchist messages
- Theatrical performances that expose state crimes and hypocrisy

### Education and Radicalization

Beyond direct action, V recognizes the necessity of ideological
transformation. His relationship with Evey Hammond demonstrates his
pedagogical approach to anarchism. V subjects Evey to a harrowing
imprisonment simulation—itself ethically questionable—to break her
psychological dependence on authority and fear of death. This experience
transforms Evey from a victim of the regime into someone capable of
autonomous action and revolutionary consciousness.

V's extensive library in the Shadow Gallery, containing works of
literature, philosophy, and political theory banned by Norsefire, serves
as a repository of forbidden knowledge. His constant use of literary
quotations and cultural references represents an effort to preserve and
transmit cultural memory that the fascist state seeks to erase.

### Strategic Violence

V's use of violence represents a form of
"<a   href="Insurrectionary_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Insurrectionary Anarchism">Insurrectionary Anarchism</a>,
employing direct armed struggle against state apparatus. However, his
violence is carefully targeted at state officials and infrastructure
rather than indiscriminate terrorism. Each killing serves a specific
purpose in dismantling the regime's power structure:

- Lewis Prothero (the Voice of Fate) - Breaking the regime's ideological
  control
- Bishop Lilliman - Exposing the moral hypocrisy of state-sanctioned
  religion
- Dr. Delia Surridge - Confronting those complicit in state violence
- Destruction of surveillance systems - Eliminating the technological
  infrastructure of state control

## Theoretical Foundations

### Anarchism Without Adjectives

V's anarchism resists easy categorization within specific anarchist
tendencies. Scholar Joshua Anol suggests V's philosophy most closely
resembles "<a   href="Anarchism_Without_Adjectives.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anarchism Without Adjectives">Anarchism Without Adjectives</a>, a
tradition that embraces multiple anarchist approaches rather than
adhering to a single ideological school.[^5]

V's thought incorporates elements of:

- **"<a   href="Social_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Social Anarchism">Social Anarchism</a>** - Emphasizing mutual
  aid and voluntary cooperation as the basis for an orderly anarchist
  society
- **"<a   href="Insurrectionary_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Insurrectionary Anarchism">Insurrectionary Anarchism</a>** -
  Embracing violent rebellion as necessary for overthrowing
  authoritarian regimes
- **"<a   href="Individualist_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="Individualist Anarchism">Individualist Anarchism</a>** -
  Stressing personal autonomy and self-actualization, exemplified in his
  relationship with Evey

### Prefigurative Politics

The Shadow Gallery functions as a prefigurative space—a lived example of
anarchist principles in practice. Within this underground refuge, V
maintains an extensive cultural archive, gardens, and living space free
from state surveillance and control. This space demonstrates that
alternatives to state authority can exist and function, embodying the
society V seeks to create.

## Moral Ambiguity

Creator Alan Moore intentionally designed V as a morally ambiguous
figure rather than a straightforward hero. Moore stated: "I wanted to be
as fair about it as possible. I mean, yes, politically I'm an anarchist;
at the same time I didn't want to stick to just moral blacks and
whites."[^6]

This ambiguity manifests in several ways:

- V's use of violence, including murder, challenges readers to consider
  whether revolutionary ends justify violent means
- His torture of Evey, though intended as radical pedagogy, raises
  questions about consent and manipulation in revolutionary practice
- His aristocratic aestheticism and cultural elitism contrast with
  traditional anarchist emphasis on working-class culture

Moore described the central question of the work as: "is this guy right?
Or is he mad? What do you, the reader, think about this?"[^7] This
refusal to provide easy answers reflects an anarchist epistemology that
encourages independent critical thinking rather than accepting
authoritative pronouncements.

## Historical Context

### Thatcherism and Neo-Fascism

V for Vendetta emerged from the political climate of early 1980s Britain
under "<a   href="Margaret_Thatcher.md" class="wikilink"
title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s conservative
government. Moore explained: "There were fascist groups, the National
Front, the British National party, who were flexing their muscles and
sort of trying to make political capital out of what were fairly
depressed and jobless times."[^8]

Moore saw Thatcherism and Reaganism as representing "the friendly face
of fascism"—authoritarian policies wrapped in rhetoric about "free
market forces" and "market choice" that produced similar results to
1930s fascism.[^9] V for Vendetta served as both a warning about
creeping authoritarianism and an exploration of anarchist resistance to
such trends.

### British Radical Tradition

V deliberately invokes British traditions of resistance to authority,
from
"<a   href="Robin_Hood.md" class="wikilink" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>
to
"<a   href="Guy_Fawkes.md" class="wikilink" title="Guy Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>.
Moore noted: "The British have always had sympathy with a dashing
villain."[^10] By appropriating the Guy Fawkes iconography, V connects
his struggle to historical resistance against state oppression,
reframing Fawkes not as a religious extremist but as a symbol of
defiance against tyranny.

## Legacy and Influence

V for Vendetta has become one of the most widely recognized
representations of anarchist ideas in popular culture. The Guy Fawkes
mask has been adopted by various activist movements, most notably
"<a   href="Anonymous.md" class="wikilink" title="Anonymous">Anonymous</a> and
"<a   href="Occupy_Wall_Street.md" class="wikilink"
title="Occupy Wall Street">Occupy Wall Street</a>, as a symbol of
resistance to authority and institutional power.

However, the 2005 film adaptation significantly diluted the anarchist
content of the original work. Moore observed that the film recast the
story as "current American neo-conservatism vs. current American
liberalism. There wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could
see."[^11] The film's removal of explicit anarchist philosophy and its
softening of the fascist regime's racial ideology demonstrate the
challenges of translating radical political content into mainstream
commercial media.

## Analysis and Interpretation

### V as Independent Inventor

Scholar Taylor Andrew Loy, drawing on Thomas Hughes's framework of
technological systems, characterizes V as an "independent inventor" with
"an outsider's mentality" who achieves "dramatic breakthroughs, not
incremental improvements."[^12] V's position outside the system allows
him to identify its vulnerabilities and develop revolutionary rather
than reformist responses.

### Permanent Revolution

V's anarchism embodies what Moore, through the character of Shevek in
Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed, describes as "permanent
revolution"—the idea that revolution is not a single event but an
ongoing process of transformation. V's death and Evey's assumption of
his identity suggest that anarchist revolution requires continual
renewal rather than the establishment of a new fixed order.

### Relationship to Violence

The question of V's violence remains contested among anarchist readers
and scholars. Some view his targeted assassinations and property
destruction as justified resistance against a murderous regime,
consistent with anarchist traditions of armed struggle. Others argue
that his methods, particularly the torture of Evey, betray anarchist
principles of voluntary association and individual autonomy.

This tension reflects broader debates within anarchism about the role of
violence in revolutionary struggle and the risks of reproducing
authoritarian relations in the name of liberation.
