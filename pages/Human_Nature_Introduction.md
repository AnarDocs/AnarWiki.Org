Anarchism challenges the typical Western conception of human nature by
envisioning societies built on cooperation, mutual aid, and solidarity
between people, rather than competition and survival of the fittest.

## Aren’t people naturally selfish?

Everybody has a sense of self-interest, and the capability to act in a
selfish way at other people’s expense. But everyone also has a sense of
the needs of those around them, and we are all capable of generous and
selfless actions. Human survival depends on generosity. The next time
someone tells you a communal, anarchistic society could not work because
people are naturally selfish, tell him he should withhold food from his
children pending payment, do nothing to help his parents have a
dignified retirement, never donate to charities, and never help his
neighbors or be kind to strangers unless he receives compensation. Would
he be able to lead a fulfilling existence, taking the capitalist
philosophy to its logical conclusions? Of course not. Even after
hundreds of years of being suppressed, sharing and generosity remain
vital to human existence. You don’t have to look to radical social
movements to find examples of this. The United States may be, on a
structural level, the most selfish nation in the world — it is the
richest of “developed” countries, but has among the lowest life
expectancies because the political culture would sooner let poor people
die than give them healthcare and welfare. But even in the US it’s easy
to find institutional examples of sharing that form an important part of
the society. Libraries offer an interconnected network of millions of
free books. PTA potlucks and neighborhood barbecues bring people
together to share food and enjoy each other’s company. What examples of
sharing might develop outside the restrictive bounds of state and
capital?[^1]

## What about human nature?

If human beings are not good enough to do without authority, why should
they be trusted with it?

Or, if human nature is changeable, why should we seek to make people
obedient rather than responsible, servile rather than independent,
craven rather than courageous?

Or, if the idea is that some people will always need to be ruled, how
can we be sure that it will be the right ones ruling, since the best
people are the most hesitant to hold power and the worst people are the
most eager for it?

The existence of government and other hierarchies does not protect us;
it enables those of ill intent to do more damage than they could
otherwise. The question itself is ahistorical: hierarchies were not
invented by egalitarian societies seeking to protect themselves against
evildoers. Rather, hierarchies are the result of evildoers seizing power
and formalizing it. (Where did you think kings came from?) Any
generalization we could make about “human nature” in the resulting
conditions is sure to be skewed.[^2]
