## During the War

## After the War

When Heinrich Himmler (the main architect of the
<a href="Holocaust" class="wikilink" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>)
visited Spain in 1940, a year after Franco's victory, he claimed to have
been "shocked" by the brutality of the Falangist repression. In July
1939, the foreign minister of Fascist Italy, Galeazzo Ciano, reported of
"trials going on every day at a speed which I would call almost
summary... There are still a great number of . In Madrid alone, between
200 and 250 a day, in Barcelona 150, in Seville 80".

### Anti-Feminism

Women's and LGBT rights were lost in the new regime as
<a href="patriarchy" class="wikilink" title="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>
was violently enforced. Around 5,000 gay people were arrested and
executed in concentration camps. Divorces were made illegal and divorced
couples were forced by the state to remarry. Women now needed the
permission of their husbands to take a job or open a bank account.

Women were legally classified as minors who were under the guardianship
of their husbands, with no legal authority over their children nor equal
rights to joint property. Women were imprisoned for committing adultery;
by contrast, men who committed the same offence were not jailed.

In addition, honor hillings were legalized, where it was legal for the
head of the household to kill his wife or daughter if he felt that she
had "dishonored" him or the family name.

Women who opposed the regime faced brutal repression, being paraded
naked through the streets, being shaved and forced to ingest castor oil
so they would urinate themselves in public. Sexual harassment and rape
of dissident women was performed by police and soldiers. In many cases,
the houses and possessions of widows of republicans were confiscated by
the government, forcing many into prostitution just to survive, leading
to:

> "The increase in prostitution both benefited Francoist men who thereby
> slaked their lust and also reassured them that 'red' women were a
> fount of dirt and corruption".

### Censorship

Books, poetry, songs, plastic arts, film and theater that were critical
of the regime were all banned and anyone caught distributing it would be
arrested. Several schools of art, writing and music were banned as they
were seen as too close to communism.

### Concentration Camps

Spain had approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners who were held in 50
concentration camps or prisons. In 1933, before the war, the prisons of
Spain contained some 12,000 prisoners, just seven years later, in 1940,
just one year after the end of the civil war, 280,000 prisoners were
held in more than 500 prisons throughout the country. Often holding poor
sanitary conditions and a lack of food, causing thousands of death, with
15,000 dying alone in 1941. Many prisoners were enslaved to build damns,
highways, coal mines, prisons and canals.

In addition, horrific medical experiments were carried out in these
camps by Antonio Vallejo-Nájera, who wished to "establish the bio-psych
roots of Marxism", proposing a link between belief in leftism and
"mental retardation". Vallejo Najera also said that it was necessary to
remove the children of the Republican women from their mothers.
Thousands of children were taken from their mothers and handed over to
Francoist families. Many of the mothers were executed afterwards.

### Purges

The Francoist Dictatorship carried out extensive purges among the civil
service. Thousands of officials loyal to the Republic were expelled from
the army. Thousands of university and school teachers lost their jobs (a
quarter of all Spanish teachers). Priority for employment was always
given to Nationalist supporters, and it was necessary to have a "good
behavior" certificate from local Falangist officials and parish priests.
Furthermore, the Francoist Dictatorship encouraged tens of thousands of
Spaniards to denounce their Republican neighbours and friends.

### Repression

Julián Casanova Ruiz, nominated in 2008 among the experts in the first
judicial investigation (conducted by judge Baltasar Garzón) against the
Francoist crimes estimate 50,000 dissidents. were executed under the
dictatorship. Political parties and trade unions were forbidden except
for the government party. Hundreds of militants and supporters of the
parties and trade unions declared illegal under Francoist Spain, such as
the <a href="Spanish_Socialist_Workers&#39;_Party" class="wikilink"

including but not limited to Basque, Catalan, Galician, Asturleonese and
Aragonese had their public use forbidden, and the statutes of autonomy
of Catalonia and the Basque Country were abolished.
