From November 1987 to October 1991, Palestinians carried out the
Al-Hijara Intifada, which means the “Uprising of the Stones”. The
unarmed, popular uprising cost Israel \$2 billion and lent the
Palestinian cause a heightened international legitimacy and urgency.
During the rebellion, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
governed themselves with grassroots committees devoted to tasks such as
education, health care and agriculture. Although a formal leadership
council emerged one or two months after the intifada's start, the
majority of actions remained decentralized.[^1]

Palestinian anarchists Ahmad Nimer and Beesan Ramadan consider the
intifada an example of anarchy in action. Nimer contends, “\[W\]hat you
lived back then was a committees based society, a society divided into
smaller communities interacting between each other, to deliver what is
best to the nation, the community took care of itself, when people took
care of each other!” Ramadan explains, “People have done horizontal, or
non-hierarchical, organization all their lives. It is already there in
my culture and the way Palestinian activism has worked. During the First
Intifada, for instance, when someone's home was demolished, people would
organize to rebuild it, almost spontaneously. As a Palestinian anarchist
I look forward to going back to the roots of the First Intifada. It did
not come from a political decision. It came against the will of the
PLO.” [^2]

A group calling themselves the Unified National Command issued their
first pamphlet on January 4, 1988. Although this group became a kind of
formal leadership of the intifada, Mazin Qumsiyeh argues in *Popular
Resistance in Palestine* that the majority of decisions came from the
local committees:

> But a close reading of events shows that the relationships were much
> more complicated and there was a more democratic, bottom-up approach
> in operation. This was key to the success of the intifada. According
> to Fatah activist Hatem Abd Al-Qader Eid, activists on the ground
> provided the main push behind the avoidance of too much reference to
> armed struggle and an emphasis on nonviolent mass civilian struggle. I
> confrimed this in interviews with key activists in Beit Sahour,
> including Hazem Qumsiyeh and uad Kokaly, who explained how information
> was passed on from local activists meeting in secret committees
> through a hierarchical network to reach Faisal Al-Husseini and his
> group...But even the directions of the local 'leadership' merely
> transmitted needs and decisions taken by popular committees.[^3]

# Committees

The First Intifada's organization rested on the formation of grassroots,
decentralized committees in prisons, schools, neighborhoods, and
industries. Analysts have described these committees as being "managed
along roughly anarcho-syndicalist lines, with one vote for each
worker-member."[^4] The committees confederated into *popular
committees*, which in turn were coordinated by the Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU). The UNLU has been described as "a
democratic confederalist shadow state."[^5]

Prisoners formed committees and conducted hunger strikes to win
concessions. For eight to sixteen hours a day, prisoners would study and
discuss Palestinian history, Marxism, and other topics.[^6]

At high schools and universities, student associations organized
demonstrations and coordinated deliveries of supplies and volunteers to
refugee camps and poorer villages.[^7]

When Israel shut down Palestinian schools, education committees took
over. Women's committees provided childcare for prisoners and ensured
the boycotts didn't prevent nutritional eating. Prisoner's committees
carried out hunger strikes. Provisions committees made sure food got to
communities that most needed them. Neighborhood watch committees kept a
watch for theft and crime. There were healthcare committees, commercial
committees, transportation committees, donor committees, intellectual
committees, agricultural committees, youth committees, and more. Within
Israel, Palestinians formed committees to support the struggle in the
West Bank and Gaza. On January 24, 1988, over 60,000 Palestinian
citizens of Israel demonstrated in Nazareth. [^8]

Palestinians went on strike, refused to pay fines, and refused to close
their shops. In 1988, the West Bank town of Beit Sahour decided to stop
paying taxes to Israel. Israel's defense minister Yitzhak Rabin
responded, “We will not let this kind of civil disobedience succeed,"
and Israel put the whole town under curfew for over a month, from 5 pm
to 5 am each day. During the first four days, Israel imposed a 24-hour
curfew.[^9]

Palestinian violence mainly involved throwing rocks. The Israeli
historian Benny Morris writes, “It was not an armed rebellion but a
massive, persistent campaign of civil resistance, with strikes and
commercial shutdowns, accompanied by violent (though unarmed)
demonstrations against the occupying forces. The stone and,
occasionally, the Molotov cocktail and knife were its symbols, not guns
and bombs.”[^10] Nonetheless, Israel responded brutally to Palestinian
resistance, even expelling the Palestinian pacifist leader Mubarak
Awad.[^11]

Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered “force, might, and
beatings.”[^12] Israeli soldiers also regularly opened fire on
demonstrators.

Israeli forces killed some 1,095 Palestinians during the Intifada. In
February 1988, soldiers tried to bury four Palestinians alive, but were
stopped. That same month, a CBS crew filmed four soldiers beating up two
Palestinian youths for fifteen minutes near Nablus. Israel used
collective punishment, such as demolishing houses and cutting off towns'
electricity. During the uprising, Israel deported 66 Palestinians.[^13]

# International Intifada

The Palestinian Intifada inspired revolts across the Middle East and
beyond, including an 1988 strike in Algeria, Venezeula's *caracazo*, and
riots in Jordan, Trinidad, and Morocco. Midnight Notes calls these
revolts an "International Intifada" and claims the Gulf War was the
ruling class's response, a "forcible and violent decomposition of the
working class."[^14]
