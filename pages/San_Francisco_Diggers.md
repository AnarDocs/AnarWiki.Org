In 1966, a group of writers, actors and theorists splintered out of a
mime troupe and formed an anti-authoritarian collective named after the
<a href="Diggers.md" class="wikilink" title="Diggers">Diggers</a> of the
seventeenth-century English Revolution. With an emphasis on theatrical
direct action, the San Francisco Diggers pioneered tactics such as
radical puppetry and free stores. They printed the first issues of the
<a href="Anarchy_and_the_Black_Panther_Party.md" class="wikilink"
title="Black Panthers">Black Panthers</a>' newspaper, and their free
grocery service inspired the Panthers' famous Free Breakfast for
Children Program.[^1]

The San Francisco Diggers took inspiration from the Dutch anarchist
group Provos. Historian Andrew Cornell notes, "Like their Dutch
contemporaries, the San Francisco Diggers believed rebellious youth,
specifically those congregating in growing numbers on Haight Street,
might serve as a revolutionary 'base'. And like the Situationists and
the Provos, the Diggers devised interventions in daily life that would
challenge cultural preoccupations with status and accumulation. Digger
Peter Berg termed these interventions 'life-acting'."[^2]

The S.F. Diggers opened a store called Trip Without a Ticket, where
everything was free of charge. They served free food every afternoon at
Golden Gate Park, and they organized street theatre demonstrations with
giant puppets and other props in the middle of city streets. One member
Peter Coyote remarked, "Our hope was that if we were imaginative enough
in creating social paradigms as free men and women, the example would be
infectious and might produce self-directed (as opposed to coerced or
manipulated) social change."[^3]

The S.F. Diggers set up a printing press which printed the first issues
of the Black Panther Party's newsletter. Also, the Panther leader "David
Hillard credits the Diggers' free grocery service as inspiring the
Panthers' free breakfast program for children."[^4]

In addition to receiving donations from the Grateful Dead and other
donors, the S.F. Diggers raised funds through theft and welfare
checks.[^5]

According to Wikipedia, prevalent sexism in S.F. Diggers effectively
meant that men held a monopoly on decision making and women did most of
the actual work. "For instance, in providing free food, male members of
the group socialized and promoted the events, while female group members
did most of the work of collecting food, cooking and serving it."[^6]
