# Anti-fascism

**Anti-fascism** is opposition to
<a href="Fascism" class="wikilink" title="fascist">fascist</a>
ideologies, groups and individuals. The anti-fascist movement began in a
few European countries in the 1920s, and eventually spread to other
countries around the world. It was at its most significant shortly
before and during
<a href="World_War_II" class="wikilink" title="World War II">World War
II</a>, where the fascist Axis powers were opposed by many countries
forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements
worldwide. After World War II, anti-fascism has become an official
policy of many states and numerous decentralized militant groups
continue to fight fascism around the world. Anti-fascism has been an
element of movements holding many different political positions,
including <a href="Social_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="social democratic">social democratic</a>, nationalist,
<a href="Liberalism" class="wikilink" title="liberal">liberal</a>,
conservative, communist,
<a href="Marxism" class="wikilink" title="marxist">marxist</a>,
<a href="Trade_Union" class="wikilink" title="trade unionist">trade

<a href="Anarchism" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>,
socialist, and centrist viewpoints.

## History

Anti-fascism has its origins in black resistance to the
<a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" class="wikilink" title="KKK">KKK</a> in the
<a href="United_States_of_America" class="wikilink" title="USA">USA</a>

<a href="Dreyfus_Affair" class="wikilink" title="Dreyfus Affair">Dreyfus
Affair</a> in
<a href="France" class="wikilink" title="France">France</a>. The first
militant anti-fascist organisation emerged in 1921 in Italy, known as
the <a href="Arditi_Del_Popolo" class="wikilink"
title="Arditi del Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>, who engaged in
gunfights with fascists and violently broke up fascist meetings.

for its use by the <a href="Italian_Fascists" class="wikilink"
title="Italian Fascists">Italian Fascists</a> and the German
<a href="Nazism" class="wikilink" title="Nazis">Nazis</a>, became
prominent beginning in the 1910s. Organization against fascism began
around 1920. Fascism became the state ideology of Italy in 1922 and of
Germany in 1933, spurring a large increase in anti-fascist action,
including <a href="German_resistance_to_Nazism" class="wikilink"
title="German resistance to Nazism">German resistance to Nazism</a> and
the <a href="Italian_resistance_movement" class="wikilink"

Anti-fascism was a major aspect of the
<a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, which foreshadowed
World War II.

With the development and spread of Italian Fascism, the
<a href="National_Fascist_Party" class="wikilink"
title="National Fascist Party">National Fascist Party</a>'s ideology was
met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and
socialists. Organizations such as
*<a href="Arditi_del_Popolo" class="wikilink"
title="Arditi del Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>*[^1] and the
<a href="Italian_Anarchist_Union" class="wikilink"
title="Italian Anarchist Union">Italian Anarchist Union</a> emerged
between 1919 and 1921, to combat the nationalist and fascist surge of
the post-World War I period.

## Early History

### Germany: Against the NSDAP and Nazism

The specific term anti-fascism was primarily used by the
<a href="Communist_Party_of_Germany" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party of Germany">Communist Party of Germany</a> (KPD),
which held the view that it was the only anti-fascist party in Germany.
The KPD formed several explicitly anti-fascist groups such as
*<a href="Roter_Frontkämpferbund" class="wikilink"
title="Roter Frontkämpferbund">Roter Frontkämpferbund</a>* (formed in
1924 and banned by the
<a href="Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany" class="wikilink"
title="Social Democrats">Social Democrats</a> in 1929) and *Kampfbund
gegen den Faschismus*. At its height, *Roter Frontkämpferbund* had over
100,000 members. In 1932, the KPD established the
<a href="Antifaschistische_Aktion" class="wikilink"
title="Antifaschistische Aktion">Antifaschistische Aktion</a> as a "red
united front under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the
KPD".

The movement of
<a href="Nazism" class="wikilink" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> was opposed
for different ideological reasons by a wide variety of groups, including
groups which also opposed each other, such as social democrats,
centrists, conservatives and communists. The SPD and centrists formed
*<a href="Reichsbanner_Schwarz-Rot-Gold" class="wikilink"
title="Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold">Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold</a>*
in 1924 to defend <a href="liberal_democracy" class="wikilink"
title="liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> against both the Nazi
Party and the KPD. Later, mainly SPD members formed the
<a href="Iron_Front" class="wikilink" title="Iron Front">Iron Front</a>
which opposed the same groups.

### Italy: Against Fascism and Mussolini

In Italy, Mussolini's
<a href="Italian_Fascism" class="wikilink" title="Fascist">Fascist</a>
regime used the term *anti-fascist* to describe its opponents. After the
<a href="Italian_Socialist_Party" class="wikilink"
title="Italian Socialist Party">Italian Socialist Party</a> (PSI) signed
a <a href="Pact_of_Pacification" class="wikilink"
title="pacification pact">pacification pact</a> with Mussolini and his
<a href="Fasci_Italiani_di_Combattimento" class="wikilink"
title="Fasces of Combat">Fasces of Combat</a>, members of the workers'
movement who disagreed with this strategy formed
*<a href="Arditi_del_Popolo" class="wikilink"
title="Arditi del Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>*.

The <a href="Italian_General_Confederation_of_Labour" class="wikilink"
title="Italian General Confederation of Labour">Italian General
Confederation of Labour</a> (CGL) and the PSI refused to officially
recognize the anti-fascist militia and maintained a non-violent,
legalist strategy, while the
<a href="Communist_Party_of_Italy" class="wikilink"
title="Communist Party of Italy">Communist Party of Italy</a> (PCd'I)
ordered its members to quit the organization.

<a href="Concentrazione_Antifascista_Italiana" class="wikilink"
title="Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana">Concentrazione Antifascista
Italiana</a> (Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration), officially known as
Concentrazione d'Azione Antifascista (Anti-Fascist Action
Concentration), was an Italian coalition of Anti-Fascist groups which
existed from 1927 to 1934. Founded in
<a href="Nérac" class="wikilink" title="Nérac">Nérac</a>, France, by
expatriate Italians, the CAI was an alliance of non-communist
anti-fascist forces trying to promote and to coordinate expatriate
actions to fight fascism in Italy.

<a href="Giustizia_e_Libertà" class="wikilink"
title="Giustizia e Libertà">Giustizia e Libertà</a> (Justice and

### Spain: Civil War Against the Nationalists

The historian
<a href="Eric_Hobsbawm" class="wikilink" title="Eric Hobsbawm">Eric
Hobsbawm</a> wrote: "The <a href="Spanish_Civil_War" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish civil war">Spanish civil war</a> was both at the centre
and on the margin of the era of anti-fascism. It was central, since it
was immediately seen as a European war between fascism and anti-fascism,
almost as the first battle in the coming world war".[^2]

## World War II

During World War II, anti-fascism largely took the form of
<a href="Partisan_(military)" class="wikilink"
title="partisan">partisan</a> or
<a href="Resistance_during_World_War_II" class="wikilink"
title="resistance">resistance</a> movements. Anti-fascist movements
emerged first in Italy during the rise of
<a href="Benito_Mussolini" class="wikilink"
title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, but they soon spread to
other European countries and then globally.

Many cities in Italy, including

### France: Against Action Française and Vichy

In the 1920s and 1930s in the
<a href="French_Third_Republic" class="wikilink"
title="French Third Republic">French Third Republic</a>, anti-fascists
confronted aggressive <a href="far-right_politics" class="wikilink"
title="far-right">far-right</a> groups such as the
<a href="Action_Française" class="wikilink"
title="Action Française">Action Française</a> movement. After fascism
triumphed via invasion, the French Resistance fought against the

### United States

Anti-fascist Italian expatriates in the United States founded the
<a href="Mazzini_Society" class="wikilink"
title="Mazzini Society">Mazzini Society</a> in
<a href="Northampton,_Massachusetts" class="wikilink"
title="Northampton, Massachusetts">Northampton, Massachusetts</a>, in
September 1939 to work toward ending Fascist rule in Italy. During the
<a href="McCarthyism" class="wikilink" title="Second Red Scare">Second
Red Scare</a> which occurred in the United States in the years that
immediately followed the end of World War II, the term "premature
anti-fascist" came into currency to describe Americans who had strongly
agitated or worked against fascism before fascism was seen as a
proximate threat to the United States.

## Post-World War II

The anti-fascist movements which emerged during the period of classical
fascism continued to operate after the defeat of the
<a href="Axis_powers" class="wikilink" title="Axis powers">Axis
powers</a> in response to the resilience and mutation of fascism both in
Europe and elsewhere. In Germany, as Nazi rule crumbled in 1944,
veterans of the 1930s anti-fascist struggles formed *Antifaschistische
Ausschüsse*, *Antifaschistische Kommittees*, or
*<a href="Antifaschistische_Aktion" class="wikilink"
title="Antifaschistische Aktion">Antifaschistische Aktion</a>* groups,
all typically abbreviated to "antifa".

Modern antifa politics can be traced to opposition to the infiltration
of Britain's <a href="Punk_rock" class="wikilink" title="punk">punk</a>
scene by <a href="white_power_skinheads" class="wikilink"
title="white power skinheads">white power skinheads</a> in the 1970s and
1980s, and the emergence of
<a href="neo-Nazism" class="wikilink" title="neo-Nazism">neo-Nazism</a>
in Germany following the
<a href="fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall" class="wikilink"
title="fall of the Berlin Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a>. In Germany,
young leftists, including anarchists and punk fans, renewed the practice
of street-level anti-fascism.

## Antifascist Action

**Antifascist Action** (**Antifa**, **AFA**, or simply **Anti-Fascism**)
is a contemporary global movement of
<a href="left-wing" class="wikilink" title="left-wing">left-wing</a>
activist groups that has the primary aim of opposing fascism in all its
forms. The movement grew out of the historical anti-fascist movements
but developed distinct characteristics in the post-war period.

### Organization and Structure

Antifascist Action operates as a highly
<a href="decentralized" class="wikilink"
title="decentralized">decentralized</a> movement with no formal
hierarchical structure or official leadership. Local groups often
function as coalitions of disparate groups allied for common goals
rather than unified organizations. Groups that identify as "Antifa" can
include
<a href="anarchist" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchists</a>,
<a href="communist" class="wikilink" title="communist">communists</a>,
<a href="socialist" class="wikilink" title="socialist">socialists</a>,
and other left-wing activists with varying ideological perspectives.

The movement employs various tactics including digital activism,
community organizing, counter-protests, and in some cases physical
confrontation against those they identify as fascists or far-right
extremists. Many anti-fascist groups focus primarily on research,
education, and non-violent community organizing rather than
confrontational tactics.

### Contemporary Development

#### Germany

The contemporary antifa movement in Germany comprises different
anti-fascist groups which usually use the abbreviation antifa and regard
the historical *<a href="Antifaschistische_Aktion" class="wikilink"
title="Antifaschistische Aktion">Antifaschistische Aktion</a>* of the
early 1930s as an inspiration. Many new antifa groups formed from the
late 1980s onward. According to historians, contemporary antifa in
Germany "has no practical historical connection to the movement from
which it takes its name but is instead a product of West Germany's
squatter scene and autonomist movement in the 1980s".

#### United States

The contemporary American movement grew out of **Anti-Racist Action**,
which began in the 1980s and confronted the
<a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" class="wikilink" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux
Klan</a> and neo-Nazi
<a href="skinhead" class="wikilink" title="skinhead">skinhead</a>
groups. In the late 1980s and 1990s, ARA activists toured with popular
punk rock and skinhead bands in order to prevent
<a href="Klansmen" class="wikilink" title="Klansmen">Klansmen</a>,
neo-Nazis and other white supremacists from recruiting. Their motto was
"We go where they go."

In 2007, <a href="Rose_City_Antifa" class="wikilink"
title="Rose City Antifa">Rose City Antifa</a>, likely the first group to
utilize the name antifa in the United States, was formed in
<a href="Portland,_Oregon" class="wikilink"
title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Other antifa groups
developed independently across the country. In 2013, the most radical
chapters of the ARA formed the
<a href="Torch_Antifa_Network" class="wikilink"
title="Torch Antifa Network">Torch Antifa Network</a> which has chapters
throughout the United States.

Modern antifa in the United States engages in
<a href="protest" class="wikilink" title="protest">protest</a> tactics,
seeking to combat fascists and
<a href="racists" class="wikilink" title="racists">racists</a> such as
neo-Nazis, <a href="white_supremacists" class="wikilink"
title="white supremacists">white supremacists</a>, and other far-right
<a href="extremists" class="wikilink" title="extremists">extremists</a>.
This may involve <a href="digital_activism" class="wikilink"
title="digital activism">digital activism</a>,

and in some cases <a href="physical_violence" class="wikilink"
title="physical violence">physical violence</a> and
<a href="property_damage" class="wikilink"
title="property damage">property damage</a> against those whom they
identify as belonging to the far-right.

#### Other Countries

AFA has continued to maintain a presence in Germany, and since the
1990s, collectives have developed in other countries, including
<a href="Sweden" class="wikilink" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>,
<a href="Denmark" class="wikilink" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and
<a href="Australia" class="wikilink" title="Australia">Australia</a>.
The movement also exists in
<a href="Greece" class="wikilink" title="Greece">Greece</a>, where its
supporters sometimes clash with
<a href="police" class="wikilink" title="police">police</a> and with
<a href="nationalist" class="wikilink"
title="nationalist">nationalists</a>.

Australia's AFA collectives gained media exposure in 2015-16 following
rallies conducted in response to the growth of far-right movements. A
Swedish group, *<a href="Antifascistisk_Aktion" class="wikilink"
title="Antifascistisk Aktion">Antifascistisk Aktion</a>*, was formed in
1993.

### Tactics and Methods

Anti-fascist groups employ a variety of tactics ranging from peaceful
community organizing to militant confrontation. Common methods include:

- Research and documentation of far-right groups and individuals
- Community education and outreach
- Counter-demonstrations and protests
- "No platform" campaigns to deny fascists public speaking opportunities
- Direct action to disrupt far-right events
- Digital activism and online opposition

Some groups adopt "black bloc" tactics, involving masked participants
dressing in black clothing, largely for protection of identity during
confrontational situations.

### Criticism and Controversy

Criticism of anti-fascist movements comes from various sources. Some
critics argue that violent tactics are counter-productive and make
fascists appear as victims. Others question the effectiveness of
confrontational approaches versus peaceful alternatives.

Within the movement, there are internal divisions over tactics, with
some groups focusing exclusively on non-violent community organizing
while others embrace more militant approaches. Ideological differences
also exist between anarchist, communist, and other leftist factions
within the broader anti-fascist movement.

The decentralized nature of antifa makes it difficult to determine who
officially represents the movement, leading to situations where
individuals or groups acting violently may be associated with the
broader movement regardless of whether established anti-fascist
organizations endorse such actions.

### Government Response

Various government agencies have classified certain anti-fascist
activities as domestic terrorism or extremism. The
<a href="New_Jersey" class="wikilink" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>
Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, as well as the
<a href="Department_of_Homeland_Security" class="wikilink"
title="DHS">DHS</a> and the
<a href="FBI" class="wikilink" title="FBI">FBI</a>, have associated some
Antifa activities with "domestic terrorist violence." However, studies
have found significantly fewer fatalities linked to anti-fascist
violence compared to far-right extremist violence.

On 22 September 2025, U.S. President
<a href="Donald_Trump" class="wikilink" title="Donald Trump">Donald
Trump</a> issued an executive order designating "Antifa as a domestic
terrorist organisation".[^3] Legal scholars and civil liberties
advocates expressed concern that the broad language of the designation
could potentially be applied to any individual or group opposing fascist
ideologies or policies. Critics noted that while anti-fascist groups
received this classification, various neo-Nazi and white supremacist
organizations have not been similarly designated as domestic terrorist
groups.

## Impact and Effectiveness

Research suggests that anti-fascist activism has contributed to reducing
open fascist activity in various contexts. Notable cases include causing
some far-right figures to cancel public appearances due to anti-fascist
opposition, reducing neo-Nazi presence in punk music scenes during the
1980s, and disrupting fascist organizing efforts in multiple countries.

However, debates continue over the most effective methods for combating
fascism and far-right extremism, with some advocates preferring
community-based approaches focused on education and inclusion rather
than confrontational tactics.
