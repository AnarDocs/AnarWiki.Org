Aiming to end exploitation of workers and secure ecological harmony
green syndicalism is a form of worker-controlled unionism. Jeff Shantz

Green syndicalism is inspired by Judi Bari's efforts to organize timber
workers and environmentalists in northern California in the 1980s and
1990s, under a coalition between the
<a href="Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" class="wikilink"
title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the
World</a> (IWW) and
<a href="Earth_First!" class="wikilink" title="Earth First!">Earth
First!</a>. The IWW in 1991 voted to change its preamble for the first
time since 1908, in order to include the words "and live in harmony with
the earth." According to Shantz, "These seven words present a
significant shift in strategy regarding industrial unionism and
considerations of what is to be meant by work."[^2]

Earlier inspirations include the 1970s' Italian workerist group Porto
Marghera which campaigned for the abolition of "noxious," or
ecologically destructive work, the Australian construction workers'
1970s "green bans" that shut down over \$4 billion worth of
infrastructure projects, and the 1980s Lucas Aerospace workers' strike
that advocated, in part, building solar panels instead of nuclear
weapons.[^3]

A global movement overlapping with green syndicalism is
<a href="La_Via_Campesina" class="wikilink" title="La Via Campesina">La
Via Campesina</a>, a decentralized network of an estimated 200 million
small farmers committed to sustainable food production. The ultimate
strategy of green syndicalism involves taking over the means of
production in order to deindustrialize society, shorten the workweek,
and build a post-capitalist economy that allows humans to live in
harmony with their environment.

Green syndicalism emerges from a realization that blockades and
lockdowns will not be sufficient to halt ecological destruction. As Bari
wrote in her essay "Revolutionary Ecology," "It is only when the factory
workers refuse to make the stuff, it is only when the loggers refuse to
cut the ancient trees, that we can ever hope for real and lasting
change."[^4]
