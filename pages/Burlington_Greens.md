From 1986 to 1990, the Burlington, Vermont, chapter of the
"<a   href="US_Green_movement.md" class="wikilink"
title="US Green movement">"US Green movement</a> combined Anarchism with
an involvement in local electoral politics. The group included the
social ecologist Murray Bookchin and tried to closely follow his
philosophy of "libertarian municipalism" or Communalism. Although the
Burlington Greens did not win in their mayoral or city council
campaigns, some reforms they advocated were eventually implemented by
the city, notably the preservation of the city's waterfront.

Janet Biehl, a member of the Burlington Greens, describes the group's
structure:

> We structured the Burlington Greens nonhierarchically and
> democratically. We made decisions by voting, and voting rights were
> equal. Prospective members had to attend meetings for six months
> before requesting to join, and they had to be voted in. Membership
> reached a peak of twenty-three in September 1989. Most of the members
> were young and inexperienced, more comfortable with direct action and
> protest than with electoral politics, but they were bright and eager
> to learn.[^1]

The Burlington Greens organized against ecologically destructive
initiatives of "Socialist" Mayor Bernie Sanders who wanted to develop
high-rise condos on the waterfront. Bookchin wrote in 1986, "Sanders’
version of socialism is proving to be a subtle instrument for
rationalizing the marketplace — not for controlling it, much less
threatening it."[^2] Sanders belonged to the Progressive Party, a third
party that tended to align with the Democratic Party on national
affairs. Sanders stepped down in 1988 in order to run for Congress.

The Burlington Greens' 1989 platform advocated for a variety of "minimum
goals" including the expansion of renewable energy, "a moratorium on
growth" and a right to housing and good working conditions. The
constitution concluded, "We think these goals can be achieved only
through a movement that is antiauthoritarian and popular, one that seeks
to create a grassroots democracy. We seek to change our entire image of
progress as mindless growth into an ecological vision of progress that
will ultimately foster a new harmony between people and between humanity
and nature."[^3]

The Burlington Greens' Communalist strategy involved using local
elections both as an educational tool and as a way to ultimately take
local power. Once in charge of the local government, the Greens would
supposedly rewrite the city charter to transfer all decision making
power from bureaucracies to direct democratic assemblies. This strategy
has since been criticized by the authors of *An Anarchist FAQ*, who see
running electoral campaigns as a drain on time and resources that could
be spent on direct action.[^4]

In 1990, some members of the Burlington Greens went behind the rest of
the group's backs and made a deal with the Democrats. The Green and
Democratic candidates would throw only softball remarks at each other
during a debate in order to embarass the Progressive candidate. Biehl
recalls, "To our horror, Mahnke the Progressive lost—by a margin smaller
than the number of votes Steve the Green had received. If he and the
Democrat hadn’t colluded, Mahnke might well have won. The election was
tainted."[^5]

Once the rest of the Greens heard about the collusion, they held a
meeting and discussed whether to go public about what had happened. Some
younger members of the group were adamant that the whole affair be kept
a secret. Bookchin said, however, that he was so outraged that he would
go public if the group did not do so. With little choice, then, a
majority voted to issue a press release explaining what happened and
apologizing. Some of the younger members resented this decision. Due to
the scandal and strong internal disagreement over how the affair was
handled, the Burlington Greens quickly "passed out of existence."[^6]

Even though they did not win elections, the Burlington Greens'
educational efforts may have contributed to local environmental and
social victories in the coming years.

> In the next years \[after the collapse of the Burlington Greens\],
> Burlington’s waterfront was made into a public park. The landfill,
> owned by the people of Vermont, is today covered with an expansive
> green lawn and flowering trees; it is home to endless summer
> festivals, games, and other public events. It is Burlington’s great,
> irreplaceable treasure. The Progressives and their allies would go on
> to institute many environmental improvements, lacing the city with
> community farms and gardens; as well, they established or bolstered
> programs to support the poor, the elderly, battered women, and
> minorities. Burlington has won numerous accolades for its social and
> ecological liveliness...[^7]
