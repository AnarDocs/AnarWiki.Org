**Transport** or **Transportation** is the movement of humans, animals
and goods from one location to another. In other words the action of
transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing
from a point A to a Point B. Modes of transport include air, land (rail
and road), water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided
into infrastructure, vehicles and operations.

## Transportation in a Libertarian Socialist Society

Some have argued that a anarchist society would not be able to
coordinate the complex networks and services that make up a modern
transportation system, Friedrich Engels argued in his essay
*'<a href="On_Authority_(Book)" class="wikilink" title="On Authority">On
Authority</a>*' who claimed that attempting to institute anarchist
control of railways and shipping would simply lead to their collapse and
thus the downfall of modern civilisation. Do Engelsâ€™ claims stand up to
the evidence? Letâ€™s find out.

In Revolutionary Spain, the
<a href="National_Confederation_of_Labour_(Spain)" class="wikilink"
title="CNT">CNT</a> decided to integrate and consolidate all
transportation into an efficient system without waste. This improvement
meant better facilities, rights of way, and incomparably better service
for the riding public. Fares were reduced from 15 to 10 cents, with free
transportation for school children, wounded militiamen, those injured at
work, other invalids, and the aged.Â

Under socialized transportation better service was provided for more
riders (an increase of 50 million trips in one year). Before the
Revolution only 2% of supplies for maintenance and repairs were
manufactured by the privately owned company. Under socialization, within
only one year, 98% of the repair supplies were made in the socialized
shops. The CNT also provided free
<a href="Healthcare" class="wikilink" title="medical services">medical
services</a>, including clinics and home nursing care, for the workers
and their families.

The railways across Catalonia were also significantly improved, they
were repaired from the fighting as anarchist workers opted to organise a
non-hierarchical organisation to control the railroads, composed of
three sections, traffic, technical/engineering and administration. These
groups were responsible for the training of new workers, cleaning trains
and equipment, upkeep of locomotive depots; freight and passenger
equipment, and repair shops, provision of electricity, fuel (coal and
oil) and tracking trains and communicating between drivers through
telegraphs and telephones.[^1]

In Sri Lanka from 1958 to 1979, self-management was introduced to the
<a href="Sri_Lanka_Transport_Board" class="wikilink"
title="Sri Lanka Transport Board">Sri Lanka Transport Board</a> in order
to improve service, efficiency and morale. Construction material, fuel
and vehicles were all <a href="Standardisation" class="wikilink"
title="standardised">standardised</a> to ensure easier repairs and
replacements, whilst morale among drivers and maintenance workers
increased allowing for the smooth functioning of the worldâ€™s largest bus
service (7,000 buses serving 4,000,000 commuters a day) to function
smoothly, delivering on-time bus services, clean buses and few
accidents.

Upon the neoliberal reforms to the country in the late 1970s (in line
with a global decline in <a href="Social_Democracy" class="wikilink"
title="social democracy">social democracy</a>), self-management was
abolished as a new class of
<a href="Boss" class="wikilink" title="managers">managers</a> was
introduced, destroying morale and leading to more mistakes in the chain
of command, leading to damage in buses. By the 2000s, the board had
declined massively and gets a letter every day about overloaded buses,
buses going too fast, dangerous driving, rude staff and high fees.[^2]

The <a href="Egged_(Cooperative)" class="wikilink"
title="Egged Israel Transport Cooperative Society Ltd">Egged Israel
Transport Cooperative Society Ltd</a> or Egged, founded in 1933,
provides about 35% of Israel's public transport services, employs about
6,500 workers and operates a fleet of 2,950 buses. Egged buses transport
about 900,000 passengers per day. Egged also operates some 1,500 buses
in <a href="Poland" class="wikilink" title="Poland">Poland</a>, where it
operates some 215 buses for public transportation and serves around 40
routes daily. Although run in a way that anarchists advocate for, it is
condemned by anarchists, as Egged bus drivers have assisted the IDF by
delivering supplies to soldiers in
<a href="Israel" class="wikilink" title="Israelâ€™s">Israelâ€™s</a> various
colonial wars.[^3]
