# Anarchist Calisthenics

**Anarchist Calisthenics** is a concept introduced by anthropologist and
political scientist James C. Scott in his 2012 book *Two Cheers for
Anarchism*.[^1] The term describes deliberate practices of small-scale
rule-breaking and resistance to authority, undertaken as exercises to
maintain and develop one's capacity for autonomous thought and action
against unjust systems.

## Origins

Scott developed the concept through personal experience in
post-reunification Germany in 1990. While spending time in the town of
Neubrandenburg in the former East Germany, he observed pedestrians
waiting obediently at traffic lights even when no vehicles were present
for miles across the flat landscape. This scene prompted reflection on
obedience to authority and the atrophy of independent judgment through
habitual compliance with regulations that serve no immediate rational
purpose.[^2]

The metaphor draws from physical exercise: just as muscles require
regular use to maintain strength and capability, the capacity for
critical thinking and resistance to authority must be actively exercised
or it will atrophy. Scott argues that individuals must stay "in shape"
through regular practice of minor acts of resistance so they will be
prepared when circumstances demand more significant defiance of unjust
authority.[^3]

## Practice

Anarchist calisthenics involve intentional violation of minor rules and
regulations that serve no clear purpose or contradict reason in a given
situation. Examples include jaywalking when no traffic is present,
questioning authority figures who rely on "because I said so"
explanations, and other small acts of autonomous judgment that challenge
automatic deference to rules.

The practice requires several considerations:

- Assessment of whether a rule serves a legitimate purpose in the
  specific context
- Awareness of potential effects on others, particularly children who
  might be endangered by following a bad example
- Recognition that the goal is not constant rebellion but cultivation of
  independent judgment
- Understanding that these exercises build capacity for more significant
  resistance when genuinely necessary

## Theoretical Framework

The concept builds on anarchist principles of individual autonomy and
resistance to hierarchical authority. It addresses the problem of social
conditioning that cultivates habitual obedience and suppresses critical
engagement with rules and authority. This conditioning occurs through
constant reinforcement from parents, teachers, police, politicians and
other authority figures throughout a person's life.

Scott argues that excessive regulation and signage actually diminishes
civic capacity and intelligence by treating people as automata rather
than thinking agents. When every action is prescribed, individuals lose
practice in exercising judgment and negotiating shared space with
others. The result is both a diminished capacity for autonomous thought
and an increased tendency toward rule-following regardless of context or
rationality.

## Contemporary Applications

### Traffic Management

The principles underlying anarchist calisthenics have found unexpected
application in traffic engineering through the work of Dutch traffic
engineer Hans Monderman. Beginning in 1999, Monderman pioneered the
counterintuitive concept of "shared space," which involved removing
traffic lights and excessive signage at intersections.[^4]

In the town of Drachten, Netherlands, Monderman replaced the busiest
traffic-light intersection—handling 22,000 cars daily—with a traffic
circle, extended bicycle path, and pedestrian area. Following this
redesign, accidents dropped from 36 crashes in the four years prior to
only two crashes in the two years after removal of the traffic light.
Traffic flow improved because drivers remained alert and used common
sense rather than relying on automated signals.[^5]

Monderman's approach treats uncertainty as a feature rather than a bug.
By making intersections feel slightly dangerous, drivers become more
careful and attentive. The system relies on the intelligence and
courtesy of road users rather than attempting to eliminate all need for
judgment through comprehensive regulation.

### Revolutionary Practice

Contemporary anarchist analyses frame calisthenics as essential
preparation for revolutionary transformation. This perspective holds
that revolution is not merely a discrete event of dramatic
confrontation, but a gradual social process whereby a culture of
resistance becomes sufficiently widespread to enable larger-scale
insurrection.[^6]

From this view, revolutionary transformation begins with the cumulative
effect of small individual acts of resistance practiced daily throughout
communities. Each minor violation of unjust rules builds confidence and
capacity while normalizing autonomous judgment and non-compliance. This
everyday insurrectionary practice challenges the internalized authority
figure—the "cop in the head"—that constrains imagination and action.

## Critique and Limitations

While anarchist calisthenics emphasize individual resistance, critics
note potential limitations:

- Individual acts of rule-breaking do not automatically translate to
  collective revolutionary capacity
- Without coordination and organization, scattered resistance may remain
  ineffective against systemic power
- The metaphor may underemphasize the need for strategic collective
  action and movement-building
- Risk assessment becomes more complex when considering impacts on
  marginalized communities who face greater consequences for
  rule-breaking

The concept also requires careful distinction between resistance to
unjust authority and mere contrarianism or selfishness. The goal is
development of critical judgment about when rules serve legitimate
purposes versus when they represent unjustified impositions of
hierarchical power.
