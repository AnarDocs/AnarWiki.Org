# A New Anarchist FAQ

**A New Anarchist FAQ** is an
"<a   href="Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">anarchist</a>
frequently asked questions document hosted on
"<a   href="Raddle.md" class="wikilink" title="raddle.me">raddle.me</a> that
was authored by members of the Raddle Collective[^1], including Ziq.[^2]
The project was created as a response to the well-known
"<a   href="An_Anarchist_FAQ.md" class="wikilink" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An
Anarchist FAQ</a>, which the contributors argue suffers from ideological
bias, is extraneous and overly complicated[^3], engages in
well-poisoning[^4] and is an inadequate representation of diverse
anarchist perspectives.

## Origins

The New Anarchist FAQ was initiated as an ongoing project to foster what
its contributors describe as a "balanced, easy to digest and relevant
anarchist FAQ." According to the project's instructions, it emerged from
dissatisfaction with the existing
"<a   href="An_Anarchist_FAQ.md" class="wikilink" title="An Anarchist FAQ">An
Anarchist FAQ</a>, which critics argue is "written almost entirely by
one man and often pushes a strong Bookchinite perspective, to the point
of smearing the anarchist currents that Bookchin rallied against."[^5]

## Methodology and Approach

### Core Principles

The New Anarchist FAQ operates under several key principles that
distinguish it from other anarchist educational resources:

**Anti-Authority Stance**: The FAQ explicitly rejects pro-authority
perspectives and does not make allowances for "authority-building
systems such as democracy (direct or indirect), government (local or
otherwise), religious organizations or political parties."

**Practice Over Theory**: The project emphasizes that "practice always
takes precedence over theory," focusing on outlining the practice of
anarchy rather than encouraging readers to align with particular
theoretical tribes within the anarchist milieu.

**Anarchism Without Adjectives**: The FAQ promotes an "anarchism without
adjectives" perspective, avoiding centering any particular anarchist
school of thought and instead presenting diverse anarchist economic
models and approaches.

### Contemporary Focus

Unlike many anarchist educational materials, the New Anarchist FAQ
deliberately avoids focusing heavily on historical anarchist
experiments. The contributors argue that "anarchy cannot be centered in
the distant past" and emphasize "anarchy in the modern world, avoiding
nostalgic romanticism."

## Content and Structure

The FAQ addresses various topics including economics, ecology, religion,
and contemporary anarchist practice. It takes positions that sometimes
conflict with mainstream anarchist discourse, such as:

- Critical examination of
  "<a   href="Workerism.md" class="wikilink" title="workerism">workerism</a>
  and labor-centered approaches to anarchism
- Skeptical treatment of democratic organizing methods
- Emphasis on individual and small-group autonomous action
- Integration of
  "<a   href="Green_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchist">green
  anarchist</a> and "<a   href="Primitivism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="primitivist">primitivist</a> perspectives

## Reception and Criticism

The project has generated significant discussion and controversy within
anarchist communities. Initial reception on platforms like
"<a   href="Reddit.md" class="wikilink" title="Reddit">Reddit</a> showed mixed
responses, with supporters praising its attempt to present diverse
perspectives and critics expressing concern about its post-left
orientation.

### Supporters

Supporters appreciate the FAQ's:

- Inclusion of perspectives often marginalized in mainstream anarchist
  discourse
- Choice to prioritize demonstrable actions rather than theoretical
  systems
- Focus on contemporary practice over historical examples
- Attempt to move beyond the dominant left vs. right dichotomy
- Critique of democratic and organizationalist tendencies
- Dedication to being crowd-sourced in the form of an open wiki that
  anyone can contribute to
- Promoting inclusivity and not engaging in sectarian attacks against
  legitimate anarchist tendencies

### Critics

Critics have raised concerns about:[^6]

- The choice to not center the
  "<a   href="Anarcho-Syndicalism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="anarcho-syndicalist">anarcho-syndicalist</a> and
  "<a   href="Anarcho-Communism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="anarcho-communist">anarcho-communist</a> approaches despite
  their considerable popularity
- Limited contributor base potentially recreating the single-author
  problems it criticizes
- An anti-majoritarianism stance that some argue contradicts certain
  anarchist organizing methods
- The FAQ being highly critical of religious anarchists, especially
  Christians, who may feel attacked
- There being an "anti-work" section which may alienate certain
  anarchists who prioritize the workplace, especially Syndicalists
- Though the stated aim is to promote "anarchism without adjectives",
  some critics rebuke it for promoting "post-left" perspectives in
  certain sections

## Relationship to Post-Left Anarchism

Certain sections of the New Anarchist FAQ reflect themes central to
"<a   href="Post-Left_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Post-Left Anarchism">Post-Left Anarchism</a>, including:

- Criticism of leftist organizing methods and ideology
- Championing individual autonomy as much as collective action
- Skepticism toward formal organizations and majoritarian democratic
  processes
- Integration of
  "<a   href="Egoist_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="egoist">egoist</a>
  and "<a   href="Nihilist_Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
  title="nihilist">nihilist</a> perspectives
- Focus on immediate liberation rather than revolutionary programs that
  aim to build governance

## Current Status

As of 2025, the project remains active but with limited contributors.
The FAQ is described as "very unfinished and constantly undergoing
revisions," reflecting its founders' view that it should mirror "anarchy
itself" in its ongoing development.

The project continues to seek contributors while maintaining its
commitment to avoiding the perceived biases of existing anarchist
educational materials.
