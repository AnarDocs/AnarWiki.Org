# Anarchism Without Adjectives

**Anarchism without adjectives**, sometimes stylized as **Anarchism w/o
Adjectives**, is a
"<a   href="Pluralism_(political_philosophy).md" class="wikilink"
title="pluralist">"pluralist</a> tendency of
"<a   href="anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchism">"anarchism</a>
that opposes "<a   href="sectarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="sectarianism">"sectarianism</a> and advocates for cooperation
between different
"<a   href="anarchist_schools_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist schools of thought">"anarchist schools of thought</a>.
The tendency rejects what proponents believe to be sectarian labels
(e.g. "<a   href="Anarcho-Communism.md" class="wikilink"

"<a   href="Ecological-Anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ecological-Anarchism">"Ecological-Anarchism</a>, etc.) in favor of
co-operation between anarchists of differing viewpoints. First
formulated by the "<a   href="Anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"

influential anarchists including the Italian

Anarchists without adjectives are suspicious of
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">"dogmatism</a> and are
often critical of dogmatic ideologies or proponents, while holding
skepticism about prescriptions for a
"<a   href="post-capitalism.md" class="wikilink"

consider "<a   href="authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"

"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"

could result in the experimental development of different economic forms

present through

## Background

After the founding of the
"<a   href="Anti-authoritarian_International.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anti-authoritarian International">"Anti-authoritarian
International</a>, by 1876, debates between anti-authoritarians broke
out over which "<a   href="economic_system.md" class="wikilink"
title="economic system">"economic system</a> they would establish
following a "<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a>.[^1] Swiss anarchist
leader
"<a   href="James_Guillaume.md" class="wikilink" title="James Guillaume">"James
Guillaume</a> spurred the debate with his proposition that, once a
condition of "<a   href="post-scarcity.md" class="wikilink"
title="post-scarcity">"post-scarcity</a> was achieved, resources could be
brought under "<a   href="common_ownership.md" class="wikilink"
title="common ownership">"common ownership</a> and distributed ""<a   href="From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs.md"
class="wikilink"
title="from each according to ability, to each according to need">"from
each according to ability, to each according to need</a>".[^2]

French and Italian members of the International advocated for a system
of "<a   href="anarchist_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="communist anarchism">"communist anarchism</a>, in which the
"<a   href="state_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> and
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>
would be replaced by "<a   href="voluntary_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="voluntary association">"voluntary associations</a> which would
make goods and services
"<a   href="Commons.md" class="wikilink" title="freely available">"freely
available</a> to all who needed them. On the other side, the
"<a   href="Spanish_Regional_Federation_of_the_IWA.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish section">"Spanish section</a> advocated for
"<a   href="collectivist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist anarchism">"collectivist anarchism</a>, which would
distribute resources
""<a   href="to_each_according_to_his_contribution.md" class="wikilink"
title="to each according to contribution">"to each according to
contribution</a>".[^3] At the 1877 Verviers Conference, James Guillaume
attempted to overcome the split by arguing that "each group be free to
determine its own solutions".[^4]

Guillaume's position was adopted by a number of
"<a   href="Anarchism_in_Spain.md" class="wikilink"
title="Spanish anarchists">"Spanish anarchists</a>, who advocated for the
tolerance of different, coexisting
"<a   href="anarchist_schools_of_thought.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist schools of thought">"anarchist schools of thought</a>.[^5]
In 1886, Catalan anarchists around the periodical *Acracia* began
attempting to settle the communist-collectivist split by propagating a
kind of ""<a   href="non-denominational.md" class="wikilink"
title="non-denominational">"non-denominational</a>" anarchism. Despite
opposition from anarchist communists around the
*"<a   href="Tierra_y_Libertad_(newspaper).md" class="wikilink"
title="Tierra y Libertad">"Tierra y Libertad</a>* paper, these anarchists
began referring to themselves as
""<a   href="social_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="socialist anarchists">"socialist anarchists</a>" and used terms
such as "indifferent anarchism" (anarquismo a secas) in order to
overcome the divide.[^6]

In 1888, the anti-sectarian campaign was adopted by a circle of
anarchist intellectuals led by
"<a   href="Antoni_Pellicer.md" class="wikilink"
title="Antoni Pellicer">"Antoni Pellicer</a>, who formulated a
perspective that rejected any qualifying labels for anarchism.[^7] This
perspective was developed further by the political theorists
"<a   href="Fernando_Tarrida_del_Mármol.md" class="wikilink"
title="Fernando Tarrida del Mármol">"Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</a> and
"<a   href="Ricardo_Mella.md" class="wikilink" title="Ricardo Mella">"Ricardo
Mella</a>, who articulated an "unhyphenated form of anarchism" which
they termed "anarchism without adjectives" (Anarquismo sin
adjetivos).[^8]

## Formulation

### By Tarrida

A pupil of "<a   href="Anselmo_Lorenzo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anselmo Lorenzo">"Anselmo Lorenzo</a>, Tarrida had initially been
attracted to "<a   href="collectivist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="collectivist anarchism">"collectivist anarchism</a>, through the
"<a   href="federalism.md" class="wikilink" title="federalism">"federalism</a>
of "<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and
"<a   href="Francesc_Pi_i_Margall.md" class="wikilink"
title="Francesc Pi i Margall">"Francesc Pi i Margall</a>. By 1889, he had
become a prolific anarchist speaker and writer for *Acracia*, winning
support from many of Barcelona's workers, who delegated him to the
"<a   href="International_Workers_Congresses_of_Paris,_1889.md"
class="wikilink"
title="International Workers Congresses of Paris">"International Workers
Congresses of Paris</a>.[^9] Drawing from his background in
"<a   href="mathematics.md" class="wikilink"
title="mathematics">"mathematics</a>, Tarrida considered anarchism to be
a "<a   href="Universalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="universal philosophy">"universal philosophy</a> with
scientifically validated principles. Although himself a collectivist, he
rejected rigid
"<a   href="doctrine.md" class="wikilink" title="doctrine">"doctrine</a> and
refused to engage in the debate between the collectivists and
communists, instead upholding Pellicer's formula for an anarchism that
included a diversity of economic systems. From this position, he first
developed his theory of "anarchism without adjectives".[^10]

Tarrida first used the term at a November 1889 meeting in Barcelona,
when he called for anarchists to reject of all forms of
"<a   href="dogma.md" class="wikilink" title="dogma">"dogma</a> in order to
conform closer with the principles of
""<a   href="nature.md" class="wikilink" title="nature">"nature</a>,
"<a   href="science.md" class="wikilink" title="science">"science</a> and
"<a   href="justice.md" class="wikilink" title="justice">"justice</a>".[^11]
The communist-collectivist feud, which dominated the anarchist discourse
of the time, had encouraged Tarrida to issue an appeal for an
"<a   href="ecumenism.md" class="wikilink" title="ecumenical">"ecumenical</a>
approach to anarchism, calling for tolerance between different anarchist
tendencies in order to focus on the cause of revolutionary anarchism. He
concluded that if anarchists were to be consistent with their
anti-dogmatic tendencies, which upheld freedom of thought, they ought
not to impose their own economic programmes on others. Nevertheless, the
feud persisted, with French communists denouncing the Spanish
collectivists as authoritarian and scrutinising Tarrida's proposal for
an "anarchism without adjectives".[^12]

The following year, in the pages of the French communist newspaper
*"<a   href="Le_Révolté.md" class="wikilink" title="Le Révolté">"Le Révolté</a>*,
Tarrida replied that the pursuit of
"<a   href="anarchy.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchy">"anarchy</a> and the
abolition of the
"<a   href="State_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="State">"State</a> ought
to be emphasised as the common foundation of anarchism.[^13] He held the
economic question to be of "secondary importance", rejecting any rigid
systematic theory and upholding the complementary potential of different
anarchist economic propositions.[^14] The French communists, he argued,
had become too ideologically rigid and puritanical, which had isolated
them from other anarchist groups and rendered them ineffective as a
force against the "<a   href="bourgeoisie.md" class="wikilink"
title="bourgeoisie">"bourgeoisie</a>. He concluded by encouraging them to
drop their "<a   href="utopian_socialism.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian tendencies">"utopian tendencies</a> to preconceive an
immutable future anarchist society, so that they could better adapt to
the changing social and economic conditions of the present.[^15]

He also criticised the French communists for attempting to impose a
"foreign style of anarchism" on Spanish collectivists, whose
organisationalist tendencies had arisen from different
"<a   href="Material_conditions.md" class="wikilink"
title="material conditions">"material conditions</a> and had proven an
effective response to those conditions.[^16] Although Tarrida rejected
the communists' indiscriminate anti-organizational stance, he was also
opposed to rigidity within Spanish collectivism. For example, he
accepted the dissolution of the
"<a   href="Federation_of_Workers_of_the_Spanish_Region.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federation of Workers of the Spanish Region">"Federation of
Workers of the Spanish Region</a> (FTRE) when it grew too bureaucratic
to effectively achieve its original aims.[^17]

### By Mella

A different approach to "anarchism without adjectives" was taken up by
the prolific anarchist theorist
"<a   href="Ricardo_Mella.md" class="wikilink" title="Ricardo Mella">"Ricardo
Mella</a>. In contrast to Tarrida, who recommended that different
anarchist systems be synthesised, Mella called for free experimentation
to determine the best system for a given circumstance. Mella believed
that the great divide within anarchism was not between communism and
collectivism, but between tolerance and intransigence, the latter of
which created divisions over the supremacy of different forms of
dogma.[^18] When Mella began writing for *Acracia*, he initially called
for tolerance between anarchist tendencies as a way to prevent communist
ideas from becoming predominant in Spain. In his article "La reacción y
la revolución", Mella argued against dogmatic economic prescriptions for
a future anarchist society, declaring that a revolutionary movement
could only arise from a diversity of perspectives that could "proceed
according to whatever traditions and customs best suited the
circumstances at hand".[^19]

Although Mella remained a staunch collectivist and anti-communist,[^20]
he nevertheless opposed the internecine split between the two factions,
attempting to keep the debate between them healthy by continuing his
advocacy of non-denominational anarchism.[^21] As time went on, he
became more tolerant of communism, considering it to be possible for it
to coexist alongside other economic systems. He even went on to defend
anarchist communists from attacks by the Italian criminologist
"<a   href="Cesare_Lombroso.md" class="wikilink"
title="Cesare Lombroso">"Cesare Lombroso</a> and translated the work of
"<a   href="Peter_Kropotkin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Kropotkin">"Peter
Kropotkin</a>, although he remained uncomfortable fully endorsing
communist views for the rest of his life.[^22]

In 1889, Mella published the apotheosis of his development of anarchism
without adjectives: his
"<a   href="Utopian_and_dystopian_fiction.md" class="wikilink"
title="utopian novella">"utopian novella</a> *La Nueva Utopía*, which
examined the possible social and economic forms of a future anarchist
society. In the book, Mella depicts a society that had undergone a
"<a   href="social_revolution.md" class="wikilink"
title="social revolution">"social revolution</a>, resulting in the
complete satisfaction of their needs and a harmonious cooperation
between its inhabitants.[^23] Such an economic and social reorganization
of society had been achieved after multiple centuries of experimentation
and hard work, driven by scientific and technological progress, which
had eliminated both toil and environmental pollution.[^24]

## Growth and adoption

### In Europe

Throughout the 1890s, Tarrida and Mella continued their campaign for the
adoption of a non-sectarian form of anarchism, eventually achieving some
success. Many other anarchists, including
"<a   href="Anselmo_Lorenzo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Anselmo Lorenzo">"Anselmo Lorenzo</a> and
"<a   href="Joan_Montseny.md" class="wikilink" title="Joan Montseny">"Joan
Montseny</a>, began calling for an end to the dogmatic schism between
communists and collectivists, with the adjectives themselves even taking
on negative connotations among those who had tired of the split.[^25]
Inspired by Tarrida and Mella, many other European anarchists began to
eschew hyphenated labels and refer solely to anarchy as their end goal,
rejecting prescriptions for a future society as inherently
"<a   href="authoritarianism.md" class="wikilink"
title="authoritarian">"authoritarian</a>.[^26] Anarchism without
adjectives was taken up by
"<a   href="Élisée_Reclus.md" class="wikilink" title="Élisée Reclus">"Élisée
Reclus</a> and
"<a   href="Max_Nettlau.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Nettlau">"Max
Nettlau</a>,[^27] the latter of whom called for a non-sectarian
anarchism that accounted for both
"<a   href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">"communism</a> and
"<a   href="individualism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualism">"individualism</a>, without universalizing either,
leaving room for experimentation in different possibilities of economic
organization.[^28]

The position was also adopted by the Italian communist
"<a   href="Errico_Malatesta.md" class="wikilink"
title="Errico Malatesta">"Errico Malatesta</a>,[^29] who could previously
be best described as an
"<a   href="Insurrectionary-Anarchist.md" class="wikilink"
title="Insurrectionary-Anarchist">"Insurrectionary-Anarchist</a> before
his adoption of the tendency. Malatesta likewise argued against
dogmatism within the anarchist movement,[^30] declaring: "Let us do away
with all exclusivism of schools of thinking."[^31] Malatesta warned that
"one must beware, at the risk of certain disaster, of supposing that
one's system is the only, and infallible, one \[...\] and that its
success must be assured at all costs, by means other than those which
depend on persuasion, which spring from the evidence of facts."[^32]

Malatesta posited that as anarchism centres
"<a   href="Revolutionary_spontaneity.md" class="wikilink"
title="spontaneity">"spontaneity</a>, it would be wrong for anarchists to
impose economic prescriptions. He concluded that different anarchist
tendencies should therefore unite within a single organisation, which
centred a shared anarchist method. Malatesta also began referring to
himself as an ""<a   href="social_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist socialist">"anarchist socialist</a>", in order to
promote inclusivity of different anarchist schools.[^33] In the pages of
*Le Révolté*, Malatesta declared that "\[i\]t is not right for us, to
say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses".[^34]

By the turn of the 20th century, anarchism without adjectives had spread
beyond Europe to the
"<a   href="Americas.md" class="wikilink" title="Americas">"Americas</a>, where
many anarchists were increasingly migrating. In
"<a   href="Buenos_Aires.md" class="wikilink" title="Buenos Aires">"Buenos
Aires</a>, Antoni Pellicer argued that Argentine workers ought to reject
dogmatism and embrace anarchism without adjectives. It also found its
way to the
"<a   href="United_States.md" class="wikilink" title="United States">"United
States</a>, where American anarchists were brought over to the idea by
the arguments of Tarrida.[^35]

### In the United States

In the United States, there was also an intense debate between
"<a   href="Individualist_anarchism_in_the_United_States.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchists">"individualist anarchists</a> around
"<a   href="Benjamin_Tucker.md" class="wikilink"
title="Benjamin Tucker">"Benjamin Tucker</a> and the anarchist communists
around "<a   href="Johann_Most.md" class="wikilink" title="Johann Most">"Johann
Most</a>, who dismissed each other's ideas as un-anarchistic.[^36]
Troubled by the "bitter debates" between anarchists from divergent
schools of economic thought, those who did not see a need to confine
themselves to one particular school of thought called for more tolerance
among anarchists, with some of them explicitly terming it "anarchism
without adjectives".[^37]

Starting in the 1880s, many American anarchists began to prioritize
their commonly held "<a   href="anti-statism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anti-statism">"anti-statism</a> over their differing economic
methods, which they saw as of secondary importance and something to be
left until the future.[^38] In 1893,
"<a   href="William_Holmes_(anarchist).md" class="wikilink"
title="William">"William</a> and
"<a   href="Lizzie_Holmes.md" class="wikilink" title="Lizzie Holmes">"Lizzie
Holmes</a> organized an international anarchist conference in
"<a   href="Chicago.md" class="wikilink" title="Chicago">"Chicago</a>, where
they attempted to formulate a common programme for anarchists to unite
behind. They were joined by
"<a   href="Voltairine_de_Cleyre.md" class="wikilink"
title="Voltairine de Cleyre">"Voltairine de Cleyre</a>,
"<a   href="Honoré_Jackson.md" class="wikilink" title="Honoré Jackson">"Honoré
Jackson</a>,
"<a   href="C._L._James.md" class="wikilink" title="C. L. James">"C. L.
James</a>,
"<a   href="Lucy_Parsons.md" class="wikilink" title="Lucy Parsons">"Lucy
Parsons</a> and "<a   href="William_Henry_van_Ornum.md" class="wikilink"
title="William Henry van Ornum">"William Henry van Ornum</a>, but the
conference was boycotted by Benjamin Tucker and Johann Most, who were
still locked in an ideological conflict.[^39] Over the subsequent years,
the Holmes couple and their circle continued attempting to reconcile the
different anarchist factions, even going as far as to advocate for an
anti-authoritarian
"<a   href="united_front.md" class="wikilink" title="united front">"united
front</a> with
"<a   href="Georgism.md" class="wikilink" title="Georgists">"Georgists</a>,
"<a   href="socialism.md" class="wikilink" title="socialists">"socialists</a>
and "<a   href="nationalists.md" class="wikilink"
title="nationalists">"nationalists</a>. In 1895, the Jewish anarchist
"<a   href="J._A._Maryson.md" class="wikilink" title="J. A. Maryson">"J. A.
Maryson</a> began calling for a "pure and simple" anarchism that upheld
freedom of opinion, arguing that diversity was an essential component of
freedom.[^40]

By the 1900s, the most visible American exponent of anarchism without
adjectives was Voltairine de Cleyre,[^41] who could be described as an
individualist anarchist before her adoption of the tendency. She adopted
the term from Tarrida,[^42] and likewise advocated for cooperation
between different anarchist philosophies and strategies.[^43] She
criticised economic dogmatism,[^44] believing that after the
"<a   href="state_(polity).md" class="wikilink" title="state">"state</a> was
abolished, different localities would be free to experiment in different
economic forms of anarchism,[^45] ranging from
"<a   href="mutualism_(economic_theory).md" class="wikilink"
title="mutualism">"mutualism</a> to
"<a   href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">"communism</a>.[^46]

During the last years of her life, de Cleyre argued passionately against
anarchist sectarianism, declaring her desire to rid the anarchist
movement of "those outrageous "<a   href="excommunication.md" class="wikilink"
title="excommunication">"excommunications</a> which belong properly to
the "<a   href="Excommunication_in_the_Catholic_Church.md" class="wikilink"
title="Church of Rome">"Church of Rome</a>, and which serve no purpose
but to bring us into deserved contempt with outsiders."[^47] Skeptical
of "high-sounding theories", which she considered to be indicative of
"<a   href="intellectual_elitism.md" class="wikilink"
title="intellectual elitism">"intellectual elitism</a>, de Cleyre
preferred to support
"<a   href="Action_(philosophy).md" class="wikilink" title="action">"action</a>
in the present rather than indulge in debates over the future.[^48] She
believed that a future free society could not be forecast, due to the
uncertainty of how society might evolve, and thus upheld all experiments
in the direction of greater freedom as intrinsically good.[^49]

As she saw shortcomings in each anarchist school of thought, arguing for
the best elements of each to be synthesized into a more
"<a   href="pragmatism.md" class="wikilink"
title="pragmatic philosophy">"pragmatic philosophy</a>, historian
"<a   href="Paul_Avrich.md" class="wikilink" title="Paul Avrich">"Paul
Avrich</a> argued that de Cleyre "cannot be fitted into any single
anarchist category".[^50] Until the end of her life, she insisted on
labelling herself simply as an "anarchist",[^51] even as she personally
moved from
"<a   href="Individualist_anarchism_in_the_United_States.md" class="wikilink"
title="American individualism">"American individualism</a> towards the
"<a   href="anarchist_communism.md" class="wikilink"
title="anarchist communism">"anarchist communism</a> advocated by
"<a   href="Emma_Goldman.md" class="wikilink" title="Emma Goldman">"Emma
Goldman</a>.[^52] Herself inspired by
"<a   href="Max_Stirner.md" class="wikilink" title="Max Stirner">"Max
Stirner</a>'s "<a   href="individualist_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="individualist anarchism">"individualist anarchism</a>, Goldman
also came to reject visionary thinking of "blueprints for the future",
instead declaring that anarchist methods must be adapted depending on
the circumstances of different places and times.[^53]

Anarchism without adjectives was later taken up by
"<a   href="Luigi_Galleani.md" class="wikilink" title="Luigi Galleani">"Luigi
Galleani</a> and the *"<a   href="Galleanisti.md" class="wikilink"
title="Galleanisti">"Galleanisti</a>*, who went so far as to reject
formal organizational structures, claiming the end point of any
organization was to move towards "<a   href="conservatism.md" class="wikilink"
title="conservatism">"conservatism</a> and eventually become
"<a   href="reactionary.md" class="wikilink"
title="reactionary">"reactionary</a>.[^54] Other Italian-American
anarchists, who were not followers of Galleani, also came to consider
themselves anarchists without adjectives, rejecting specific currents
and individual leaders.[^55]

## Contemporary developments

Eventually, the term "anarchism without adjectives" largely fell out of
use, although its anti-sectarian principles were still implicitly upheld
by some "<a   href="contemporary_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="contemporary anarchists">"contemporary anarchists</a>, following
the development of diverse
"<a   href="new_social_movements.md" class="wikilink"
title="new social movements">"new social movements</a>.[^56] Research by
Dana M. Williams found that North American anarchists were more likely
to reject the labels of
""<a   href="social_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="red">"red</a>" or
""<a   href="green_anarchism.md" class="wikilink" title="green anarchist">"green
anarchist</a>", in favour of simply identifying as "anarchist",
"anti-authoritarian" or some form of "anarchist without
adjectives".[^57]

Voltairine de Cleyre's contributions to anarchism without adjectives
have been particularly influential on the development of contemporary
anarchism,[^58] which has often neglected prescriptive models for
alternatives to "<a   href="globalization.md" class="wikilink"
title="globalization">"globalization</a> and
"<a   href="neoliberalism.md" class="wikilink"
title="neoliberalism">"neoliberalism</a>.[^59] De Cleyre's conception of
anarchism without adjectives was adopted by the anarchist historian
"<a   href="Peter_Marshall_(author,_born_1946).md" class="wikilink"
title="Peter Marshall">"Peter Marshall</a>, who argued against
"<a   href="False_dilemma.md" class="wikilink" title="false binaries">"false
binaries</a> that separate economic systems or dichotomise the
"<a   href="individual.md" class="wikilink" title="individual">"individual</a>
against the
"<a   href="community.md" class="wikilink" title="community">"community</a>.[^60]
The anarchist communist Wayne Price has also proposed that a
post-capitalist transition would be carried out in an "experimental,
pluralist, and decentralized society", which would utilise different
solutions to the specific issues that affect them.[^61]
"<a   href="Post-anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Post-anarchism">"Post-anarchism</a>, while attaching an adjective
