Teotihuacan was an ancient city in the Valley of Mexico from around 100
BCE to 600 CE, with an estimated population of 100,000 people. Although
Teotihuacan began as a highly stratified society, major changes occurred
around 300 CE. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent was desecrated and
partially destroyed. Residents permanently ended new pyramid
construction and ritual sacrifice of city residents. Resources were
directed toward construction of comfortable apartment complexes for the
vast majority of the city's populace. The city's artwork from this later
period portrayed people as being roughly the same size and at the same
level, with no depictions of rulers. According to David Graeber and
David Wengrow, "The general consensus among those who know the site best
is that Teotihuacan was, in fact, a city organized along some sort of
self-consciously egalitarian lines."[^1]

Art historian Esther Pazstory notes that Teotihuacan art appears to have
purposely avoided the styles of more hierarchical Mesoamerican societies
such as the Maya and Zapotec. Avoiding the curves and flows of of Maya
and Zapotec art, Teotihuacan's art used angular blocks. The absence of
ceremonial ball courts also suggests a conscious rejection of the Maya
and Zapotec aristocratic spectacles.[^2]

Although Teotihuacan became less hierarchical, it did not become fully
egalitarian and peaceful. Although the mere existence of the apartment
complexes is remarkable, the fact is that they "range in quality from
spacious, even palatial, homes to crowded and more slumlike
quarters."[^3] And although sacrificing city residents stopped, the
sacrifice of war captives continued in the neighborhood of Teopancazco.
The city's internal tensions were apparently responsible for the city's
disintegration.[^4]
