short stories written by Scottish author
"<a   href="Iain_M._Banks.md" class="wikilink" title="Iain M. Banks">"Iain M.

"<a   href="The_Culture.md" class="wikilink" title="The Culture">"The
Culture</a>, a post-scarcity anarchist civilisation spanning the galaxy,
composed of various humanoid species and advanced artificial
intelligences living in harmony.

## Overview

The Culture series consists of ten books exploring themes of anarchism,
post-scarcity economics, artificial intelligence, and interventionist
foreign policy. Set primarily in the 28th to 30th centuries, the novels
follow various characters living on the margins of the Culture as they
interact with other galactic civilisations.

The Culture itself represents one of science fiction's most detailed
explorations of anarchist society, featuring no government, laws, or
money, yet maintaining order through consensus and the benevolent
guidance of superintelligent AIs called

## Major Themes

### Post-Scarcity Anarchism

The Culture represents a fully realised anarchist society without
government, laws, or money. [^1] All essential work is performed by
non-sentient machines or AIs, freeing biological citizens to pursue
whatever interests them. The society operates on the principle that
"money implies poverty" and rejects all forms of economics based on
anything other than voluntary activity.

### Artificial Intelligence and Posthumanism

The Culture is a symbiotic society where artificial intelligences, from
human-equivalent drones to vastly superior Minds, share equal
citizenship with biological beings. This explores themes of
technological singularity and posthuman evolution, presenting AI not as
a threat but as equal partners in civilisation.

### Interventionism vs Non-Interference

A central tension throughout the series involves the Culture's dilemma
over intervening in less advanced civilisations. The organisation
"<a   href="Contact_(The_Culture).md" class="wikilink"
title="Contact">"Contact</a> and its intelligence wing Special
Circumstances engage in "good works" to guide other societies toward
more humane paths, often employing morally questionable methods
including blackmail, regime change, and false flag operations.

### Liberal Idealism and Its Contradictions

The series examines how even an ideal liberal society must compromise
its values when dealing with external threats and moral complexities.
The Culture's interventions sometimes mirror Western foreign policy,
raising questions about cultural imperialism and the ethics of imposed
liberation.

## The Culture Civilisation

### Society

The Culture has no formal government, laws, or enforcement. Social norms
are maintained through reputation, ostracism for serious crimes, and
voluntary supervision. The only serious prohibition is against harming
sentient beings or forcing them to act against their will.

Citizens can modify their bodies extensively, change biological sex,
control pain, and live for centuries. Most possess "drug glands"
allowing conscious control over their brain chemistry. The majority live
on massive spaceships or artificial habitats called Orbitals rather than
planets.

### Technology

Culture technology includes faster-than-light travel, matter
displacement (teleportation), anti-gravity, powerful forcefields, and
advanced nanotechnology. Their most sophisticated creations are the
Minds - artificial intelligences existing partially in hyperspace with
capabilities far exceeding biological intelligence.

### Citizens

The Culture comprises approximately thirty trillion beings including:

- **Humans and humanoids** - Genetically enhanced biological beings
  forming the majority
- **Drones** - Roughly human-equivalent AIs with various capabilities
- **Minds** - Vastly superior AIs controlling ships and habitats
- **Various alien species** - Non-humanoid beings who have joined the
  Culture

## Literary Significance

The Culture series helped revive space opera as a serious literary form,
moving beyond the genre's earlier limitations through sophisticated
political and philosophical themes. [^2] Banks rejected both the
dystopian assumptions of cyberpunk and the imperial overtones of
traditional space opera, creating instead a genuinely progressive vision
of humanity's future.

## Anarchist Perspective

The series has generated significant discussion within anarchist
circles, with some praising its depiction of a functioning anarchist
society while others critique its dependence on benevolent artificial
intelligence. [^3] Critics argue that the hierarchy between Minds and
biological citizens, while benevolent, still represents a form of
paternalistic authority inconsistent with true anarchist principles.

The Culture's interventionist foreign policy has also drawn comparison
to Western imperialism, though supporters argue the Culture's
post-scarcity nature eliminates material motivations for exploitation.

## Legacy

The Culture series has influenced numerous science fiction works and
continues to serve as a touchstone for discussions of anarchism,
artificial intelligence, and posthuman society. The series demonstrates
that anarchist societies need not be primitive or austere, offering
instead a vision of anarchism enhanced by advanced technology and
genuine abundance.

Companies and organisations have paid tribute to the series, with SpaceX
naming several autonomous ships after Culture vessels, and the Five
Deeps Expedition naming all its craft after Culture ships and drones.
