# Anti-Authoritarian and Anarchist Armies

## Overview

Anti-authoritarian and anarchist armies are military forces organized
along principles of voluntary association, direct democracy, and minimal
hierarchy. Throughout history, various movements have attempted to
create military organizations that reject traditional command structures
while maintaining combat effectiveness. These forces typically feature
elected and recallable officers, communal decision-making, and
integration of revolutionary social principles with military objectives.

## Historical Examples

### Ancient and Medieval Period

#### Early Democratic Forces

**Germanic war bands** (1st century BCE - 5th century CE) operated with
elected war leaders chosen based on merit. According to Tacitus, these
bands could abandon leaders who lost their confidence, and major
military decisions required assembly approval.[^1]

**Greek democratic militias** developed elements of collective
decision-making beyond the famous hoplite phalanxes. The Ten Thousand
Greek mercenaries (401-399 BCE) notably elected new leaders and made
collective decisions during their march through Persia after their
commanders were killed.[^2]

#### Medieval Peasant Republics

The **Dithmarschen Peasant Republic** (12th century-1559) in modern-day
Germany maintained militia forces with elected military leaders and
communal decision-making. These forces successfully defeated several
aristocratic armies, including Danish royal forces in 1500, maintaining
independence for centuries through democratic military organization.[^3]

**Swiss Cantonal Militias** (13th-16th centuries) operated with
remarkable democratic principles. Officers were elected, major decisions
required consultation with troops, and these militias successfully
resisted Habsburg and Burgundian armies while maintaining republican
governance.[^4]

The **Hussite Warriors** (1419-1436) in Bohemia, particularly the
radical Taborites, implemented relatively egalitarian military
structures. They elected their captains, held councils for major
decisions, and combined religious radicalism with social leveling
principles.[^5]

#### Maritime Democracy

**Pirate crews** during the "Golden Age" (1650-1730) operated as
floating democracies. Captains were elected and could be deposed by crew
vote, plunder was distributed according to agreed articles, and major
decisions required crew consensus. These represented some of the most
democratic institutions of their era.[^6]

The **Victual Brothers** (1390s-1430s) in the Baltic Sea operated as a
confederation of equal privateers with elected leaders and communal
decision-making, controlling several ports and challenging traditional
maritime authorities.[^7]

### Early Modern Period

#### Cossack Hosts

**Cossack Hosts** (15th-18th centuries), particularly the Zaporozhian
Sich, operated as military democracies. They elected their hetmans
(leaders) annually, required general assembly (rada) approval for major
decisions, and maintained egalitarian principles within their ranks,
though this varied over time with some hosts becoming more
hierarchical.[^8]

#### Peasant Rebellions

The **German Peasants' War forces** (1524-1525) included bands that
operated with elected leaders and communal decision-making, particularly
those influenced by radical reformation theology. The "Twelve Articles"
demanded elected pastors and community self-governance.[^9]

**Wat Tyler's Rebellion** (1381) in England saw peasant armies that
elected their own captains and made collective decisions about demands
and movements.[^10]

The **Ikko-ikki** (15th-16th century Japan) were Buddhist sectarian
armies incorporating peasants and lower samurai, operating with more
egalitarian principles than traditional Japanese forces.[^11]

## Modern Anarchist Armies

### Paris Commune (1871)

While not exclusively anarchist, many anarchists participated in the
**Paris Commune's National Guard**, which attempted to defend
revolutionary Paris. The Commune's forces implemented democratic
principles including elected officers and collective
decision-making.[^12]

### Ukrainian Revolution (1918-1921)

The **Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine** (Black Army or
Makhnovshchina) led by
"<a   href="Nestor_Makhno.md" class="wikilink" title="Nestor Makhno">Nestor
Makhno</a> controlled significant territory in Ukraine. This force
fought against both White and Red armies while implementing anarchist
principles including elected commanders and voluntary association. They
promoted peasant self-governance in liberated areas and fielded up to
30,000 fighters at their peak.[^13][^14]

### Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)

The **CNT-FAI militias** represented perhaps the most significant
anarchist military force in history. The
"<a   href="Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo.md" class="wikilink"
title="Confederación Nacional del Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del
Trabajo</a> (CNT) and
"<a   href="Federación_Anarquista_Ibérica.md" class="wikilink"
title="Federación Anarquista Ibérica">Federación Anarquista Ibérica</a>
(FAI) organized militias controlling large parts of Catalonia and
Aragon. These forces operated with elected delegates, rotating
positions, and minimal hierarchy.

The **Durruti Column**, led by
"<a   href="Buenaventura_Durruti.md" class="wikilink"
title="Buenaventura Durruti">Buenaventura Durruti</a>, was the most
famous unit, fielding thousands of fighters and implementing anarchist
principles on the battlefield.[^15][^16]

### Korean Anarchist Federation (1929-1931)

In Manchuria, Korean anarchists established the **Korean People's
Association** and organized military units defending autonomous zones.
Led by figures like
"<a   href="Kim_Chwa-chin.md" class="wikilink" title="Kim Chwa-chin">Kim
Chwa-chin</a>, these forces protected anarchist communes from Japanese
forces and local warlords, controlling an area with approximately 2
million inhabitants.[^17]

### Mexican Revolution (1910s)

The **Magonista forces** led by
"<a   href="Ricardo_Flores_Magón.md" class="wikilink"
title="Ricardo Flores Magón">Ricardo Flores Magón</a> and the Partido
Liberal Mexicano conducted military campaigns in Baja California and
other regions. They briefly controlled several towns and attempted to
establish anarchist communes before being defeated by federal
forces.[^18]

### Other 20th Century Examples

The **Kronstadt sailors** (1917-1921) played a crucial role in the
October Revolution and later rebelled against Bolshevik authority in
1921, advocating for "free soviets."[^19]

The **Strandzha Commune** (1903) saw Bulgarian anarchists briefly
establish an autonomous zone with armed defenders in the Strandzha
Mountains.[^20]

## Contemporary Forces

### Zapatista Army (1994-present)

The **Zapatista Army of National Liberation** (EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico
emerged publicly in 1994 and has maintained autonomous territories
since. Key features include:

- Military positions rotate among community members
- Decisions flow from autonomous community assemblies through "mandar
  obedeciendo" (leading by obeying)
- Military wing subordinated to civilian indigenous communities
- Territorial control maintained for 30 years while rejecting state
  power

The Zapatistas explicitly reject seeking state power, instead defending
autonomous municipalities practicing direct democracy, gender equality,
and indigenous self-governance.[^21][^22]

### Rojava/Syrian Democratic Forces (2012-present)

The **YPG/YPJ** (People's/Women's Protection Units) and broader Syrian
Democratic Forces implement "democratic confederalism" influenced by
"<a   href="Murray_Bookchin.md" class="wikilink"
title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a> and
"<a   href="Abdullah_Öcalan.md" class="wikilink"
title="Abdullah Öcalan">Abdullah Öcalan</a>:

- Dual leadership with male and female co-commanders at every level
- YPJ operates as autonomous women's military force
- Decisions incorporate military councils and civilian democratic
  assemblies
- Multi-ethnic composition with proportional representation

They played the primary ground role in defeating ISIS in Syria while
maintaining internal democratic structures. The integration of women's
liberation as a core military principle is unprecedented at this
scale.[^23][^24]

## Organizational Characteristics

### Common Features

Anti-authoritarian armies typically share:

- **Voluntary association** - fighters join freely and can leave
- **Elected officers** - commanders chosen by troops and subject to
  recall
- **Rotating positions** - leadership roles rotate to prevent power
  concentration
- **Assembly decisions** - major strategic choices made collectively
- **Minimal hierarchy** - reduced rank structures compared to
  conventional forces
- **Political integration** - revolutionary education combined with
  military training
- **Communal resources** - egalitarian distribution of supplies and
  equipment

### Military Effectiveness

These forces demonstrate varying combat effectiveness. Success factors
include:

- Strong ideological commitment compensating for material disadvantages
- Guerrilla tactics suited to non-hierarchical organization
- Local population support providing intelligence and resources
- Ability to adapt quickly through democratic feedback

#### Tactical Command Authority

Many anti-authoritarian forces recognize the necessity of temporary
command authority during combat situations, implementing what anarchist
theorists call the "captain at sea" or "chief during war" principle.
This concept acknowledges that in moments of immediate danger or battle,
democratic deliberation becomes impractical and potentially fatal.[^25]

The Makhnovists explicitly adopted this approach, where commanders had
full tactical authority during engagements but returned to equal status
afterward. As Makhno explained, "In battle, discipline and the execution
of orders are essential, but this discipline is freely accepted and
based on political consciousness."[^26]

Similarly, CNT-FAI militia columns granted their elected military
delegates enhanced decision-making powers during combat operations,
while maintaining democratic control over strategic decisions. The
Durruti Column's regulations stated that "during action, the delegate's
orders must be followed immediately, but all decisions can be reviewed
by the assembly afterward."[^27]

Modern forces like the YPG/YPJ have formalized this principle through
their "tactical autonomy, strategic democracy" doctrine, where field
commanders exercise immediate battlefield authority within
democratically determined strategic frameworks.[^28]

This temporary delegation of authority serves several purposes:

- **Rapid response** - enabling split-second tactical decisions
- **Clear communication** - establishing unambiguous command chains
  during chaos
- **Operational security** - preventing intelligence leaks through
  excessive consultation
- **Combat effectiveness** - matching the response speed of hierarchical
  opponents

The key distinction from traditional military hierarchy lies in the
temporary, limited, and accountable nature of this authority. Commanders
who abuse their tactical authority or make poor decisions face immediate
recall once combat ends.

Challenges include:

- Difficulty coordinating large-scale operations
- Tensions between military necessity and democratic principles
- Vulnerability to better-equipped conventional forces
- Balancing tactical autonomy with strategic accountability

## Contemporary Significance

Modern anti-authoritarian forces have evolved beyond traditional
anarchism, developing sophisticated approaches balancing military
effectiveness with democratic principles. They demonstrate:

- **Sustained viability** - some maintaining control for decades
- **Intersectional approaches** - integrating gender, ethnic, and
  ecological concerns
- **Hybrid structures** - combining delegation and direct democracy
- **Territorial governance** - moving beyond pure military resistance

These experiments face ongoing challenges including external military
pressure, internal security needs, and necessary compromises with pure
horizontal principles.
