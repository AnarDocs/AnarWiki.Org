Egyptian anarchists, with leadership from the visiting Italian
insurrectionist Luigi Galleani, established the Free Popular University
(UPL) in 1901 in Alexandria. It hosted political lectures and offered
classes in science and the humanities. Classes were taught in Italian,
French, Arabic and other languages. According to scholar Anthony Gorman,
"bourgeois elements" seized control of the university within a year.
However, Gorman writes, "the UPL marks an important moment for anarchism
in Egypt and almost certainly served as an inspiration to Egyptian
nationalists who would establish the Higher Social Clubs (*Nadi
al-madaris al-'ulya*) in 1905 which similarly put educational means to
political purpose."[^1]

Egypt's Anarchist movement, pioneered by Italian immigrants in the
1860s, attracted significant participation from native Egyptians after
1900. The movement became prominent in labor struggles and struggled
against British occupation alongside the nationalist movement.[^2]
