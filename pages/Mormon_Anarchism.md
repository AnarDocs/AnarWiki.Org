# Mormon Anarchism

## History

**Mormon Anarchism** refers to the intersection of
"<a   href="Mormonism.md" class="wikilink" title="Mormonism">"Mormonism</a> and
"<a   href="anarchist.md" class="wikilink" title="anarchist">"anarchist</a>
political philosophy, particularly
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">"Christian anarchism</a>. This tradition
draws on historical Mormon communitarian experiments and scriptural
teachings about economic equality to argue for the abolition of both the
"<a   href="State.md" class="wikilink" title="State">"State</a> and
"<a   href="capitalism.md" class="wikilink" title="capitalism">"capitalism</a>.
While most contemporary Mormons hold conservative political views,
Mormon anarchism contends that the consistent application of Mormon
scripture should lead believers toward anarchist conclusions.

### Origins

The theological foundations of Mormon anarchism rest on 19th-century
Mormon communitarian practices. Between 1830 and the 1880s, members of
"<a   href="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints.md"
class="wikilink"
title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">"The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> attempted to implement the **Law
of Consecration** and **United Order**, systems of economic cooperation
where members voluntarily consecrated their property to a common
fund.[^1]

Under
"<a   href="Brigham_Young.md" class="wikilink" title="Brigham Young">"Brigham
Young</a>'s leadership beginning in 1874, the church established the
United Order of Enoch in at least 200 Mormon communities throughout
"<a   href="Utah_Territory.md" class="wikilink" title="Utah Territory">"Utah
Territory</a>.[^2] The **Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution**
(ZCMI), founded in 1869, became the central distributor of goods as a
member-owned cooperative. These cooperatives were explicitly designed to
"guard against the development of a moneyed class" and ensure that "no
one person was making exorbitant profits."[^3]

The most notable United Order community was
"<a   href="Orderville.md" class="wikilink" title="Orderville">"Orderville</a>,
which continued until 1885 when anti-polygamy enforcement under the
"<a   href="Edmunds_Act.md" class="wikilink" title="Edmunds Act">"Edmunds
Act</a> effectively ended the experiment by jailing its leaders.

### Plotino Rhodakanaty

The first explicitly anarchist Mormon was **Plotino Constantino
Rhodakanaty** (1828-c.1890), a Greek immigrant to
"<a   href="Mexico.md" class="wikilink" title="Mexico">"Mexico</a> who became
the first Mormon convert, first ordained Elder, and first branch
president in Mexico in 1879.[^4]

Rhodakanaty was a student of
"<a   href="Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon.md" class="wikilink"
title="Pierre-Joseph Proudhon">"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a> and had
traveled to Paris in 1850 specifically to meet the French anarchist.
Before encountering Mormonism, Rhodakanaty founded **La Social**, the
first socialist organization in Mexico, and established the **School of
Light and Socialism** to teach peasants literacy and Fourier-Proudhonian
anarchist-socialism.[^5]

Rhodakanaty was drawn to Mormonism because he saw it as embodying the
primitive Christian church, which he characterized as "in essence
totally democratic." He believed Mormon communities were practicing
agrarian socialism and viewed the Gospel as "a plan of social redemption
rooted in the values of equality, solidarity, charity, justice, liberty
and brotherly love."[^6]

However, Rhodakanaty resigned as branch president after only nine months
when church leadership rejected proposals to establish United
Order-style agrarian communities in Mexico. He returned to
"<a   href="Europe.md" class="wikilink" title="Europe">"Europe</a> shortly
thereafter, though his influence on Mexican labor and agrarian movements
continued.

### Current Status

Contemporary Mormon anarchism emerged in 2007 with the founding of **The
Mormon Worker**, a newspaper and blog in
"<a   href="Provo.md" class="wikilink" title="Provo">"Provo</a> and
"<a   href="Salt_Lake_City.md" class="wikilink" title="Salt Lake City">"Salt
Lake City</a>, "<a   href="Utah.md" class="wikilink" title="Utah">"Utah</a>.
Founded by William Van Wagenen, a Harvard Divinity School graduate and
returned missionary, the publication was modeled after
"<a   href="The_Catholic_Worker.md" class="wikilink"
title="The Catholic Worker">"The Catholic Worker</a> founded by
"<a   href="Dorothy_Day.md" class="wikilink" title="Dorothy Day">"Dorothy
Day</a> and
"<a   href="Peter_Maurin.md" class="wikilink" title="Peter Maurin">"Peter
Maurin</a>.[^7]

Van Wagenen founded the paper after working with
"<a   href="Christian_Peacemaker_Teams.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian Peacemaker Teams">"Christian Peacemaker Teams</a> in
"<a   href="Iraq.md" class="wikilink" title="Iraq">"Iraq</a>, where he was
kidnapped for nine days and his roommate Tom Fox was murdered by
terrorists. Upon returning to Utah, Van Wagenen connected with other
Mormons concerned with social justice issues they felt were ignored by
their community.[^8]

The Mormon Worker explores the compatibility of Mormonism with
"<a   href="Christian_anarchism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian anarchism">"Christian anarchism</a> and
"<a   href="Christian_pacifism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Christian pacifism">"Christian pacifism</a>, arguing that core
Mormon teachings about cooperation, charity, and social equality align
with anarchist principles. The publication does not seek to criticize
church leadership but rather to examine radical elements within the
Mormon tradition.[^9]

The Mormon Worker was a member of the Latter-Day Saints Coalition
Against Torture, which opposed interrogation techniques used during the
"<a   href="War_on_Terror.md" class="wikilink" title="War on Terror">"War on
Terror</a>.[^10]

## Organisation

Mormon anarchism operates primarily through informal networks and
publications rather than formal organizational structures. The Mormon
Worker publishes quarterly and accepts submissions from people of
varying religious and secular backgrounds. The views expressed are
explicitly stated as not representing official positions of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[^11]

The movement emphasizes voluntary association and cooperation over
hierarchical organization, consistent with anarchist principles of
"<a   href="mutual_aid.md" class="wikilink" title="mutual aid">"mutual aid</a>
and "<a   href="free_association.md" class="wikilink"
title="free association">"free association</a>.

## Criticism

### Conservative Mormon Opposition

Some conservative church members have criticized The Mormon Worker's
positions, though founder William Van Wagenen asserted the response has
been "largely positive." Van Wagenen claimed more Mormons, including
young people and some conservatives, had become conflicted about
capitalism and disillusioned with the
"<a   href="Iraq_War.md" class="wikilink" title="Iraq War">"Iraq War</a>.[^12]

Some sympathetic observers have suggested the anarchistic language may
be easily misunderstood and avoided by potential Mormon readers.[^13]

### Official Church Position

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has formally
distinguished the United Order from
"<a   href="communism.md" class="wikilink" title="communism">"communism</a>,
stating that "Communism and all other similar isms bear no relationship
whatever to the United Order. They are merely the clumsy counterfeits
which Satan always devises of the Gospel plan. The United Order leaves
every man free to choose his own religion as his conscience directs.
Communism destroys man's God-given free agency."[^14]

However, Mormon anarchists argue this critique applies specifically to
"<a   href="Marxism-Leninism.md" class="wikilink"
title="Marxist-Leninist">"Marxist-Leninist</a> state communism rather
than anarchist forms of voluntary cooperation, which they contend
actually embody United Order principles.

### Apocryphal Tolstoy Quote

A widely circulated quote attributed to author and anarchist
"<a   href="Leo_Tolstoy.md" class="wikilink" title="Leo Tolstoy">"Leo
Tolstoy</a> praising Mormonism has been used to suggest external
validation of Mormon anarchist principles. However, a 2014 study by
"<a   href="Brigham_Young_University.md" class="wikilink"
title="Brigham Young University">"Brigham Young University</a> confirmed
that "numerous folk tales exist in the church about how Tolstoy
envisioned Mormonism to become 'the next great world religion,' \[but\]
there is simply no evidence to support such claims."[^15] The fabricated
quote has appeared as recently as 2017 in LDS publications.
